Drafts:

(Obi-Wan POV)

Outline: What if, when Anakin was three, he and Shmi as slaves were not sold to Gardulla the Hutt and lost to Toydarian Watto in Tatooine, instead, they were sold to an underground black market in Coruscant. The owner lost them shortly (the owner died?), they don't have anywhere else to go but try to manage their life in low Coruscant. Shmi died shortly, Anakin grow up alone with other homeless orphan kids in low Coruscant, manage to survive in the hard life, do a lot of small outlaw things to support himself, stealing etc. to get food and money, run away from police a lot, try build his own robot and ship from scraps he can find.

Coruscant is corrupted Republic, Palpatine has jedi and congress all in control, all the incorporative jedis persecuted including Yoda/Windu, jedi's get brainwashed to become Palpatine's personal police. ep3 timeline (19BBY), Palpatine becomes emperor, city in strict control, no expression freedom. Obi-Wan is tasked to clean out low Coruscant. Anakin join secret rebel force, advocating rebellion with graffiti art. They run into each other, Obi-Wan notice Anakin's jedi potential, impressed, start hesitating, chase around, start appreciate the art (graffiti actually code for assemblies, words/colors have special meanings, they have a set of secret word, red/purple/yellow=danger/drop everything and run, green/blue=safe/proceed as plan), get lured to underground rebellious meeting, given the option of join them and fight against emperor and very likely die, or comply with jedi brainwash doctrine.

Obi-Wan starts to change side, learn more about Anakin and his past and ideation, join rebellion, start training Anakin properly. The two become popular among people, new leaders they're willing to follow. Obi-Wan meanwhile acts as their double agent in Jedi and near Palpatine. They would have waited until Anakin is ready to make the move, but Obi-Wan is already suspected by Palpatine, almost get prosecuted, get info leak (graffiti encoding meaning leak), know rebels are in danger (Dooku? Maul? other corrupted Jedi's?) forced to have an earlier movement, jump-start/lead revolution. Anakin go into citadel with the group, try to rescue Obi-Wan but find he already escape, ready to warn them. The two work together, assassin Palpatine (Anakin lost right hand in fight), convert/defeat Dooku/Maul, announce empire falls by drafting a huge graffiti on wall saying "Free".

(Notes: Obikin eye color both blue, so blue is safe)

(Optional prompts: The city was becoming more depressing as the authority stamps out different voices and forms of expression under the rule of Palpatine. However, as Obi-Wan tries to catch up with the notorious graffiti artist the star chaser... he came to appreciate the rebellious side of life...)

(Hard No's: Bottom Obi-Wan, bathroom kinks, unhappy endings, too much violence, other pairings other than present Obikin, non-con)

(Mental reference: Cyberpunk 2077, graffiti artist=rock star, Anakin=Johnny Silverhand, Obi-Wan=V)
