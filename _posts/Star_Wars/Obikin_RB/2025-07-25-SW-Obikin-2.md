The Lower Level isn't just one single level, or anything close to just a button on an elevator panel that is placed at the bottom of all the levels.

It's all the places below the ground. All the levels that cannot see the sky. The underground world.

Obi-Wan gets off the speeder, tugging his tunic closer, wrapping himself with his arms under the coat, as if that way he could blend in with local people here -- as if there is any *people* to be blended in.

He examines the empty streets, one level at a time, starting from Level Zero to lower.

No one is on the street.

The world is quiet and dead down here, as is above the ground. The curfew and martial orders have been complied strictly, much to the Emperor's satisfaction.

There are droids and troopers stationed on each level for regular maintenance and surveillance, to handle everyday peace-keeping martial tasks. So as far as Obi-Wan can see, assigning Jedi down here is more or less a waste of effort, unless there is any outburst severe enough that combat skills were to be needed -- but if that happened, it might as well be the trigger for another clone war again -- which isn't anything a single Jedi can possible handle -- just between the people and the Empire. Obi-Wan doesn't know if he's ready for anything like that again so soon. The peace under the Empire's choking control is at least, still peace, still a time for some breath.

His mind wanders around as he walks down the street, his eyes scanning around the open spaces on each level, his feeling dissolving into the Force around them.

From Level Zero to Level Four, the lower he reaches, the shabbier and narrower the streets become. The houses are smaller, lower, more broken. Doors and windows are covered with paper and clothe patches, even a wooden plank patch would be a luxury. Barely any street light.

No living creature in sight. As if he's just walking around on a detonated, nuclear wasted planet.

Obi-Wan speeds up his steps, not wanting to stay too long in any of these levels.

He goes to the Level Five next.

There is something different about Level Five, he senses it as soon as he steps out of the speeder. The vision, the smell, the rigorousness, a living life form in a dead city. It takes his conscious mind one more second to realize what's the difference.

The street walls are not barren and grey. Not the dirty color with occasional red and black smudges that look like nothing other than dried blood.

However, in here, the walls are unbelievably colorful, with bright colors scattering all over the color spectrum, as if painting palettes for rainbows are poured onto the walls. There are words and sentences too, together with graffities of cartoonized figures, exaggerated creations, images of random creatures, symbols that aren't any known language to his knowledge. The end of brushes are almost always rushed, with visible unclean stroke, as if whoever did this has to finish the thing in a tight time frame.

Obi-Wan walks down the street, staring at those graffities with wide eyes. People are getting bold and reckless down here. That sense of disturbance in the Force is getting stronger the longer he looks at them. He fidgets uneasily as he examines them.

The paints those graffities were using seem normal enough, the cheap kind that one can find anywhere, probably even locally in each level. The content, however, maybe has something worth noticing -- though he can't really understand what they're about for the most of part. They are like doodling, coming out of wild imagination of a five-year-old. It's refreshing in an almost disturbing way.

He doesn't know how to make of it -- so he reports it in, like the new Jedi code the Emperor required.

<br>

The Emperor assembles an emergency meeting the very next day, calling Obi-Wan to report what he saw. Officers and representatives from different areas of expertise are requested. Count Dooku, The Emperor's personal guard stands right behind his throne.

Obi-Wan tries his best to explain those abstract bright lines and curves and patterns, realizing words are too pale to describe, one has to see to know what he's talking about. He finishes awkwardly with that exact suggestion.

Emperor Palpatine asks him to go back to his seat.

A group of representatives of the meeting says it's nothing to worry about, maybe just a kid messing around. Another says it's a clear and aggressive sign of rebellion against the Empire, anyone involved in it should be executed immediately. And another asks nonchalantly why that is even a problem.

The Emperor coughs loudly, and starts speaking slowly: "This is a gesture of dissatisfaction from a small group of people, lashing out their childish emotions on public properties. This should not be allowed. Those paintings might increase the doubt in people's mind, affecting the brief peace we have fought so hard to earn and finally have now. I will add the new regulation in tonight's announcements to prohibit such behavior."

Therefore by night, when the new and old regulations are being broadcast, Obi-Wan isn't exactly surprised to find out a newly added regulation, but hearing the exact words still makes his heart twist in discomfort. The new regulation says: "Any and all, public or private, display of all formats, regarding personal expression unaligned with the Empire Value is illegal, including but not limited to street art, street painting, street performance. Therefore, certain behaviors like graffiti are strictly forbidden, and anyone who conducted this illegal behavior will be held legal responsibility, arrested and personally investigated by The Emperor and the highest security team."

By "highest security team," he undoubtedly means Count Dooku himself.

Obi-Wan chokes on the water he's drinking, feeling a sick wrench at the lower of his stomach, as if he's both punched there hard and going to vomit at the same time.

He rushes toward the door of his chamber.

And runs right into Count Dooku.

Obi-Wan halts harshly, holding on the door to steady himself, more startled than surprised. "Count Dooku," he greets, trying his best to keep his voice and breath stable.

Count Dooku eyes him, "Jedi master Kenobi, so good to see you. The Emperor has an assignment for you. We have reason to believe those graffities are signs where a new rebellion force is forming, endangering the peace and stability of the Empire. You are tasked to find those dangerous rebellion sources, and take them to the Emperor. If you fail, *I* will go to the Lower Level myself. Do you understand?"

"Yes, perfectly clear. I will be on my way to the Lower Level immediately," Obi-Wan hears his voice answer automatically.

Count Dooku nods once with approval, still watching him. His gaze lays a heavy, palpable weight on Obi-Wan's back like a snake winding around a prey, as he dashes down the corridor toward his speeder.

Descending into the darkness of the Lower Level has never before feels so comforting. Just to know the distance from the choking air up there increases as he flies down makes his clenched heart uncoiling -- even just the slightest, he still doesn't know what exactly he'd be running into down there, and what he'd do if he finds those people.

Obi-Wan breathes more easily and steadily with the artificial wind when he arrives Level Five.

<br>

The street comes to life when the morning comes.

The night didn't give him much extra information, so Obi-Wan thinks he might as well wait until the day time to continue his investigation.

The view shifts so much compared to curfewed nights he can barely recognize it's the same place. The walls are still covered with colorful markings and doodles, but with pedestrians dressed in exotic cloth from so many different alien culture, it's hard to tell apart which colors are stationary on the walls, which ones moving with the local people.

Obi-Wan steps closer to the walls, standing before the one near the end of the street, watching it closely.

He doesn't know much about art, or painting, or whatever style this may be called in academia -- abstractionism or something along the line -- he just hopes the observation can give him some answer of where to locate the mysterious now-number-one-wanted graffiti artist.

The longer he stares, the more senses those characters and patterns seem to be presenting themselves. He thinks he can spot a few repetitive pattern with certain combination of colors and characters. But it could also be coincidences that his mind is just making up theories he wishes to see.

Encryption and decryption isn't his best school work, nor is art. Obi-Wan sighs, taking out his personal hologram, starts taking record of these arts to take back for analysis in the Jedi library computer later.

He doesn't realize the way his feet was taking him along the painted wall leads toward the end of the alley, where the bar that almost caused him that fight with the locals located, until he's already at its door.

The last graffiti ends outside the bar.

Obi-Wan halts his steps sharply in front of the bar, ready to take a turn. It is at this exact moment, a figure emerges from the exit door, almost bumping right into him.

"Excuse me," a familiar, young voice says.

Obi-Wan looks up at the face. "It's you."

That reckless, defiant, young boy with blue eyes glares back at him. His eyes narrow with recognition, "You again, Jedi."

"Jedi Master Kenobi," Obi-Wan can't help correcting him.

"I remember," the boy smirks, looking right back at him, the same way he did last time. His cloth is more dirty than last time -- no, not "dirty," more colorful. More paints with the same set of bright colors on those walls has left marks and smudges on his thin shirt and cheap jacket. In his hands, he's holding a handful of spray cans.

Obi-Wan's heart sinks when his eyes land on those. Yet somehow, he thinks he already knows it even before running into the boy again.

The boy follows his gaze and sees where his attention gets attracted to. He shifts his arms so the cans are half hidden behind his body.

"I see you're interested in arts," Obi-Wan comments cautiously, glancing at the painted walls beside them. "Did you not hear the latest regulation announced last night? The street arts and graffities are strictly forbidden now."

The boy quirks a smirking smile, "I wonder who did those arts, I'll make sure to let them know not to do that again." The silent challenge is more than loud enough for Obi-Wan to hear in his undertones: "You don't have proof it's me, that's why you're just standing here staring at me, what are you going to do, Kenobi?"

Which is exactly why Obi-Wan can't take him in now -- he'll need more proof than the cans to call the boy suspicious or guilty. He'll have to catch him in action or something of the kind.

Obi-Wan can do nothing but glare at him.

Another voice calls across the street: "Ani, you coming or not?"

The boy's head jerks to the source of the voice. "In a minute," he yells back.

Obi-Wan raises his eyebrows in a joyful beam. "So it's Ani."

"It's 'Anakin' to you," the boy snaps. "'Ani' is only for my friends."

"Alright, Anakin," Obi-Wan says compliantly, voice more soft, glancing at the spray cans in his hands again. "Just so you know, whoever is painting those, I'll have to arrest them if I find them."

Anakin shrugs carelessly. "Then I'll make sure they are never found." He turns to catch up with his friends.

Obi-Wan watches his back with a lump in his throat.

He goes back to study the paintings for the rest of the day, and he doesn't run into Anakin for another three days.
