### Setups

What if, when Anakin was three, he and Shmi were not sold to the Hutts and Watto in Tatooine during slave trade, instead, they were sold to an underground black market art smuggler in Coruscant. Ani started learning/having interest in art by watching/witnessing/helping out those art transactions, Shmi encouraged him to learn painting, it distracted him from slave life. The smuggler died in some art dealer auction conflict shortly and they were let go in chaos (no one cared about them, not realized they're gone). Shmi died shortly after due to some sickness, Anakin grew up alone (with other homeless orphan kids, e.g. Kitster Banai, Wald, Amee) in lower Coruscant, managed to survive on his own in the hard life, did a lot of small outlaw things to support himself, steal/rob/pick up dumpster to get food/money/everything, ran away from police a lot, get into trouble a lot, still try to make art (initially because it comforts him and make him think of mom, later find out more practical usage.)

ep1 timeline, without Ani, Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan didn't go into pod racing bet, didn't get hyperdrive to fix ship, stuck in Tatooine, got caught up by Maul. Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan 2v1 fought Maul, Qui-Gon/Maul died, Padme/Obi-Wan went back to Coruscant in Maul's ship, Palpatine became chancellor. Coruscant was corrupted late Republic stage.

ep2 timeline, Palpatine started clone war, had Jedi and senate all in control. ep3 timeline (current, 19 BBY), Palpatine becomes emperor, all uncooperative Jedi were persecuted or went hiding (e.g. Yoda/Windu disappeared) (=canon Order 66), remaining Jedi mostly get brainwashed/forced to become Palpatine's personal police force. Without Anakin, Dooku is still alive so far, active in conducting Palpatine's orders.

Coruscant the whole city is in strict martial control, has curfew, random arrest for any violation, no free expression, no freedom, reign of terror. Obi-Wan is tasked to clean out lower Coruscant instability sources (Obi-Wan already hesitant about Palpatine and everything but not defiant yet, "not set in stone"). Anakin join/form/lead secret rebel force, starting with childhood friends, advocating rebellion with graffiti art. They run into each other, Obi-Wan notices Anakin's Jedi potential, impressed, starts swaying, chases around, starts to appreciate the art (graffiti actually are code words for assemblies, words/certain color combinations have special meanings, they have a set of secret word, red+some shape=danger, purple/yellow=drop everything and run, blue=safe, green+certain keyword=next meeting time/location and proceed as usual), gets tricked to underground rebellious meeting, given the option of join them and fight against emperor and very likely die, or comply with Jedi brainwash doctrine and fight against rebels, neither know if he'd get harmed by rebels or he'd win and bring Anakin in, which would likely cause Anakin executed by Dooku.

Obi-Wan's decision point, has to choose a side, start with only small help/subtle sign of slipping to their side, e.g. a few times when chasing around he actually already run into Anakin/could have arrested him but deliberately pretend as if missed. slow(/steep?) slip, every decision point actually all chooses Anakin, very clear starting to change side, take more and more interest in Anakin, learn more about him and his past and ideation, the two of them talk more, learn about each other more, start join rebellion meetings (start with only listen at outer rim, not speak), start secretly training Anakin properly, teach him use weapons and Force power. The two become popular among the group, come up with actual real attacking plans, Obi-Wan give them useful suggestion to actually do some real rebel fight against Empire's controlled troops/facilities and win, slowly turn to new leaders people willing to follow.

Obi-Wan meanwhile acts as their double agent in Jedi and near Palpatine. They planned to wait until Anakin is ready to make the final move on Palpatine, but Obi-Wan is already suspected by Palpatine, get confined/tortured/interrogated, very close to be prosecuted (charge of traitorous/treason), know there is info leak (graffiti encoding meaning is leaked, someone from inside might get turned, has rat), know rebels are in danger (Dooku is tasked to kill them all). they all are forced to start the revolution movement earlier than planned, jump-start full-on revolution, Obi-Wan/Anakin in lead. Anakin go into Imperial Palace with the group, has disagreement within team of whether the goal is mainly to rescue Obi-Wan or assassinate Palpatine, Anakin faces the option of either killing Palpatine or saving Obi-Wan, and chooses Obi-Wan, gets himself in danger (run into Dooku, fight, get his right hand cut, like canon).

It turns out Obi-Wan manage to escape on his own (wounded but nonfatal), ready to leave to warn them, come back to rescue Anakin, the two kill Dooku. Obi-Wan uses Force heal to stabilize Anakin's handicapped hand, Anakin furious, desperate, fear can't paint again. Obi-Wan suggests retreat for now, Anakin insists see it through, now or never. The two back-to-back fight together, Anakin is forced to use left hand fighting, non-dominant hand but the move become unexpected, successfully kills Palpatine, they liberate the city, announce empire falls by drawing a huge blue graffiti on wall saying "Free". people want them be new leaders, they suggest building new Republic but need more help, sending out invite to hidden Jedi/senators in all plantes, inviting more wise people to reestablish democracy (e.g. look for Yoda, etc.). There are more work need to be done to build the new order, but good thing that they have each other.

## Main

### Chap 1 (Encounter)

> Coruscant the whole city is in strict martial control, has curfew, random arrest for any violation, no free expression, no freedom, reign of terror. Obi-Wan is tasked to clean out lower Coruscant instability sources (Obi-Wan already hesitant about Palpatine and everything but not defiant yet, "not set in stone").
>

At seven, all the outdoor screens and holograms are synchronized to the empire broadcast channel, so are the indoor displays in every habitant's house.

It is the same in Coruscant as it is in every planet in the galaxy.

Near the window of his chamber, facing outside, Obi-Wan stands stiffly straight. The view has never stopped looking uneasy, no matter how many times he witnesses. It has been four years, since the announcement of the First Galactic Empire.

The images in the screens and holograms shift at the same time, from an electrical black to the face of Empire Palpatine, smiling kindly at the screen -- as if he's just that same old kind senator from Naboo, recently selected as the chancellor, with the only difference being the title and addressing now becoming "Emperor." His face, large and small, high and low, are displayed on every inch of the screens around the city, his eyes staring at every citizen of the galaxy from all different angles.

Obi-Wan can't help a shiver, and doesn't allow himself to think of why.

He is a Jedi that serves this galaxy, be it republic or empire, his duty remains the same -- for the benefit of the people. And if the empire ensures the peace and prosperity, stops the war, serves people food, then so be it. He would follow the orders and do his job, even if the order now comes from Emperor Palpatine, instead of Jedi Master Counsel, or Senate and Court.

He still turns away from the window when the speech begins. Light shifts outside his window, casting colorful shadows on the opposite wall. He stands in the dark, listening, with his eyes chained on the wall.

The announcement is almost expectable every day -- start with a warm and kind greeting from Emperor Palpatine, talking about how valuable peace and quietness in the city and in the galaxy is, after the four-year-long Clone Wars, and the necessity of the Order 66. The empire is not yet in a stable state, there are still rebellions and separatists that are wishing to see the empire breaking apart, see people's lives suffer in wars. And Coruscant as the capitol is undoubtably their first target. That is why the strict martial order is still necessary in the city, the curfew is at eight, any violation with the order will be arrested, any expression that endangers the safety of the empire will be arrested. If, upon investigation, such violation are vindicated guilty, the involved personnel will be executed. Everything is for the safety of the empire and all the lawful citizens living under the empire's protection. Ending with "Enjoy a good night. Long live the Galactic Empire."

The streets are quiet outside. Empty, ghostly quiet. The curfew officially starts at eight, but after four years, people already know well enough to stay inside after the sun down -- Jedi patrol would already start when the speech begins, ensuring no one interfering and jeopardizing the public safety, from Upper Level to Lower Level of the city.

People have also learned well enough to not protest against Jedi patrols or security guards -- not publicly on street anyway. Obi-Wan rubs his temples, missing the old days. People seem to forget they used to be peace keepers, during the republic time. They were respected, looked up to. And now --

He remembers the disgusted looks from people when he walked past them to examine an suspicious-looking bar in the Lower Level, not long ago. The bar turned out legit, with all the complete certifications and registrations. So he walked out with empty hands, ready to report back to the Imperial Palace -- which used to be the Jedi Temple, another thing that he tried not to think too hard every time he headed in and out.

One of the patrons spat at his back: "That's right, run back to your master, you spineless hatchet man, murderer of the freedom."

The whole bar fell dead silent. Quiet enough to hear his own heartbeat, and every single beings'.

He turned back slowly, forcing his hand in place, staying by his side, instead of reaching automatically for his lightsaber like all these years of training and his muscle memory demanded.

The voice was young. Merely a boy not knowing any better. There was no need to get into trouble with them. He wasn't even there for them.

Obi-Wan examined the bar, patrons under his eyes all looked away uneasily, many still having that lingering expression of distaste on their faces, a few glancing at the speaker worriedly. The boy looked barely twenty, tall and slim, in humble clothes that were too short at the end of ankles and wrists, with dirty smudges of paintings layered on top -- typical look of a Lower Level kid, if he was even legit to live in the city.

Obi-Wan regarded him, scrutinizing him with a look that most adults would choose to look away or fidget uneasily. The boy didn't look away. His eyes were sharp, too sharp for his age -- or maybe kids were just tend to grow faster nowadays, he wouldn't know. He wasn't the first boy Obi-Wan ran into that had that look of defiance in his eyes, and definitely wouldn't be the last, as long as the Empire exists, as long as the creature called "boy" exists.

And they were blue. Obi-Wan remembers himself thinking. Those young eyes, looking into his like the eyes of an eagle born on the cliff and grow on the sea, a look of a wild creature, a trouble-maker.

He swallowed, shifting slightly, keeping his gaze on the boy's forehead instead. "What's your name?" he asked, taking a step forward.

The crowd in the bar stepped back automatically, emptying out a five-feet opening around them.

The boy did not move. He tightened his jaw, lifting his chins. "Who wants to know?"

There was a quiet gasp in the crowd, some worried whisper.

Obi-Wan glanced outside. The daylight was running out fast -- the sky was too far away from the Lower Level to see, it was always dark around here, the artificial light simulated the daylight, and these were turning darker. And the temperature in the air was dropping. Soon, it would be the curfew. He would have to take them into custody according to the new curfew regulation if this farce lasted any longer.

He wouldn't want to get into the trouble of taking all those people to the Custody Center and filing all the paperwork, as much as these people having any interest of moving. But right now, with his presence, they weren't even dare to move, let alone leaving the place.

Might as well call it a day and end the whole damn thing quickly. Even if it means let the boy think he won the round, with that satisfied smirk on the tip of his lips.

Obi-Wan sighed, "Jedi Master Kenobi, on official empire duty," he told him, and the crowd.

Probably the friendliest olive branch they'd ever seen and will ever see from an imperial law enforcer.

"Well, Kenobi," the boy said, aggressively, not caring about using the correct addressing, in a tone far too cold and remote, "Are you going to arrest me, for telling the truth? Are you not working for the empire to destroy the democracy and freedom, and ruin our lives?"

"You should arrest all of us then," another voice in the crowd said. He didn't pay attention who, presumably some friends of this kid, exactly as reckless and mindless as he was.

Obi-Wan took another step forward, standing right in front of the boy -- who was about the same height as him, Obi-Wan realized. With this close distance, those dazzling blue eyes were as clean as the stars, reflecting his own image.

Obi-Wan looked into his eyes, lowering his voice. "You should be more careful, boy, and show me some respect." He warned him, biting on the word "boy" a little too hard than necessary. "Don't give me a reason to. Next time, I might have to. And you know damn well I will."

He didn't wait for an answer. Casting a quick glance at the surrounding crowd, he told them "As you were," and left the bar.

For days, that pair of blue eyes and the accusations he was shouted at haunted him. Obi-Wan went to the meditation room more frequently than usual, but his mind still refused to quiet.

He stares at the wall in his chamber, and wonders if the boy is also listening to the same message from the Emperor's broadcast somewhere down in the Lower Level of the city; if he was stupid enough to get himself into trouble with other Jedi patrols or imperial troopers -- he wouldn't be surprised if he did.

There is something around the boy that bothers him. He can't even tell if it is a disturbance in the Force around him, or just the disturbed mind of himself. The boy is already a trouble just by standing there in the room. For a brief moment, he wished his old Master was still here, telling him the answer, guiding him the right way.

Obi-Wan sighs, burying the thoughts. He shouldn't be wondering about those nonsenses, he's just doing his job nowadays. Get assigned new tasks everyday, complete them, go back chamber to rest for a few hours, continue the next day. Sometimes he doesn't know if he has any difference with those security bots anymore. Somewhere in the mind and heart, things are just dulled, feelings numbed.

He straightens his tunic, checks the lightsaber and blaster gun in place, and walks out of the room.

Tonight is his turn of patrol. And he is assigned the Lower Level.

early on: mention both Obi-Wan and Anakin have blue eyes, Obi-Wan is more grey blue

### Chap 2 (Chase)

> Obi-Wan runs into Anakin. Anakin join/form/lead secret rebel force, starting with childhood friends, advocating rebellion with graffiti art. Obi-Wan notices Anakin's Jedi potential, impressed, starts swaying, chases around, starts to appreciate the art (graffiti actually are code words for assemblies, words/certain color combinations have special meanings, they have a set of secret word, red+some shape=danger, purple/yellow=drop everything and run, blue=safe, green+certain keyword=next meeting time/location and proceed as usual), gets tricked to underground rebellious meeting (Obi-Wan thinks he starts able to decode the message, but actually they purposefully leave the hint)

The Lower Level isn't just like one single level, or a button on an elevator panel that is placed at the bottom of all the levels.

It's all the place below the ground. All the levels that cannot see the sky. The underground world.

Obi-Wan gets off the speeder, tugging his tunic closer, wrapping himself closer, as if that way he can blend in with people in this world.

He examines the empty streets, one level at a time, starting from Level Zero then lower.

No one is on the street.

The world is quiet and dead down here, as is above the ground.

There are droids and troopers stationed on each level for regular maintenance and surveillance, to handle everyday martial tasks. So as far as Obi-Wan can see, assigning Jedi down here is more or less a waste of effort, unless there is any outburst severe enough that combat skills will be needed -- but if that happens, it might be light another clone war again, just between the people and the empire. Obi-Wan doesn't know if he's ready for anything like that again.

His mind wanders around as he walks down the street, his eyes scanning around the open spaces on each level, his feeling dissolving into the Force around them.

From Level Zero to Level Four, the lower he reaches, the shabbier and narrower the streets become. The houses are smaller, lower, more broken. Doors and windows broken with paper and clothe patches. Barely any street light.

No living creature in sight. As if he's just walking around in a detonated, nuclear wasted planet.

Obi-Wan speeds up his steps, not wanting to stay too long in any of the levels.

He goes to the Level Five next.

There is something different about Level Five, as soon as he steps out of the speeder. It takes his conscious mind one more second to realize what's the difference.

The street walls are not barren and grey. Not the dirty color with occasional red and black smudges that look like nothing other than dried blood.

However, in here, the walls are unbelievably colorful, with bright colors scattering all over the color spectrum, as if rainbow painting palettes are pouring onto the walls. There are words and sentences too, together with graffities of cartoonized figures, exaggerated creations, images of random creatures, symbols that aren't any known language. The end of brushes are almost always rushed, with visible unclean stroke, as if whoever did this has to finish the thing in a tight time frame. 

Obi-Wan walks down the street, staring at those graffities with wide eyes. People are getting bold and reckless down here. That sense of disturbance in the Force is getting stronger the longer he looks at them. He fidgets uneasily as he examines them.

The paints those graffities were using seem normal enough, the cheap kind that one can find anywhere, probably even locally in each level. The content, however, maybe has something worth noticing -- though he can't really understand what they're about for the most of part. They are like doodling, coming out of wild imagination of a five-year-old. It's refreshing in an almost disturbing way.

He doesn't know how to make of it -- so he reports it in, like the new Jedi code the Emperor required.

<br>

The Emperor assembles an emergency meeting the very next day, calling Obi-Wan to report what he saw. Officers and representatives from different areas of expertise are requested. Count Dooku, The Emperor's personal guard stands right behind to his seat.

Obi-Wan tries his best to explain those abstract bright lines and curves and patterns, realizing words are too pale to describe, one has to see to know what he's talking about. He finishes awkwardly with that exact suggestion.

Emperor Palpatine asks him to go back to his seat.

A group of the representatives of the meeting says it's nothing to worry about, maybe just a kid messing around. Another says it's a clear and aggressive sign of rebellion against the empire, anyone involved in it should be executed immediately. And another asks nonchalantly why that is even a problem.

The emperor coughs loudly, and starts speaking slowly: "This is a gesture of dissatisfaction of a small group of people, lashing out their childish emotions on public properties. This should not be allowed. Those paintings might increase the doubt in people's mind, affecting the head-earned brief peace we're having now. I will add the new regulation in tonight's announcements."

Therefore by night, when the new and old regulations are being broadcast, Obi-Wan isn't exactly surprised to find out a newly added regulation, but hearing the exact words still makes his gut twist. The new regulation says: "Any and all, public or private, display of all formats, regarding personal expression unaligned with the Empire Value is illegal, including but not limited to street art, street painting, street performance. Therefore, certain behaviors like graffiti are strictly forbidden, and anyone who conducted this illegal behavior will be held legal responsibility, arrested and personally investigated by The Emperor and his Personal guard."

Obi-Wan spits out the water he's drinking, feeling a sick wrench at the lower of his stomach, as if he's both punched there hard or going to vomit at the same time.

He rushes toward the door of his chamber.

And runs right into Count Dooku.

Obi-Wan halts harshly, holding on the door to steady himself, more startled to surprised. "Count Dooku," he greets, trying his best to keep his voice stable.

Count Dooku eyes him, "Jedi master Kenobi, the Emperor has an assignment for you. We have reason to believe those graffities are signs where a new rebellion force is forming, endangering the peace and stability of the Empire. You are tasked to find those dangerous rebellion sources, and take them to the Emperor. If you fail, I will go to the Lower Level myself. Do you understand?"

"Yes, perfectly clear. I will be on my way to the Lower Level immediately," Obi-Wan hears his voice answer automatically.

Count Dooku nods once with approval, still watching him. His gaze lays a heavy, palpable weight on Obi-Wan's back like a snake winding around a prey, as he dashes down the corridor toward his speeder.

Descending into the darkness of the Lower Level has never before feels so comforting. Just to know the distance from the choking air up there increases as he flies down.

Obi-Wan breathes more easily and steadily with the artificial wind when he arrives Level Five.

<br>

The street at his arrival is vividly alive.

It is near noon now.

The view shifts so much compared to curfewed nights he can barely remember it's the same place. The walls are still covered with colorful markings and doodles, but with pedestrians dressed in exotic cloth from so many different planets, it's hard to tell apart which colors are stationary on the walls, which ones moving with the local people.

Obi-Wan steps closer to the walls, standing before one, watching it closely.

He doesn't know much about art, or painting, or whatever style this may be called in academia -- abstractionism or something along the line -- he just hopes the observation can give him some answer of where to locate the mysterious number-one-wanted graffiti artist.

The longer he stares, the more sense those characters and patterns seem to be presenting themselves. He thinks he can spot a few repetitive pattern with certain combination of colors and characters. But it could also be coincidences that his mind is just making up theories he wishes to see.

Encryption and decryption isn't his best school work, nor is art. Obi-Wan sighs, taking out his personal hologram, starts taking record of these arts to take back for analysis in the Jedi library computer later.

He doesn't realize the way his feet was taking him leads him to the bar that almost caused that fight with the locals before.

Obi-Wan halts his steps sharply in front of the bar, ready to take a turn. It is at this exact moment, a figure emerges from the exit door, almost bumping right into him.

"I'm sorry," a familiar, young voice says.

Obi-Wan looks up at his face. "It's you."

That reckless, defiant, young boy with blue eyes glares back at him. "You again."
