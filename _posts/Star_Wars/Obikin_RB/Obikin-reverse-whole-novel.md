### Setups

What if, when Anakin was three, he and Shmi were not sold to the Hutts and Watto in Tatooine during slave trade, instead, they were sold to an underground black market art smuggler in Coruscant. Ani started learning/having interest in art by watching/witnessing/helping out those art transactions, Shmi encouraged him to learn painting, it distracted him from slave life. The smuggler died in some art dealer auction conflict shortly and they were let go in chaos (no one cared about them, not realized they're gone). Shmi died shortly after due to some sickness, Anakin grew up alone (with other homeless orphan kids, e.g. Kitster Banai, Wald, Amee) in lower Coruscant, managed to survive on his own in the hard life, did a lot of small outlaw things to support himself, steal/rob/pick up dumpster to get food/money/everything, ran away from police a lot, get into trouble a lot, still try to make art (initially because it comforts him and make him think of mom, later find out more practical usage.)

ep1 timeline, without Ani, Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan didn't go into pod racing bet, didn't get hyperdrive to fix ship, stuck in Tatooine, got caught up by Maul. Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan 2v1 fought Maul, Qui-Gon/Maul died, Padme/Obi-Wan went back to Coruscant in Maul's ship, Palpatine became chancellor. Coruscant was in the corrupted, late Republic stage.

ep2 timeline, Palpatine started clone war, had Jedi and senate all in control. ep3 timeline (current, 19 BBY), Palpatine becomes emperor, all uncooperative Jedi were persecuted or went hiding (e.g. Yoda/Windu disappeared) (=canon Order 66), remaining Jedi mostly get brainwashed/forced to become Palpatine's personal police force. Without Anakin, Dooku is still alive so far, active in conducting Palpatine's orders.

Coruscant the whole city is in strict martial control, has curfew, random arrest for any violation, no free expression, no freedom, reign of terror. Obi-Wan is tasked to clean out lower Coruscant instability sources (Obi-Wan already hesitant about Palpatine and everything but not defiant yet, "not set in stone"). Anakin join/form/lead secret rebel force, starting with childhood friends, advocating rebellion with graffiti art. They run into each other, Obi-Wan notices Anakin's Jedi potential, impressed, starts swaying, chases around, starts to appreciate the art (graffiti actually are code words for assemblies, words/certain color combinations have special meanings, they have a set of secret word, red+some shape=danger, purple/yellow=drop everything and run, blue=safe, green+certain keyword=next meeting time/location and proceed as usual), gets tricked to underground rebellious meeting, given the option of join them and fight against emperor and very likely die, or comply with Jedi brainwash doctrine and fight against rebels, neither know if he'd get harmed by rebels or he'd win and bring Anakin in, which would likely cause Anakin executed by Dooku.

Obi-Wan's decision point, has to choose a side, start with only small help/subtle sign of slipping to their side, e.g. a few times when chasing around he actually already run into Anakin/could have arrested him but deliberately pretend as if missed. slow(/steep?) slip, every decision point actually all chooses Anakin, very clear starting to change side, take more and more interest in Anakin, learn more about him and his past and ideation, the two of them talk more, learn about each other more, start join rebellion meetings (start with only listen at outer rim, not speak), start secretly training Anakin properly, teach him use weapons and Force power. The two become popular among the group, come up with actual real attacking plans, Obi-Wan give them useful suggestion to actually do some real rebel fight against Empire's controlled troops/facilities and win, slowly turn to new leaders people willing to follow.

Obi-Wan meanwhile acts as their double agent in Jedi and near Palpatine. They planned to wait until Anakin is ready to make the final move on Palpatine, but Obi-Wan is already suspected by Palpatine, get confined/tortured/interrogated, very close to be prosecuted (charge of traitorous/treason), know there is info leak (graffiti encoding meaning is leaked, someone from inside might get turned, has rat), know rebels are in danger (Dooku is tasked to kill them all). they all are forced to start the revolution movement earlier than planned, jump-start full-on revolution, Obi-Wan/Anakin in lead. Anakin go into Imperial Palace with the group, has disagreement within team of whether the goal is mainly to rescue Obi-Wan or assassinate Palpatine, Anakin faces the option of either killing Palpatine or saving Obi-Wan, and chooses Obi-Wan, gets himself in danger (run into Dooku, fight, get his right hand cut, like canon).

It turns out Obi-Wan manage to escape on his own (wounded but nonfatal), ready to leave to warn them, come back to rescue Anakin, the two kill Dooku. Obi-Wan uses Force heal to stabilize Anakin's handicapped hand, Anakin furious, desperate, fear can't paint again. Obi-Wan suggests retreat for now, Anakin insists see it through, now or never. The two back-to-back fight together, Anakin is forced to use left hand fighting, non-dominant hand but the move become unexpected, successfully kills Palpatine, they liberate the city, announce empire falls by drawing a huge blue graffiti on wall saying "Free". people want them be new leaders, they suggest building new Republic but need more help, sending out invite to hidden Jedi/senators in all planets, inviting more wise people to reestablish democracy (e.g. look for Yoda, etc.). There are more work need to be done to build the new order, but good thing that they have each other. It's a new beginning for the whole galaxy and for the two of them.

### Claim info

**Optional prompts:** The city was becoming more depressing as the authority stamps out different voices and forms of expression under the rule of Palpatine. However, as Obi-Wan tries to catch up with the notorious graffiti artist the star chaser... he came to appreciate the rebellious side of life...

**Hard No's:** Bottom Obi-Wan, bathroom kinks, unhappy endings, too much violence, other pairings other than present Obikin, non-con

### Summary

What if, when Anakin was three, instead of being sold to the Hutts on Tatooine, he and his mother were sold to an unlawful art dealer in the underground world of Coruscant?

The galaxy is yet again becoming the Galactic Empire under Emperor Palpatine's control, and Jedi -- at least what's left of it, including Obi-Wan -- become the Empire's peace-keeping tools, pursuing the rebellion forces.

That is until Obi-Wan starts learning to appreciate the graffiti arts.

It is a story about hope, rebellion, freedom, creation, and so much more. And of course, how these things change people's lives and the galaxy's fate fundamentally.

### Editing Notes

Both Obi-Wan and Anakin's eyes are blue, so when choose color code: blue = safe

mention Force heal early on when training/showing what Force can do (foreshadowing for Force heal Anakin's cut hand)

mention most of childhood friends early on, include them in later rebel group, represent "people"

To speed up writing Obi-Wan's name, use "obiwan" in the initial writing (start with capital), global auto search-switch once all is finished

## Main

### Chap 1 (Encounter)

> (big environment setups, current timeline: 1y after Order 66 and "First Galactic Empire", 5y after Clone War started)
>
> Coruscant the whole city is in strict martial control, has curfew, random arrest for any violation, no free expression, no freedom, reign of terror. Obi-Wan is tasked to clean out lower Coruscant instability sources (Obi-Wan already hesitant about Palpatine and everything but not defiant yet, "not set in stone").

At seven, all the outdoor screens and holograms are synchronized to the empire broadcast channel, so are the indoor displays in every habitant's house.

It is the same in Coruscant as it is in every planet in the galaxy.

Near the window of his chamber, facing outside, Obi-Wan stands stiffly straight. The view has never stopped looking uneasy, no matter how many times he witnesses. It has been a year, since the announcement of the First Galactic Empire.

The images in the screens and holograms shift at the same time, from an electrical black to the face of Empire Palpatine, smiling kindly at the screen -- as if he's just that same old kind senator from Naboo, recently selected as the chancellor, with the only difference being the title and addressing now becoming "Emperor." Images of his face, large and small, high and low, are displayed on every inch of the screens around the city, his eyes staring at every citizen of the galaxy from all different angles.

Obi-Wan can't help a shiver, and doesn't allow himself to think of why.

He is a Jedi that serves this galaxy, be it republic or empire, his duty remains the same -- for the benefit of the people. And if the empire ensures the peace and prosperity, stops the war, serves people food, then so be it. He would follow the orders and do his job, even if the order now comes from Emperor Palpatine, instead of Jedi Master Counsel, or Senate and Court.

He still turns away from the window when the speech begins. Light shifts outside his window, casting colorful shadows on the opposite wall. He stands in the dark, listening, with his eyes trained on the wall.

The announcement is almost expectable every day -- start with a warm and kind greeting from Emperor Palpatine, talking about how valuable peace and quietness in the city and the galaxy is, after the four-year-long Clone Wars, and the necessity of the Order 66 of removing the traitors to ensure the remaining Jedi are all loyal and serving. The galaxy is not yet in a stable state; there are still rebellions and separatists that are wishing to see the empire breaking apart, see people's lives suffer in wars. And Coruscant as the capitol is undoubtably their first target. That is why the strict martial order is still necessary in the city, the curfew is at eight, any violation to the order will be arrested, any expression that endangers the safety of the empire will be arrested. If, upon investigation, such violation are vindicated guilty, the involved personnel will be executed. Everything is for the safety of the empire and all the lawful citizens living under the empire's protection. Ending with "Enjoy a good night. Long live the Galactic Empire."

The streets are quiet outside. Empty, ghostly quiet. The curfew officially starts at eight, but after a year, people already know well enough to stay inside after the sun down -- Jedi patrol would already start when the speech begins, ensuring no one interfering or jeopardizing the public safety, from Upper Level to Lower Level of the city.

People have also learned well enough to not protest against Jedi patrols or security guards -- not publicly on street anyway. Obi-Wan rubs his temples, missing the old days. People seem to forget they used to be peace keepers, during the republic time. They were respected, looked up to. And now --

He remembers the disgusted looks from people when he walked past them to examine an suspicious-looking bar in the Lower Level, not long ago. The bar turned out legit, with all the complete certifications and registrations. So he walked out with empty hands, ready to report back to the Imperial Palace -- which used to be the Jedi Temple, another thing that he tried not to think too hard every time he steps in or out.

One of the patrons spat at his back: "That's right, run back to your master, you spineless hatchet man, murderer of the freedom."

There were some loud gasping. Then the whole bar fell dead silent. Quiet enough to hear his own heartbeat, and that of every single being.

He turned back slowly, forcing his hand in place, staying by his side, instead of reaching automatically for his lightsaber like all these years of training and his muscle memory demanded.

The voice was young. Merely a boy that did not know any better. There was no need to get into trouble with them. He wasn't even there for them.

Obi-Wan scanned the bar as he turned around. Patrons under his eyes all looked away uneasily, many still having that lingering expression of distaste on their faces, a few glancing at the speaker worriedly. The boy looked barely twenty, tall and slim, in humble clothes that were too short at the end of ankles and wrists, with dirty smudges of paintings layered on top -- typical look of a Lower Level kid, if he was even legit to live in the city.

Obi-Wan regarded him, scrutinizing him with a look that most adults would choose to look away or fidget uneasily. The boy did not. His eyes were sharp, too sharp and accusing for his age -- or maybe kids were just tend to grow faster nowadays, he wouldn't know. He wasn't the first boy Obi-Wan ran into that had that look of defiance in his eyes, and definitely wouldn't be the last, as long as the Empire exists, as long as the creature called "boy" exists.

And they were blue. Obi-Wan remembers himself thinking. Those young eyes, looking into his like the eyes of an eagle born on the cliff and grow on the sea, a look of a wild creature, a trouble-maker.

He swallowed, shifting slightly, keeping his gaze on the boy's forehead instead. "What's your name?" he asked, taking a step forward.

The crowd in the bar stepped back automatically, emptying out a five-feet opening around them.

The boy did not move. He tightened his jaw, lifting his chins. "Who wants to know?"

There was another quiet gasp in the crowd, some worried whisper.

Obi-Wan glanced outside. The daylight was running out fast -- the sky was too far away from the Lower Level to see, it was always dark around here, it was the artificial light simulating the daylight that were turning darker. And the temperature in the air was dropping. Soon, it would be the curfew. He would have to take them into custody according to the new curfew regulation if this farce lasted any longer.

He wouldn't want to get into the trouble of taking all those people to the Custody Center and filing all the paperwork, as much as these people having any interest of going. But right now, with his presence, they weren't even dare to move, let alone leaving the place.

Might as well call it a day and end the whole damn thing quickly. Even if it means let the boy think he won the round, with that satisfied smirk on the tip of his lips.

Obi-Wan sighed. "Jedi Master Kenobi, on official empire duty," he said in a business tone, examining around the crowd again.

Probably the friendliest olive branch they'd ever seen and will ever see from an imperial law enforcer.

"Well, Kenobi," the boy said, aggressively, not caring about using the correct addressing, in a tone far too cold and remote, "Are you going to arrest me, for telling the truth? Are you not working for the empire to destroy the democracy and freedom, and ruin our lives?"

"You should arrest all of us then," another voice in the crowd yelled. He didn't pay attention who, presumably some friends of this kid, exactly as reckless and mindless as he was.

Obi-Wan took another step forward, standing right in front of the boy -- who was about the same height as him, Obi-Wan realized. With this close distance, those dazzling blue eyes were as clean as the distant stars, reflecting his own image.

Obi-Wan looked into his eyes, lowering his voice. "You should be more careful, boy, and show me some respect," he warned him, biting on the word "boy" a little too hard than necessary. "Don't give me a reason to. Next time, I might have to. And you know damn well I will."

He didn't wait for an answer. Casting a quick glance at the surrounding crowd, he told them "As you were," and left the bar.

For days, that pair of blue eyes and the accusations haunted him. Obi-Wan went to the meditation room more frequently than usual, but his mind still refused to quiet.

He stares at the wall in his chamber, and wonders if the boy is also listening to the same message from the Emperor's broadcast somewhere down there in the Lower Level of the city; if he was stupid enough to get himself into trouble with other Jedi patrols or imperial troopers -- he wouldn't be surprised if he did.

There is something else around the boy that bothers him. He can't even tell if it is a disturbance in the Force around him, or just the disturbed mind of himself. The boy is already a trouble just by standing there in the room. For a brief moment, he wished his old Master or other Grand Masters were still here, telling him the answer, guiding him the right way.

Obi-Wan sighs, burying the thoughts. He shouldn't be wondering about those nonsenses, he's just doing his job nowadays. Get assigned new tasks everyday, complete them, go back chamber to rest for a few hours, continue the next day. Sometimes he doesn't know if he has any difference with those security droids anymore. Somewhere in the mind and heart, things are just dulled, feelings numbed.

He straightens his tunic, checks the lightsaber and blaster gun in place, and walks out of the room.

Tonight is his turn of patrol. And he is assigned the Lower Level.

### Chap 2 (Chase)

> Obi-Wan notices graffities for the first time, reports to Emperor, gets tasked to find who the artist is and arrest them, otherwise Dooku will personally come for them 
>
> Obi-Wan runs into Anakin a second time, but doesn't arrest him (excuse: not enough proof)

The Lower Level isn't just one single level, or anything close to just a button on an elevator panel that is placed at the bottom of all the levels.

It's all the places below the ground. All the levels that cannot see the sky. The underground world.

Obi-Wan gets off the speeder, tugging his tunic closer, wrapping himself with his arms under the coat, as if that way he could blend in with local people here -- as if there is any *people* to be blended in.

He examines the empty streets, one level at a time, starting from Level Zero to lower.

No one is on the street.

The world is quiet and dead down here, as is above the ground. The curfew and martial orders have been complied strictly, much to the Emperor's satisfaction.

There are droids and troopers stationed on each level for regular maintenance and surveillance, to handle everyday peace-keeping martial tasks. So as far as Obi-Wan can see, assigning Jedi down here is more or less a waste of effort, unless there is any outburst severe enough that combat skills were to be needed. But if that happened, it might as well be the trigger for another clone war again -- which isn't anything a single Jedi can possible handle -- just between the people and the Empire. Obi-Wan doesn't know if he's ready for anything like that again so soon. The peace under the Empire's choking control is at least, still peace, still a time for some breath.

His mind wanders around as he walks down the street, his eyes scanning around the open spaces on each level, his feeling dissolving into the Force around them.

From Level Zero to Level Four, the lower he reaches, the shabbier and narrower the streets become. The houses are smaller, lower, more broken. Doors and windows are covered with paper and cloth patches, even a wooden plank patch would be a luxury. Barely any street light.

No living creature in sight. It's as if he's just walking around on a detonated, nuclear wasted planet.

Obi-Wan speeds up his steps, not wanting to stay too long in any of these levels.

He goes to the Level Five next.

There is something different about Level Five, he senses it as soon as he steps out of the speeder. The vision, the smell, the rigorousness, a living life form in a dead city. It takes his conscious mind one more second to realize what's the difference.

The street walls are neither barren nor grey. Not the dirty color with occasional red and black smudges that look like nothing other than dried blood. Unlike other Levels.

In here, the walls are unbelievably colorful, with bright colors scattering all over the color spectrum, as if painting palettes for rainbows are poured onto the walls. There are words and sentences too, together with graffities of cartoonized figures, exaggerated creations, images of random creatures, symbols that aren't any known language to his knowledge. The end of brushes are almost always rushed, with visible unclean stroke, as if whoever did this has to finish the thing in a tight time frame.

Obi-Wan walks down the street, staring at those graffities with wide eyes. People are getting bold and reckless down here. That sense of disturbance in the Force is getting stronger the longer he looks at them. He fidgets uneasily as he examines them.

The paints those graffities were using seem normal enough, the cheap kind that one can find anywhere, probably even locally in each level. The content, however, maybe has something worth noticing -- though he can't really understand what they're about for the most parts. They are like doodling, coming out of wild imagination of a five-year-old. It's refreshing in an almost disturbing way.

He doesn't know how to make of it -- so he reports it in, like the new Jedi code the Emperor required.

<br>

The Emperor assembles an emergency meeting the very next day, calling Obi-Wan to report what he saw. Officers and representatives from different areas of expertise are requested. Count Dooku, the Emperor's personal guard stands right behind his throne.

Obi-Wan tries his best to explain those abstract bright lines and curves and patterns, realizing words are too pale to describe, one has to see to know what he's talking about. He finishes awkwardly with that exact suggestion.

Emperor Palpatine asks him to go back to his seat.

A group of representatives of the meeting says it's nothing to worry about, maybe just a kid messing around. Another group says it's a clear and aggressive sign of rebellion against the Empire, anyone involved in it should be arrested and executed immediately. And another asks nonchalantly why that is even a problem.

The Emperor coughs loudly, and starts speaking slowly: "This is a gesture of dissatisfaction from a small group of people, lashing out their childish emotions on public properties. This should not be allowed. Those paintings might increase the doubt in people's mind, affecting the brief peace we have fought so hard to earn and finally have now. I will add the new regulation in tonight's announcements to prohibit such behavior."

Therefore by night, when the new and old regulations are being broadcast, Obi-Wan isn't exactly surprised to find out a newly added regulation, but hearing the exact words still makes his heart twist in discomfort. The new regulation says: "Any and all, public or private, display of all formats, regarding personal expression unaligned with the Empire Value is illegal, including but not limited to street art, street painting, street performance. Therefore, certain behaviors like graffiti are strictly forbidden, and anyone who conducted this illegal behavior will be held legal responsibility, arrested and personally investigated by The Emperor and the highest security team."

By "highest security team," he undoubtedly means Count Dooku himself.

Obi-Wan chokes on the water he's drinking, feeling a sick wrench at the lower of his stomach, as if he's both punched there hard and going to vomit at the same time.

He rushes toward the door of his chamber.

And runs right into Count Dooku.

Obi-Wan halts harshly, holding on the door to steady himself, more startled than surprised. "Count Dooku," he greets, trying his best to keep his voice and breath stable.

Count Dooku eyes him, "Jedi master Kenobi, so good to see you. The Emperor has an assignment for you. We have reason to believe those graffities are signs where a new rebellion force is forming, endangering the peace and stability of the Empire. You are tasked to find those dangerous rebellion sources, and take them to the Emperor. If you fail, *I* will go to the Lower Level myself. Do you understand?"

"Yes, perfectly clear. I will be on my way to the Lower Level immediately," Obi-Wan hears his voice answer automatically.

Count Dooku nods once with approval, still watching him. His gaze lays a heavy, palpable weight on Obi-Wan's back like a snake winding around a prey, as he dashes down the corridor toward his speeder.

Descending into the darkness of the Lower Level has never before feels so comforting. Just knowing the distance from the choking air up there increases as he flies down makes his clenched heart uncoiling -- even just the slightest. He still doesn't know what exactly he'd be running into down there, and what he'd do if he finds those people.

Obi-Wan breathes more easily and steadily with the artificial wind when he arrives at Level Five.

<br>

The night doesn't give him enough information -- at least that's the reason he gives himself -- so Obi-Wan thinks he might as well wait until the day time to continue his investigation.

He drifts across the streets like a living ghost.

The street comes to life when the morning comes.

The view shifts so much from the curfewed dark night that he can barely recognize it is still the same place. The colorful markings and doodles on the walls are almost like real, living lives, waking up in the brighter day night, yawning and gazing at the pedestrians. And look at those pedestrians! Most of them dress in exotic cloth from so many different alien culture, it's hard to tell apart which colors are stationary on the walls, which ones moving with the local people. Obi-Wan feels as if he's fording in the pond of color when he walks through the streets.

He steps closer to the walls, standing before the one near one end of the street, watching it closely.

He doesn't know much about art, or painting, or whatever style this may be called in academia -- abstractionism or something along the line -- he just hopes the observation can give him some answer of where to locate the mysterious now-number-one-wanted graffiti artist.

The longer he stares, the more senses those characters and patterns seem to be presenting themselves. He thinks he can spot a few repetitive pattern with certain combination of colors and characters. But it could also be coincidences that his mind is just making up theories he wishes to see.

Encryption and decryption isn't his best school work, nor is art. Obi-Wan sighs, taking out his personal handheld datapad, starts taking record of these arts to take back for analysis in the Jedi library computer later.

He doesn't realize the way his feet was taking him along the painted wall that leads toward the end of the alley, where the bar that almost caused him that fight with the locals located, until he's already at its door.

The last graffiti ends outside the bar.

Obi-Wan halts his steps sharply in front of the bar, ready to take a turn. It is at this exact moment, a figure emerges from the exit door, almost bumping right into him.

"Excuse me," a familiar, young voice says.

Obi-Wan looks up, running into a pair of recognizable eyes. "It's you."

That reckless, defiant, young boy with blue eyes glares back at him. His eyes narrow with recognition, "You again, Jedi."

"Jedi Master Kenobi," Obi-Wan can't help correcting him.

"I remember," the boy smirks, looking right back at him, the same way he did last time. His cloth is even dirtier than last time -- no, not "dirty," more colorful. More paints with the same set of bright colors on those walls has left marks and smudges on his thin shirt and cheap hooded jacket with the same color as his eyes. In his hands, he's holding a handful of spray cans.

Obi-Wan's heart sinks when his eyes land on those. Yet somehow, he thinks he already knows it even before running into the boy again.

The boy follows his gaze and sees where his attention gets attracted to. He shifts his arms so the cans are half hidden behind his body.

"I see you're interested in arts," Obi-Wan comments cautiously, glancing at the painted walls beside them. "Did you not hear the latest regulation announced last night? The street arts and graffities are strictly forbidden now."

The boy quirks a smirking smile, "I wonder who did those arts, I'll make sure to let them know not to do that again." The silent challenge is more than loud enough for Obi-Wan to hear in his undertones: *You don't have proof it's me. That's why you're just standing here staring at me, waiting for me to give up evidence, aren't you? Think again, I'm not stupid. So what are you going to do, Kenobi?*

And that is exactly why Obi-Wan can't take him in now -- he'll need more proof than the cans to call the boy suspicious or guilty. He'll have to catch him in action or something of the kind.

Obi-Wan can do nothing but glare at him.

Another voice calls across the street: "Ani, you coming or not?"

The boy's head jerks to the source of the voice. "In a minute," he yells back.

Obi-Wan raises his eyebrows in a joyful beam. "So it's Ani."

"It's 'Anakin' to you," the boy snaps. "'Ani' is only for my friends."

"Alright, Anakin," Obi-Wan says compliantly, voice softer, glancing at the spray cans in his hands again. "Just so you know, whoever is painting those, I'll have to arrest them if I find them."

Anakin shrugs carelessly. "Then I'll make sure they are never found." He turns to catch up with his friends.

Obi-Wan watches his back with a lump in his throat.

He goes back to study the paintings for the rest of the day, and he doesn't run into Anakin for another three days.

Obi-Wan: "not set in stone"

Obi-Wan is tasked to clean out lower Coruscant instability sources

### Chap 3 (Trick)

> Obi-Wan runs into Anakin again. Anakin join/form/lead secret rebel force, starting with childhood friends, advocating rebellion with graffiti art. Obi-Wan notices Anakin's Jedi potential, impressed, starts swaying, chases around, starts to appreciate the art (graffiti actually are code words for assemblies, words/certain color combinations have special meanings, they have a set of secret word, red+skeleton=danger; purple/yellow+snake pattern=drop everything and run, the more poisonous the snake, the bigger the danger; blue+dove=safe, green+certain keyword/beard=next meeting time/location and proceed as usual), gets tricked to underground rebellious meeting (Obi-Wan thinks he starts able to decode the message, but actually they purposefully leave the hint)

Obi-Wan ends up not sending the images of the graffities to the Jedi library for analysis. He chooses to sit down before the painted walls, and starts studying them on his own. He can't explain why he's doing all that.

He doesn't even go back to the Upper Level for his daily check-in reports. Merely sending in messages to say he's in the undercover task, he'll be in touch when convenient.

The Emperor seems pleased that he's been spending all his time down here, but he suspects Count Dooku might not be so patient, from the replies he received. He doesn't have much time -- either to figure out what's happening in the Lower Level and fix the situation by himself, or probably have to watch someone else to come down here fixing it for him, which includes fixing *him*.

Obi-Wan takes a long breath, pulling his thought back to the graffiti arts. He thinks he's getting closer.

The art is very expressional and artistic, to say the least. But now he's also fairly certain they're also equally informational. The Emperor's suspicion on it being a sign of rebellion's existence might not be entirely unreasonable.

There are certain color and word combinations that've been repeatedly spotted from different part of the streets, followed closely by a different set of color and unrecognizable characters, usually in green and blue. And if the leading combination is in red and has a skeleton or skull somewhere around, no matter how small they are, then no more mysterious characters.

Obi-Wan thinks he's starting to get the whole language system in the art, if only he can find a decoder ring to fill in the remaining gap.

And the opportunity presents itself quicker than he knows. Like a blessing that his prayer is answered.

<br>

On the third day after he knows Anakin's name, he runs into the boy again. And this time, he catches him right on the crime scene.

Obi-Wan is examining a back alley where a new set of painting has been freshly added. Judging by the undried paint, he'd guess whoever did this -- even if he knows it must be Anakin, he's still leaving the space for reasonable doubt -- they can't be far. Those new graffities are at most two hours old, the tail of the stroke is rushed in smudged blue.

He follows the only way where that alley leads, and sees Anakin busy working on a new pattern just a block away. He holds a spray can and the paint lands on the wall with a curve.

Obi-Wan dashes toward him quietly, but Anakin already senses his approach like a cat hearing human's footsteps.

The boy seems surprised to see him there, but as soon as his eyes land on Obi-Wan, there is a small mischievous twitch on his lips. From the distance, Obi-Wan can't tell if it's a smirk or panicked gasp. The kid doesn't bother collecting the cans at the foot of the wall, just turning to the tail of the alley and running.

Obi-Wan picks up his pace to follow him closely.

But the Lower Level, if nothing else, is *the* most perfect place for hide-and-seek. And Anakin has clearly spent enough time here to know all the small turns and hideouts and hidden doors, and he's certainly not hesitant to utilize those knowledge. He slips through them nimbly like rabbit in the field.

Within five minutes, Obi-Wan finds himself in the middle of a residential area, surrounded by houses with closed windows and doors. Anakin could have been hidden in any one of them, or he might already escape to the other end of this Level, maybe even to a different Level, if he wants. Obi-Wan would have to knock on every door to be sure, and if that comes out with empty hands, he might as well dig the whole Level's ground to be able to find him again.

Obi-Wan goes back the way he comes.

Even those scattered cans at the foot of the wall have been taken. Anakin must have come back when he manages to get rid of Obi-Wan's trail. The boy is good, Obi-Wan has to give him that.

He studies the new graffiti instead. The pattern that he remembers seeing blue is now covered by a red skeleton. A strong stroke of purple mixed with some dark yellow crosses out something that was probably green down there, the letters of the unknown language is now completely indistinct.

Looks exactly like a warning notice and something like an evacuation order that cancelled a previously scheduled assembly because something dangerous has happened. *OH --* Obi-Wan realizes suddenly. Something dangerous like a Jedi has been in sight. *Him.*

They have a communication system to warn about his route, that must be why it's been so difficult to even spot a foot track of Anakin. Or anyone else he might be working with. And if they have been going through all these trouble just to hide something from him, then there must be something utterly serious that needs ultimate secrecy. Something bigger than just some graffiti art.

The Emperor's suspicion of a rebel force might just be on the right track.

If only he could be sure.

Obi-Wan glances down at the ground, looking for more leads.

And there, on the ground, among dirty paper tissues stained with sprays, cigarette butts, and other trashes, are scattered, torn scraps of a paper. Looks exactly like any other trash, and easily mistaken as just a normal piece of random trash, but the same kind of disturbance when he senses around Anakin also surrounds them, as if they're calling for him.

Obi-Wan spends about an hour picking up every small piece of the scraps he can find and puts them back together. The tears are random and careless, making it probably the worse puzzle game in the world, but not impossible to recover. Not for him, at least.

And lucky for him, the words on the paper are not ruined by the tears. What he finds on there, however, makes his eyes widened.

In scratchy and barely legible writing, it's the exact translation guidance he wishes to find, about the meanings of the symbols on the wall.

Not all of them, it seems, when he cross-compares the symbols in front of him with the patterns on the paper. And there are still gaps in the paper where the scrapes must have been blown away by the wind. But enough to make sense and understand the crucial message.

The red skeleton and skull is a warning sign, just as he concluded. The combination of purple and that certain dark yellow snaky pattern means "drop everything and run." That greenish blue means safe, and there is a specific symbol for each of about a dozen locations and each hour of the day. With a certain combination, one can know exactly when and where -- for a next meeting, undoubtedly.

"You really think tearing it up would be enough to hide from a Jedi, Anakin? You shouldn't underestimate me," Obi-Wan murmurs to the paper, feeling it's a little too easy. He wonders if it's because this time he was already too close to catching him, and the boy had to run in a fluster escape.

He takes out his personal datapad to take a photo of the pieced-together paper, and ignites the original with his lightsaber. Obi-Wan only thinks back why he did it until after all the paper pieces became burned, black ashes. And he doesn't have a good answer. *Just for safety.* He tells himself. But even he knows it sounds a little lame.

He decidedly steers his mind away and starts looking for their next assembly plan.

He does not report this latest breakthrough finding, either. He tells himself he'd report once he's found something more solid. He doesn't have enough proof yet.

The only proof that turned into the ash flies in the air when a breeze comes by. They're scattered farther, and then gone without a trace.

<br>

Their next assembly will be in the basement of a deserted factory, three hours before the curfew on a Friday afternoon.

Obi-Wan finds the latest piece of graffiti with the announcement another two days later, and thanks to the decoder sheet, he reads it like looking into words written in plain common language. And with bright colors and powerful strokes, the art is practically shouting "Freedom" and "Rebel" at his face, along with some really strong words regarding the Empire. If the Upper Level ever finds out the true meaning of these arts, anyone involved would get electrocuted. No question asked.

Obi-Wan frowned at them when he saw them, eyebrows deeply furrowed. He can't feel more glad that at least among everyone from security and guarding forces, *he* is the one tasked for this and finding out what they're plotting. He can't imagine what kind of massacre it would turn into, if Count Dooku ever comes down here and finds what he found. It gives him a shiver when he imagines the colorful walls are splattered with dark bloody red.

The back door of that deserted factory is loosely opened with a slit when he arrives, an hour before the assembly starts. He sneaks in easily without a sound. The rusty door looks as if it's going to moan when he passes it, but he wills it to be quiet, and god-blessingly it complies.

The place is dim and shabby, much like all the constructions in this Level nowadays. But in the middle of the ground, there is a big enough opening for people to gather. Perhaps to have some treacherous discussions, if he has to guess, maybe even some bold movement against the Empire -- for which he can snuff out the bud of an rebellion against the Empire now that he's here. Obi-Wan figures, hiding behind a corner behind a broken column, waiting patiently for the assembly to start.

An hour passes.

And then the second hour.

The space is getting darker as it comes closer to the night time. The only light comes in through a dirty window high on the wall, near the edge of the ceiling.

Only when Obi-Wan starts doubting if he's really translating those patterns correctly, or the sheet is lying, people start walking in.

But instead of hearing a radical, reactionary, bolshy assembly as he expected, those people start talking about the tough lives civilians were living nowadays under the Empire's military control, the suffocating atmosphere that stifles any creative expressions, the assistance each one of them can provide for one another, and most of all, how they can make people's life better.

They are kind, and friendly, and calm. Only when they talk about their neighbors' starved kids or sick elderlies do they sound emotional, sobbing quietly in unshed tears.

Obi-Wan swallows hard as he listens.

*These are just people.* He thinks, astonished and uncharacteristically upset, behind the column, in the shadow he hides, just like the shadow those people are used to live in. These are just ordinary people trying so hard to have a life, and the Empire is squeezing their living space, suffocating them mentally and physically.

He doesn't realize since when has he started clenching his fist or biting on his teeth, or what's that for. He forces his fists and jaws to relax, and continues listening. He's still a Jedi for this galaxy, after all. Surely maintaining a peaceful galaxy is more important than one poor kid or one old man. His job tonight is still to follow the order and arrest the dangerous rebel forces, led by none other then the familiar one who has a young voice and a familiar slim figure.

Obi-Wan stares at the boy -- a young man actually, he looks more like a leader now, standing before the group, soothing them with soft voice, giving them instructions of how to fix some of the difficulties -- how to fix a tool that's broken, who to ask for medical advices, what to do to release a pain, what they're short of and where they might find, and many more. Anakin is still in his art-smudged hooded jacket, but the whole vibe radiating from him seems so different -- less of a dreamy naughty artist, but a responsible leader that actually cares about people, helps people. Except, undoubtedly, evidently, he *is* a rebellion force now, from the Empire's perspective, gathering secret assemblies, encouraging the complaints toward the Empire, disassembling the hard-earned peace the Empire is trying to maintain. There is no defense for that.

Obi-Wan takes a candid photo from his hidden position, bites his lips, and goes back to continue staring at the scene. *Does he really have to take him in? But he doesn't seem to have a choice, does he? The order is quiet clear, so is the consequence.* He remembers Count Dooku's figure, swaying before his eyes like a shadow, with a quiet but menacing tone: "If you fail, *I* will go to the Lower Level myself. Do you understand?"

His hands are clenched into fists with white knuckles again.

He's so focused in his thoughts now he almost doesn't realize since when the conversation and the assembly has stopped. People's talking voice die down like waning sea waves, but they're oddly not leaving yet.

Obi-Wan wonders what their next move is going to be, when the young voice echoes in the space, loud and clear: "How long are you planning on staying there, Jedi Master Kenobi?"

#### draft notes

**flashback casual mention introduce past events:** ep2 timeline, Palpatine started clone war, had Jedi and senate all in control. ep3 timeline (current, 19 BBY), Palpatine becomes emperor, all uncooperative Jedi were persecuted or went hiding (e.g. Yoda/Windu disappeared) (=canon Order 66), remaining Jedi mostly get brainwashed/forced to become Palpatine's personal police force. Without Anakin, Dooku is still alive so far, active in conducting Palpatine's orders.

Anakin join/form/lead secret rebel force, starting with childhood friends (e.g. Kitster Banai, Wald, Amee), advocating rebellion with graffiti art

### Chap 4 (Choice)

> Obi-Wan knows about rebel force, is given the option of join them and fight against emperor and very likely die, or comply with Jedi brainwash doctrine and fight against rebels, neither know if he'd get harmed by rebels or he'd win and bring Anakin in, which would likely cause Anakin executed by Dooku.
>
> Obi-Wan's decision point, has to choose a side. He chooses them, is let go. start with only small help/subtle sign of slipping to their side, e.g. a few times when chasing around he actually already run into Anakin/could have arrested him but deliberately pretend as if missed. slow(/steep?) slip, every decision point actually all chooses Anakin, very clear starting to change side

some talk about trust issue, Anakin trusts his intuition, trusts Obi-Wan

after Obi-Wan actually changes his side, the addressing changes to, either he self-intro as or Anakin starts calling him Obi-Wan

### Chap 5 (Attraction)

> Obi-Wan takes more and more interest in Anakin, learn more about him and his past and ideation (Anakin talk about his childhood and why his interest in art), the two of them talk more, learn about each other more, start join rebellion meetings (start with only listen at outer rim, not speak), start secretly training Anakin properly, teach him use weapons and Force power.

<br>

#### draft notes

Obi-Wan shows him Force can heal

Anakin's childhood flashback and Obi-Wan's flashback of losing Qui-Gon, both see more below in setups session

### Chap 6 (Grow/Slow burn)

> The two become popular among the group, come up with actual real attacking plans, Obi-Wan give them useful suggestion to actually do some real rebel fight against Empire's controlled troops/facilities (use graffiti as cover/breach/signal) and win, slowly turn to new leaders people willing to follow.
>
> Obi-Wan meanwhile acts as their double agent in Jedi and near Palpatine. They planned to wait until Anakin is ready to make the final move on Palpatine, but Obi-Wan is already suspected by Palpatine

<br>

### Chap 7 (Revolution)

> Obi-Wan gets captured/tortured/interrogated, very close to be prosecuted (charge of traitorous/treason), know there is info leak (graffiti encoding meaning is leaked, someone from inside might get turned, has rat), know rebels are in danger (Dooku is tasked to kill them all).
>
> They all are forced to start the revolution movement earlier than planned, jump-start full-on revolution, Obi-Wan/Anakin in lead.
>
> Anakin go into Imperial Palace with the group, has disagreement within team of whether the goal is mainly to rescue Obi-Wan or assassinate Palpatine, Anakin faces the option of either killing Palpatine or saving Obi-Wan, and chooses Obi-Wan, gets himself in danger (run into Dooku, fight, get his right hand cut, like canon).

<br>

### Chap 8 (Mutual Rescue)

> It turns out Obi-Wan manage to escape on his own (wounded but nonfatal), ready to leave to warn them, come back to rescue Anakin, the two kill Dooku. Obi-Wan uses Force heal to stabilize Anakin's handicapped hand, Anakin furious, desperate, fear can't paint again. Obi-Wan suggests retreat for now, Anakin insists see it through, now or never.

<br>

### Chap 9 (Success)

> The two back-to-back fight together, Anakin is forced to use left hand fighting, non-dominant hand but the move become unexpected, successfully kills Palpatine, they liberate the city, announce empire falls by drawing a huge blue graffiti on wall saying "Free". people want them be new leaders, they suggest building new Republic but need more help, sending out invite to hidden Jedi/senators in all plantes, inviting more wise people to reestablish democracy (e.g. look for Yoda, etc.). There are more work need to be done to build the new order, but good thing that they have each other.
