### Setups

What if, when Anakin was three, he and Shmi were not sold to the Hutts and Watto in Tatooine during slave trade, instead, they were sold to an underground black market art smuggler in Coruscant. Ani started learning/having interest in art by watching/witnessing/helping out those art transactions, Shmi encouraged him to learn painting, it distracted him from slave life. The smuggler died in some art dealer auction conflict shortly and they were let go in chaos (no one cared about them, not realized they're gone). Shmi died shortly after due to some sickness, Anakin grew up alone (with other homeless orphan kids, e.g. Kitster Banai, Wald, Amee) in lower Coruscant, managed to survive on his own in the hard life, did a lot of small outlaw things to support himself, steal/rob/pick up dumpster to get food/money/everything, ran away from police a lot, get into trouble a lot, still try to make art (initially because it comforts him and make him think of mom, later find out more practical usage.)

ep1 timeline, without Ani, Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan didn't go into pod racing bet, didn't get hyperdrive to fix ship, stuck in Tatooine, got caught up by Maul. Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan 2v1 fought Maul, Qui-Gon/Maul died, Padme/Obi-Wan went back to Coruscant in Maul's ship, Palpatine became chancellor. Coruscant was in the corrupted, late Republic stage.

ep2 timeline, Palpatine started clone war, had Jedi and senate all in control. ep3 timeline (current, 19 BBY), Palpatine becomes emperor, all uncooperative Jedi were persecuted or went hiding (e.g. Yoda/Windu disappeared) (=canon Order 66), remaining Jedi mostly get brainwashed/forced to become Palpatine's personal police force. Without Anakin, Dooku is still alive so far, active in conducting Palpatine's orders.

Coruscant the whole city is in strict martial control, has curfew, random arrest for any violation, no free expression, no freedom, reign of terror. Obi-Wan is tasked to clean out lower Coruscant instability sources (Obi-Wan already hesitant about Palpatine and everything but not defiant yet, "not set in stone"). Anakin join/form/lead secret rebel force, starting with childhood friends, advocating rebellion with graffiti art. They run into each other, Obi-Wan notices Anakin's Jedi potential, impressed, starts swaying, chases around, starts to appreciate the art (graffiti actually are code words for assemblies, words/certain color combinations have special meanings, they have a set of secret word, red+some shape=danger, purple/yellow=drop everything and run, blue=safe, green+certain keyword=next meeting time/location and proceed as usual), gets tricked to underground rebellious meeting, given the option of join them and fight against emperor and very likely die, or comply with Jedi brainwash doctrine and fight against rebels, neither know if he'd get harmed by rebels or he'd win and bring Anakin in, which would likely cause Anakin executed by Dooku.

Obi-Wan's decision point, has to choose a side, start with only small help/subtle sign of slipping to their side, e.g. a few times when chasing around he actually already run into Anakin/could have arrested him but deliberately pretend as if missed. slow(/steep?) slip, every decision point actually all chooses Anakin, very clear starting to change side, take more and more interest in Anakin, learn more about him and his past and ideation, the two of them talk more, learn about each other more, start join rebellion meetings (start with only listen at outer rim, not speak), start secretly training Anakin properly, teach him use weapons and Force power. The two become popular among the group, come up with actual real attacking plans, Obi-Wan give them useful suggestion to actually do some real rebel fight against Empire's controlled troops/facilities and win, slowly turn to new leaders people willing to follow.

Obi-Wan meanwhile acts as their double agent in Jedi and near Palpatine. They planned to wait until Anakin is ready to make the final move on Palpatine, but Obi-Wan is already suspected by Palpatine, get confined/tortured/interrogated, very close to be prosecuted (charge of traitorous/treason), know there is info leak (graffiti encoding meaning is leaked, someone from inside might get turned, has rat), know rebels are in danger (Dooku is tasked to kill them all). they all are forced to start the revolution movement earlier than planned, jump-start full-on revolution, Obi-Wan/Anakin in lead. Anakin go into Imperial Palace with the group, has disagreement within team of whether the goal is mainly to rescue Obi-Wan or assassinate Palpatine, Anakin faces the option of either killing Palpatine or saving Obi-Wan, and chooses Obi-Wan, gets himself in danger (run into Dooku, fight, get his right hand cut, like canon).

It turns out Obi-Wan manage to escape on his own (wounded but nonfatal), ready to leave to warn them, come back to rescue Anakin, the two kill Dooku. Obi-Wan uses Force heal to stabilize Anakin's handicapped hand, Anakin furious, desperate, fear can't paint again. Obi-Wan suggests retreat for now, Anakin insists see it through, now or never. The two back-to-back fight together, Anakin is forced to use left hand fighting, non-dominant hand but the move become unexpected, successfully kills Palpatine, they liberate the city, announce empire falls by drawing a huge blue graffiti on wall saying "Free". people want them be new leaders, they suggest building new Republic but need more help, sending out invite to hidden Jedi/senators in all planets, inviting more wise people to reestablish democracy (e.g. look for Yoda, etc.). There are more work need to be done to build the new order, but good thing that they have each other. It's a new beginning for the whole galaxy and for the two of them.

### Claim info

**Optional prompts:** The city was becoming more depressing as the authority stamps out different voices and forms of expression under the rule of Palpatine. However, as Obi-Wan tries to catch up with the notorious graffiti artist the star chaser... he came to appreciate the rebellious side of life...

**Hard No's:** Bottom Obi-Wan, bathroom kinks, unhappy endings, too much violence, other pairings other than present Obikin, non-con

### Summary

What if, when Anakin was three, instead of being sold to the Hutts on Tatooine, he and his mother were sold to an unlawful art dealer in the underground world of Coruscant?

The galaxy is yet again becoming the Galactic Empire under Emperor Palpatine's control, and Jedi -- at least what's left of it, including Obi-Wan -- become the Empire's peace-keeping tools, pursuing the rebellion forces.

That is until Obi-Wan starts learning to appreciate the graffiti arts.

It is a story about hope, rebellion, freedom, creation, and so much more. And of course, how these things change people's lives and the galaxy's fate fundamentally.

### Editing Notes

Both Obi-Wan and Anakin's eyes are blue, so when choose color code: blue = safe

mention Force heal early on when training/showing what Force can do (foreshadowing for Force heal Anakin's cut hand)

mention most of childhood friends early on, include them in later rebel group, represent "people"

To speed up writing Obi-Wan's name, use "obiwan" in the initial writing (start with capital), global auto search-switch once all is finished

## Main

### Chap 1 (Encounter)

> (big environment setups, current timeline: 1y after Order 66 and "First Galactic Empire", 5y after Clone War started)
>
> Coruscant the whole city is in strict martial control, has curfew, random arrest for any violation, no free expression, no freedom, reign of terror. Obi-Wan is tasked to clean out lower Coruscant instability sources (Obi-Wan already hesitant about Palpatine and everything but not defiant yet, "not set in stone").

At seven, all the outdoor screens and holograms are synchronized to the empire broadcast channel, so are the indoor displays in every habitant's house.

It is the same in Coruscant as it is in every planet in the galaxy.

Near the window of his chamber, facing outside, Obi-Wan stands stiffly straight. The view has never stopped looking uneasy, no matter how many times he witnesses. It has been a year, since the announcement of the First Galactic Empire.

The images in the screens and holograms shift at the same time, from an electrical black to the face of Empire Palpatine, smiling kindly at the screen -- as if he's just that same old kind senator from Naboo, recently selected as the chancellor, with the only difference being the title and addressing now becoming "Emperor." Images of his face, large and small, high and low, are displayed on every inch of the screens around the city, his eyes staring at every citizen of the galaxy from all different angles.

Obi-Wan can't help a shiver, and doesn't allow himself to think of why.

He is a Jedi that serves this galaxy, be it republic or empire, his duty remains the same -- for the benefit of the people. And if the empire ensures the peace and prosperity, stops the war, serves people food, then so be it. He would follow the orders and do his job, even if the order now comes from Emperor Palpatine, instead of Jedi Master Counsel, or Senate and Court.

He still turns away from the window when the speech begins. Light shifts outside his window, casting colorful shadows on the opposite wall. He stands in the dark, listening, with his eyes trained on the wall.

The announcement is almost expectable every day -- start with a warm and kind greeting from Emperor Palpatine, talking about how valuable peace and quietness in the city and the galaxy is, after the three-year-long Clone Wars, and the necessity of the Order 66 of removing the traitors to ensure the remaining Jedi are all loyal and serving. The galaxy is not yet in a stable state; there are still rebellions and separatists that are wishing to see the empire breaking apart, see people's lives suffer in wars. And Coruscant as the capitol is undoubtably their first target. That is why the strict martial order is still necessary in the city, the curfew is at eight, any violation to the order will be arrested, any expression that endangers the safety of the empire will be arrested. If, upon investigation, such violation are vindicated guilty, the involved personnel will be executed. Everything is for the safety of the empire and all the lawful citizens living under the empire's protection. Ending with "Enjoy a good night. Long live the Galactic Empire."

The streets are quiet outside. Empty, ghostly quiet. The curfew officially starts at eight, but after a year, people already know well enough to stay inside after the sun down -- Jedi patrol would already start when the speech begins, ensuring no one interfering or jeopardizing the public safety, from Upper Level to Lower Level of the city.

People have also learned well enough to not protest against Jedi patrols or security guards -- not publicly on street anyway. Obi-Wan rubs his temples, missing the old days. People seem to forget they used to be peace keepers, during the republic time. They were respected, looked up to. And now --

He remembers the disgusted looks from people when he walked past them to examine an suspicious-looking bar in the Lower Level, not long ago. The bar turned out legit, with all the complete certifications and registrations. So he walked out with empty hands, ready to report back to the Imperial Palace -- which used to be the Jedi Temple, another thing that he tried not to think too hard every time he steps in or out.

One of the patrons spat at his back: "That's right, run back to your master, you spineless hatchet man, murderer of the freedom."

There were some loud gasping. Then the whole bar fell dead silent. Quiet enough to hear his own heartbeat, and that of every single being.

He turned back slowly, forcing his hand in place, staying by his side, instead of reaching automatically for his lightsaber like all these years of training and his muscle memory demanded.

The voice was young. Merely a boy that did not know any better. There was no need to get into trouble with them. He wasn't even there for them.

Obi-Wan scanned the bar as he turned around. Patrons under his eyes all looked away uneasily, many still having that lingering expression of distaste on their faces, a few glancing at the speaker worriedly. The boy looked barely twenty, tall and slim, in humble clothes that were too short at the end of ankles and wrists, with dirty smudges of paintings layered on top -- typical look of a Lower Level kid, if he was even legit to live in the city.

Obi-Wan regarded him, scrutinizing him with a look that most adults would choose to look away or fidget uneasily. The boy did not. His eyes were sharp, too sharp and accusing for his age -- or maybe kids were just tend to grow faster nowadays, he wouldn't know. He wasn't the first boy Obi-Wan ran into that had that look of defiance in his eyes, and definitely wouldn't be the last, as long as the Empire exists, as long as the creature called "boy" exists.

And they were blue. Obi-Wan remembers himself thinking. Those young eyes, looking into his like the eyes of an eagle born on the cliff and grow on the sea, a look of a wild creature, a trouble-maker.

He swallowed, shifting slightly, keeping his gaze on the boy's forehead instead. "What's your name?" he asked, taking a step forward.

The crowd in the bar stepped back automatically, emptying out a five-feet opening around them.

The boy did not move. He tightened his jaw, lifting his chins. "Who wants to know?"

There was another quiet gasp in the crowd, some worried whisper.

Obi-Wan glanced outside. The daylight was running out fast -- the sky was too far away from the Lower Level to see, it was always dark around here, it was the artificial light simulating the daylight that were turning darker. And the temperature in the air was dropping. Soon, it would be the curfew. He would have to take them into custody according to the new curfew regulation if this farce lasted any longer.

He wouldn't want to get into the trouble of taking all those people to the Custody Center and filing all the paperwork, as much as these people having any interest of going. But right now, with his presence, they weren't even dare to move, let alone leaving the place.

Might as well call it a day and end the whole damn thing quickly. Even if it means let the boy think he won the round, with that satisfied smirk on the tip of his lips.

Obi-Wan sighed. "Jedi Master Kenobi, on official empire duty," he said in a business tone, examining around the crowd again.

Probably the friendliest olive branch they'd ever seen and will ever see from an imperial law enforcer.

"Well, Kenobi," the boy said, aggressively, not caring about using the correct addressing, in a tone far too cold and remote, "Are you going to arrest me, for telling the truth? Are you not working for the empire to destroy the democracy and freedom, and ruin our lives?"

"You should arrest all of us then," another voice in the crowd yelled. He didn't pay attention who, presumably some friends of this kid, exactly as reckless and mindless as he was.

Obi-Wan took another step forward, standing right in front of the boy -- who was about the same height as him, Obi-Wan realized. With this close distance, those dazzling blue eyes were as clean as the distant stars, reflecting his own image.

Obi-Wan looked into his eyes, lowering his voice. "You should be more careful, boy, and show me some respect," he warned him, biting on the word "boy" a little too hard than necessary. "Don't give me a reason to. Next time, I might have to. And you know damn well I will."

He didn't wait for an answer. Casting a quick glance at the surrounding crowd, he told them "As you were," and left the bar.

For days, that pair of blue eyes and the accusations haunted him. Obi-Wan went to the meditation room more frequently than usual, but his mind still refused to quiet.

He stares at the wall in his chamber, and wonders if the boy is also listening to the same message from the Emperor's broadcast somewhere down there in the Lower Level of the city; if he was stupid enough to get himself into trouble with other Jedi patrols or imperial troopers -- he wouldn't be surprised if he did.

There is something else around the boy that bothers him. He can't even tell if it is a disturbance in the Force around him, or just the disturbed mind of himself. The boy is already a trouble just by standing there in the room. For a brief moment, he wished his old Master or other Grand Masters were still here, telling him the answer, guiding him the right way.

Obi-Wan sighs, burying the thoughts. He shouldn't be wondering about those nonsenses, he's just doing his job nowadays. Get assigned new tasks everyday, complete them, go back chamber to rest for a few hours, continue the next day. Sometimes he doesn't know if he has any difference with those security droids anymore. Somewhere in the mind and heart, things are just dulled, feelings numbed.

He straightens his tunic, checks the lightsaber and blaster gun in place, and walks out of the room.

Tonight is his turn of patrol. And he is assigned the Lower Level.

### Chap 2 (Chase)

> Obi-Wan notices graffities for the first time, reports to Emperor, gets tasked to find who the artist is and arrest them, otherwise Dooku will personally come for them 
>
> Obi-Wan runs into Anakin a second time, but doesn't arrest him (excuse: not enough proof)

The Lower Level isn't just one single level, or anything close to just a button on an elevator panel that is placed at the bottom of all the levels.

It's all the places below the ground. All the levels that cannot see the sky. The underground world.

Obi-Wan gets off the speeder, tugging his tunic closer, wrapping himself with his arms under the coat, as if that way he could blend in with local people here -- as if there is any *people* to be blended in.

He examines the empty streets, one level at a time, starting from Level Zero to lower.

No one is on the street.

The world is quiet and dead down here, as is above the ground. The curfew and martial orders have been complied strictly, much to the Emperor's satisfaction.

There are droids and troopers stationed on each level for regular maintenance and surveillance, to handle everyday peace-keeping martial tasks. So as far as Obi-Wan can see, assigning Jedi down here is more or less a waste of effort, unless there is any outburst severe enough that combat skills were to be needed. But if that happened, it might as well be the trigger for another clone war again -- which isn't anything a single Jedi can possible handle -- just between the people and the Empire. Obi-Wan doesn't know if he's ready for anything like that again so soon. The peace under the Empire's choking control is at least, still peace, still a time for some breath.

His mind wanders around as he walks down the street, his eyes scanning around the open spaces on each level, his feeling dissolving into the Force around them.

From Level Zero to Level Four, the lower he reaches, the shabbier and narrower the streets become. The houses are smaller, lower, more broken. Doors and windows are covered with paper and cloth patches, even a wooden plank patch would be a luxury. Barely any street light.

No living creature in sight. It's as if he's just walking around on a detonated, nuclear wasted planet.

Obi-Wan speeds up his steps, not wanting to stay too long in any of these levels.

He goes to the Level Five next.

There is something different about Level Five, he senses it as soon as he steps out of the speeder. The vision, the smell, the rigorousness, a living life form in a dead city. It takes his conscious mind one more second to realize what's the difference.

The street walls are neither barren nor grey. Not the dirty color with occasional red and black smudges that look like nothing other than dried blood. Unlike other Levels.

In here, the walls are unbelievably colorful, with bright colors scattering all over the color spectrum, as if painting palettes for rainbows are poured onto the walls. There are words and sentences too, together with graffities of cartoonized figures, exaggerated creations, images of random creatures, symbols that aren't any known language to his knowledge. The end of brushes are almost always rushed, with visible unclean stroke, as if whoever did this has to finish the thing in a tight time frame.

Obi-Wan walks down the street, staring at those graffities with wide eyes. People are getting bold and reckless down here. That sense of disturbance in the Force is getting stronger the longer he looks at them. He fidgets uneasily as he examines them.

The paints those graffities were using seem normal enough, the cheap kind that one can find anywhere, probably even locally in each level. The content, however, maybe has something worth noticing -- though he can't really understand what they're about for the most parts. They are like doodling, coming out of wild imagination of a five-year-old. It's refreshing in an almost disturbing way.

He doesn't know how to make of it -- so he reports it in, like the new Jedi code the Emperor required.

<br>

The Emperor assembles an emergency meeting the very next day, calling Obi-Wan to report what he saw. Officers and representatives from different areas of expertise are requested. Count Dooku, the Emperor's personal guard stands right behind his throne.

Obi-Wan tries his best to explain those abstract bright lines and curves and patterns, realizing words are too pale to describe, one has to see to know what he's talking about. He finishes awkwardly with that exact suggestion.

Emperor Palpatine asks him to go back to his seat.

A group of representatives of the meeting says it's nothing to worry about, maybe just a kid messing around. Another group says it's a clear and aggressive sign of rebellion against the Empire, anyone involved in it should be arrested and executed immediately. And another asks nonchalantly why that is even a problem.

The Emperor coughs loudly, and starts speaking slowly: "This is a gesture of dissatisfaction from a small group of people, lashing out their childish emotions on public properties. This should not be allowed. Those paintings might increase the doubt in people's mind, affecting the brief peace we have fought so hard to earn and finally have now. I will add the new regulation in tonight's announcements to prohibit such behavior."

Therefore by night, when the new and old regulations are being broadcast, Obi-Wan isn't exactly surprised to find out a newly added regulation, but hearing the exact words still makes his heart twist in discomfort. The new regulation says: "Any and all, public or private, display of all formats, regarding personal expression unaligned with the Empire Value is illegal, including but not limited to street art, street painting, street performance. Therefore, certain behaviors like graffiti are strictly forbidden, and anyone who conducted this illegal behavior will be held legal responsibility, arrested and personally investigated by The Emperor and the highest security team."

By "highest security team," he undoubtedly means Count Dooku himself.

Obi-Wan chokes on the water he's drinking, feeling a sick wrench at the lower of his stomach, as if he's both punched there hard and going to vomit at the same time.

He rushes toward the door of his chamber.

And runs right into Count Dooku.

Obi-Wan halts harshly, holding on the door to steady himself, more startled than surprised. "Count Dooku," he greets, trying his best to keep his voice and breath stable.

Count Dooku eyes him, "Jedi master Kenobi, so good to see you. The Emperor has an assignment for you. We have reason to believe those graffities are signs where a new rebellion force is forming, endangering the peace and stability of the Empire. You are tasked to find those dangerous rebellion sources, and take them to the Emperor. If you fail, *I* will go to the Lower Level myself. Do you understand?"

"Yes, perfectly clear. I will be on my way to the Lower Level immediately," Obi-Wan hears his voice answer automatically.

Count Dooku nods once with approval, still watching him. His gaze lays a heavy, palpable weight on Obi-Wan's back like a snake winding around a prey, as he dashes down the corridor toward his speeder.

Descending into the darkness of the Lower Level has never before feels so comforting. Just knowing the distance from the choking air up there increases as he flies down makes his clenched heart uncoiling -- even just the slightest. He still doesn't know what exactly he'd be running into down there, and what he'd do if he finds those people.

Obi-Wan breathes more easily and steadily with the artificial wind when he arrives at Level Five.

<br>

The night doesn't give him enough information -- at least that's the reason he gives himself -- so Obi-Wan thinks he might as well wait until the day time to continue his investigation.

He drifts across the streets like a living ghost.

The street comes to life when the morning comes.

The view shifts so much from the curfewed dark night that he can barely recognize it is still the same place. The colorful markings and doodles on the walls are almost like real, living lives, waking up in the brighter day night, yawning and gazing at the pedestrians. And look at those pedestrians! Most of them dress in exotic cloth from so many different alien culture, it's hard to tell apart which colors are stationary on the walls, which ones moving with the local people. Obi-Wan feels as if he's fording in the pond of color when he walks through the streets.

He steps closer to the walls, standing before the one near one end of the street, watching it closely.

He doesn't know much about art, or painting, or whatever style this may be called in academia -- abstractionism or something along the line -- he just hopes the observation can give him some answer of where to locate the mysterious now-number-one-wanted graffiti artist.

The longer he stares, the more senses those characters and patterns seem to be presenting themselves. He thinks he can spot a few repetitive pattern with certain combination of colors and characters. But it could also be coincidences that his mind is just making up theories he wishes to see.

Encryption and decryption isn't his best school work, nor is art. Obi-Wan sighs, taking out his personal handheld datapad, starts taking record of these arts to take back for analysis in the Jedi library computer later.

He doesn't realize the way his feet was taking him along the painted wall that leads toward the end of the alley, where the bar that almost caused him that fight with the locals located, until he's already at its door.

The last graffiti ends outside the bar.

Obi-Wan halts his steps sharply in front of the bar, ready to take a turn. It is at this exact moment, a figure emerges from the exit door, almost bumping right into him.

"Excuse me," a familiar, young voice says.

Obi-Wan looks up, running into a pair of recognizable eyes. "It's you."

That reckless, defiant, young boy with blue eyes glares back at him. His eyes narrow with recognition, "You again, Jedi."

"Jedi Master Kenobi," Obi-Wan can't help correcting him.

"I remember," the boy smirks, looking right back at him, the same way he did last time. His cloth is even dirtier than last time -- no, not "dirty," more colorful. More paints with the same set of bright colors on those walls has left marks and smudges on his thin shirt and cheap hooded jacket with the same color as his eyes. In his hands, he's holding a handful of spray cans.

Obi-Wan's heart sinks when his eyes land on those. Yet somehow, he thinks he already knows it even before running into the boy again.

The boy follows his gaze and sees where his attention gets attracted to. He shifts his arms so the cans are half hidden behind his body.

"I see you're interested in arts," Obi-Wan comments cautiously, glancing at the painted walls beside them. "Did you not hear the latest regulation announced last night? The street arts and graffities are strictly forbidden now."

The boy quirks a smirking smile, "I wonder who did those arts, I'll make sure to let them know not to do that again." The silent challenge is more than loud enough for Obi-Wan to hear in his undertones: *You don't have proof it's me. That's why you're just standing here staring at me, waiting for me to give up evidence, aren't you? Think again, I'm not stupid. So what are you going to do, Kenobi?*

And that is exactly why Obi-Wan can't take him in now -- he'll need more proof than the cans to call the boy suspicious or guilty. He'll have to catch him in action or something of the kind.

Obi-Wan can do nothing but glare at him.

Another voice calls across the street: "Ani, you coming or not?"

The boy's head jerks to the source of the voice. "In a minute," he yells back.

Obi-Wan raises his eyebrows in a joyful beam. "So it's Ani."

"It's 'Anakin' to you," the boy snaps. "'Ani' is only for my friends."

"Alright, Anakin," Obi-Wan says compliantly, voice softer, glancing at the spray cans in his hands again. "Just so you know, whoever is painting those, I'll have to arrest them if I find them."

Anakin shrugs carelessly. "Then I'll make sure they are never found." He turns to catch up with his friends.

Obi-Wan watches his back with a lump in his throat.

He goes back to study the paintings for the rest of the day, and he doesn't run into Anakin for another three days.

Obi-Wan: "not set in stone"

Obi-Wan is tasked to clean out lower Coruscant instability sources

### Chap 3 (Trick)

> Obi-Wan runs into Anakin again. Anakin join/form/lead secret rebel force, starting with childhood friends, advocating rebellion with graffiti art. Obi-Wan notices Anakin's Jedi potential, impressed, starts swaying, chases around, starts to appreciate the art (graffiti actually are code words for assemblies, words/certain color combinations have special meanings, they have a set of secret word, red+skeleton=danger; purple/yellow+snake pattern=drop everything and run, the more poisonous the snake, the bigger the danger; blue+dove=safe, green+certain keyword/beard=next meeting time/location and proceed as usual), gets tricked to underground rebellious meeting (Obi-Wan thinks he starts able to decode the message, but actually they purposefully leave the hint)

Obi-Wan ends up not sending the images of the graffities to the Jedi library for analysis. He chooses to sit down before the painted walls, and starts studying them on his own. He can't explain why he's doing all that.

He doesn't even go back to the Upper Level for his daily check-in reports. Merely sending in messages to say he's in the undercover task, he'll be in touch when convenient.

The Emperor seems pleased that he's been spending all his time down here, but he suspects Count Dooku might not be so patient, from the replies he received. He doesn't have much time -- either to figure out what's happening in the Lower Level and fix the situation by himself, or probably have to watch someone else to come down here fixing it for him, which includes fixing *him*.

Obi-Wan takes a long breath, pulling his thought back to the graffiti arts. He thinks he's getting closer.

The art is very expressional and artistic, to say the least. But now he's also fairly certain they're also equally informational. The Emperor's suspicion on it being a sign of rebellion's existence might not be entirely unreasonable.

There are certain color and word combinations that've been repeatedly spotted from different part of the streets, followed closely by a different set of color and unrecognizable characters, usually in green and blue. And if the leading combination is in red and has a skeleton or skull somewhere around, no matter how small they are, then no more mysterious characters.

Obi-Wan thinks he's starting to get the whole language system in the art, if only he can find a decoder ring to fill in the remaining gap.

And the opportunity presents itself quicker than he knows. Like a blessing that his prayer is answered.

<br>

On the third day after he knows Anakin's name, he runs into the boy again. And this time, he catches him right on the crime scene.

Obi-Wan is examining a back alley where a new set of painting has been freshly added. Judging by the undried paint, he'd guess whoever did this -- even if he knows it must be Anakin, he's still leaving the space for reasonable doubt -- they can't be far. Those new graffities are at most two hours old, the tail of the stroke is rushed in smudged blue.

He follows the only way where that alley leads, and sees Anakin busy working on a new pattern just a block away. He holds a spray can and the paint lands on the wall with a curve.

Obi-Wan dashes toward him quietly, but Anakin already senses his approach like a cat hearing human's footsteps.

The boy seems surprised to see him there, but as soon as his eyes land on Obi-Wan, there is a small mischievous twitch on his lips. From the distance, Obi-Wan can't tell if it's a smirk or panicked gasp. The kid doesn't bother collecting the cans at the foot of the wall, just turning to the tail of the alley and running.

Obi-Wan picks up his pace to follow him closely.

But the Lower Level, if nothing else, is *the* most perfect place for hide-and-seek. And Anakin has clearly spent enough time here to know all the small turns and hideouts and hidden doors, and he's certainly not hesitant to utilize those knowledge. He slips through them nimbly like rabbit in the field.

Within five minutes, Obi-Wan finds himself in the middle of a residential area, surrounded by houses with closed windows and doors. Anakin could have been hidden in any one of them, or he might already escape to the other end of this Level, maybe even to a different Level, if he wants. Obi-Wan would have to knock on every door to be sure, and if that comes out with empty hands, he might as well dig the whole Level's ground to be able to find him again.

Obi-Wan goes back the way he comes.

Even those scattered cans at the foot of the wall have been taken. Anakin must have come back when he manages to get rid of Obi-Wan's trail. The boy is good, Obi-Wan has to give him that.

He studies the new graffiti instead. The pattern that he remembers seeing blue is now covered by a red skeleton. A strong stroke of purple mixed with some dark yellow crosses out something that was probably green down there, the letters of the unknown language is now completely indistinct.

Looks exactly like a warning notice and something like an evacuation order that cancelled a previously scheduled assembly because something dangerous has happened. *OH --* Obi-Wan realizes suddenly. Something dangerous like a Jedi has been in sight. *Him.*

They have a communication system to warn about his route, that must be why it's been so difficult to even spot a foot track of Anakin. Or anyone else he might be working with. And if they have been going through all these trouble just to hide something from him, then there must be something utterly serious that needs ultimate secrecy. Something bigger than just some graffiti art.

The Emperor's suspicion of a rebel force might just be on the right track.

If only he could be sure.

Obi-Wan glances down at the ground, looking for more leads.

And there, on the ground, among dirty paper tissues stained with sprays, cigarette butts, and other trashes, are scattered, torn scraps of a paper. Looks exactly like any other trash, and easily mistaken as just a normal piece of random trash, but the same kind of disturbance when he senses around Anakin also surrounds them, as if they're calling for him.

Obi-Wan spends about an hour picking up every small piece of the scraps he can find and puts them back together. The tears are random and careless, making it probably the worse puzzle game in the world, but not impossible to recover. Not for him, at least.

And lucky for him, the words on the paper are not ruined by the tears. What he finds on there, however, makes his eyes widened.

In scratchy and barely legible writing, it's the exact translation guidance he wishes to find, about the meanings of the symbols on the wall.

Not all of them, it seems, when he cross-compares the symbols in front of him with the patterns on the paper. And there are still gaps in the paper where the scrapes must have been blown away by the wind. But enough to make sense and understand the crucial message.

The red skeleton and skull is a warning sign, just as he concluded. The combination of purple and that certain dark yellow snaky pattern means "drop everything and run." That greenish blue means safe, and there is a specific symbol for each of about a dozen locations and each hour of the day. With a certain combination, one can know exactly when and where -- for a next meeting, undoubtedly.

"You really think tearing it up would be enough to hide from a Jedi, Anakin? You shouldn't underestimate me," Obi-Wan murmurs to the paper, feeling it's a little too easy. He wonders if it's because this time he was already too close to catching him, and the boy had to run in a fluster escape.

He takes out his personal datapad to take a photo of the pieced-together paper, and ignites the original with his lightsaber. Obi-Wan only thinks back why he did it until after all the paper pieces became burned, black ashes. And he doesn't have a good answer. *Just for safety.* He tells himself. But even he knows it sounds a little lame.

He decidedly steers his mind away and starts looking for their next assembly plan.

He does not report this latest breakthrough finding, either. He tells himself he'd report once he's found something more solid. He doesn't have enough proof yet.

The only proof that turned into the ash flies in the air when a breeze comes by. They're scattered farther, and then gone without a trace.

<br>

Their next assembly will be in the basement of a deserted factory, three hours before the curfew on a Taungsday afternoon.

Obi-Wan finds the latest piece of graffiti with the announcement another two days later, and thanks to the decoder sheet, he reads it like looking into words written in plain common language. And with bright colors and powerful strokes, the art is practically shouting "Freedom" and "Rebel" at his face, along with some really strong words regarding the Empire. If the Upper Level ever finds out the true meaning of these arts, anyone involved would get electrocuted. No question asked.

Obi-Wan frowned at them when he saw them, eyebrows deeply furrowed. He can't feel more glad that at least among everyone from security and guarding forces, *he* is the one tasked for this and finding out what they're plotting. He can't imagine what kind of massacre it would turn into, if Count Dooku ever comes down here and finds what he found. It gives him a shiver when he imagines the colorful walls are splattered with dark bloody red.

The back door of that deserted factory is loosely opened with a slit when he arrives, an hour before the assembly starts. He sneaks in easily without a sound. The rusty door looks as if it's going to moan when he passes it, but he wills it to be quiet, and god-blessingly it complies.

The place is dim and shabby, much like all the constructions in this Level nowadays. But in the middle of the ground, there is a big enough opening for people to gather. Perhaps to have some treacherous discussions, if he has to guess, maybe even some bold movement against the Empire -- for which he can snuff out the bud of an rebellion against the Empire now that he's here. Obi-Wan figures, hiding behind a corner behind a broken column, waiting patiently for the assembly to start.

An hour passes.

And then the second hour.

The space is getting darker as it comes closer to the night time. The only light comes in through a dirty window high on the wall, near the edge of the ceiling.

Only when Obi-Wan starts doubting if he's really translating those patterns correctly, or the sheet is lying, people start walking in.

But instead of hearing a radical, reactionary, bolshy assembly as he expected, those people start talking about the tough lives civilians were living nowadays under the Empire's military control, the suffocating atmosphere that stifles any creative expressions, the assistance each one of them can provide for one another, and most of all, how they can make people's life better.

They are kind, and friendly, and calm. Only when they talk about their neighbors' starved kids or sick elderlies do they sound emotional, sobbing quietly in unshed tears.

Obi-Wan swallows hard as he listens.

*These are just people.* He thinks, astonished and uncharacteristically upset, behind the column, in the shadow he hides, just like the shadow those people are used to live in. These are just ordinary people trying so hard to have a life, and the Empire is squeezing their living space, suffocating them mentally and physically.

He doesn't realize since when has he started clenching his fist or biting on his teeth, or what's that for. He forces his fists and jaws to relax, and continues listening. He's still a Jedi for this galaxy, after all. Surely maintaining a peaceful galaxy is more important than one poor kid or one old man. His job tonight is still to follow the order and arrest the dangerous rebel forces, led by none other then the familiar one who has a young voice and a familiar slender figure.

Obi-Wan stares at the boy -- a young man actually, he looks more like a leader now, standing before the group, soothing them with soft voice, giving them instructions of how to fix some of the difficulties -- how to fix a tool that's broken, who to ask for medical advices, what to do to release a pain, what they're short of and where they might find, and many more. Anakin is still in his art-smudged hooded jacket, but the whole vibe radiating from him seems so different -- less of a dreamy naughty artist, but a responsible leader that actually cares about people, helps people. Except, undoubtedly, evidently, he *is* a rebellion force now, from the Empire's perspective, gathering secret assemblies, encouraging the complaints toward the Empire, disassembling the hard-earned peace the Empire is trying to maintain. There is no defense for that.

Obi-Wan takes a candid photo from his hidden position, bites his lips, and goes back to continue staring at the scene. *Does he really have to take him in? But he doesn't seem to have a choice, does he? The order is quiet clear, so is the consequence.*

He remembers Count Dooku's figure, swaying before his eyes like a shadow, with a quiet but menacing tone: "If you fail, *I* will go to the Lower Level myself. Do you understand?"

His hands are clenched into fists with white knuckles again.

He's so focused in his thoughts now he almost doesn't realize since when the conversation and the assembly has stopped. People's talking voice die down like waning sea waves, but they're oddly not leaving yet.

Obi-Wan wonders what their next move is going to be, when the young voice echoes in the space, loud and clear: "How long are you planning on hiding there, Jedi Master Kenobi?"

#### draft notes

**flashback casual mention introduce past events:** ep2 timeline, Palpatine started clone war, had Jedi and senate all in control. ep3 timeline (current, 19 BBY), Palpatine becomes emperor, all uncooperative Jedi were persecuted or went hiding (e.g. Yoda/Windu disappeared) (=canon Order 66), remaining Jedi mostly get brainwashed/forced to become Palpatine's personal police force. Without Anakin, Dooku is still alive so far, active in conducting Palpatine's orders.

Anakin join/form/lead secret rebel force, starting with childhood friends (e.g. Kitster Banai, Wald, Amee), advocating rebellion with graffiti art

### Chap 4 (Choice)

> Obi-Wan knows about rebel force, is given the option of join them and fight against emperor and very likely die, or comply with Jedi brainwash doctrine and fight against rebels, neither know if he'd get harmed by rebels or he'd win and bring Anakin in, which would likely cause Anakin executed by Dooku.
>
> Obi-Wan's decision point, has to choose a side. He chooses them, is let go. start with only small help/subtle sign of slipping to their side, e.g. a few times when chasing around he actually already run into Anakin/could have arrested him but deliberately pretend as if missed. slow(/steep?) slip, every decision point actually all chooses Anakin, very clear starting to change side

The voice snaps Obi-Wan out of his thought. A flashlight flares at the corner he's hiding, blinding him for a temporary second.

Obi-Wan has no option but to comes out of the high maintenance platform, being in the center of the light and people's gaze. Now he knows full aware of the expression: "Like a deer in the spotlight." But he's not intimated by those people, he tells himself. Certainly not by this young man.

The crowd is quiet, so is their leader.

Obi-Wan approaches them carefully, just in case any sudden move from either side would turn this potentially, seemingly peaceful gathering into something far worse.

He stops two steps away from Anakin. The boy turns off his flashlight, regarding him seriously, meeting his eyes.

The silence increases the room temperature rapidly.

Obi-Wan has to clear his throat to break the awkwardness. "So you know I'm here," he blurts out, immediately feeling like a fool to note the obvious.

Anakin huffs a short laugh. "I thought you lost my invitation."

"Invitation?" Obi-Wan raises his eyebrows incredulously.

Anakin chuckles briefly. "How else could you find out we're going to meet here?"

Obi-Wan tilts his head slightly, "Those torn paper --"

Anakin raises one side of his eyebrows, suggestive, waiting.

Realization hits Obi-Wan. "Oh, Jesus, did you leave there on purpose? Is it a trap?"

Anakin proper laughs. "Bingo."

"Why?" Obi-Wan stares at him.

Anakin just shrugs. "You're looking for us, aren't you? Now you find us, what do you think?"

The look on his face is so difficult to read. Obi-Wan tries to find a hint of mischief or malevolence there, but he finds neither. The boy keeps his face straight, but his eyes, there is something deep and swirling in his eyes. Waiting.

*He's nervous.* Obi-Wan realizes. So are all the people in the room. He can barely hear anyone breathing.

Obi-Wan swallows, and shifts his gaze to the side. He starts slowly and carefully, "This is an unlawful gathering, and you know it. The Empire has long forbidden any type of underground meeting, with rebellious potentials."

The people around them start murmuring earnestly. Obi-Wan isn't paying full attention to their words, but he can already tell the tone isn't the most friendly.

Anakin holds out a hand to them, and the whisper quiets.

Obi-Wan glances at him again, and finds his gaze never sway. He feels himself unable to move or hide in those eyes. He finds himself *seen*, for the first time in a long time.

"Not just potential," Anakin challenges him. "You may call us a full-on rebel force. What are you going to do?"

Another quiet round of gasps around them.

The nervousness deepens into a dark undercurrent in his eyes. His voice may sound calm and confident, but his gaze says otherwise.

Obi-Wan doesn't know if his own eyes look exactly like that. He swallows again. "I can arrest you," he tries his best to speak in a business tone, nonchalant and robotic, like he's in auto-pilot mode, but his heart pounds loudly against his eardrums. He gives the crowd a quick look-around. "I can arrest all of you."

"I told you it's a bad idea, Ani!" Another young boy's voice shouts out angrily from his left.

"Not so quick, Kitster," Anakin answers him without looking. "Maybe he's not like them."

"Maybe I'm exactly like them," Obi-Wan retorts.

Anakin narrows his eyes, "Are you? Then why are you still standing here, instead of, I don't know, kill me or something? You do know if you arrest us, the only ending for any of us is death, right?"

Obi-Wan averts his gaze. "Maybe I heard some of you talking, maybe I'm generous enough to spare you this time, but don't mistake it for weak or pardoning from the Empire. If there is anyone else from the Empire knows about this, about you, then you're doomed. All of you are."

"But not you." A small grin sprouts at the tip of Anakin's lips. "I know you're different."

"Don't be so optimistic," Obi-Wan says grimly, feeling the wrench at his stomach twist even worse than before. "I'm trained with a code and a doctrine for my life, and my only order is for the people and the Empire to be safe, to keep peace. The moment you do anything endangering this peace --"

"I will," Anakin cuts him off, daring him again. "I'm telling you, Kenobi, there will be a day the people will rise against the Empire -- actually, it's the Empire that's against the people now." He takes a large step closer to Obi-Wan. The distance between them is less than a foot now. And he is a few inches taller than the Jedi master. "Then which side are you in, Jedi? Us, or them?"

Obi-Wan shifts uncomfortably. "Don't make me do this, Anakin," he says in a low voice.

"Join us," Anakin ignores his quiet uneasiness, flame of enthusiasm burning in his eyes. "Join us to free the people, fight against the unfairness, the Emperor, gives people the freedom back."

"Or what?" Obi-Wan takes a step back, distancing himself from the boy, shooting a quick glance at the surrounding again. Some people are fidgeting, hiding their hands behind their back, in a way as if they're gripping at something. Weapons, perhaps? Obi-Wan speculates. "Are you trying to imprison me or something?"

Anakin shakes his head with a small hint of frustration. "I wouldn't dare. In fact, I was just thinking if I fail on this bet, then that's the end of this, of me anyway. You may take me in all you want, and I'll just... get killed by the Empire or something."

Obi-Wan widens his eyes, once again thrown off-balance by the boy's boldness and straightforwardness. "You're betting your life on me?"

"Yes," Anakin answers without hesitation, and without blinking. Obi-Wan's heart skips a beat at the answer. The boy continues, "I'm trusting my feelings, and my feelings tell me you're worth trying. Don't prove me wrong, Kenobi."

Obi-Wan wets his lips. His heart continues beating too fast and too loud.

It seems forever until he can give an answer again.

"Obi-Wan," he says.

"What?"

"You can call me Obi-Wan," he tells him. "If you want."

The smile on Anakin spreads wide like sunshine shining through a flower field. "Thank you, Obi-Wan," he says whole-heartedly, letting out a long relieved breath.

"Now, go. Before the curfew starts or I change my mind. It's not my patrol tonight, and you definitely don't want to run into anyone else." Obi-Wan can't stop a similar small smile crawling its way onto his lips as well, seeing the relief and cheer on all their faces. People's murmuring grows louder and lighter, and they start moving out of the place.

Anakin doesn't move, not until all the rest have left the place.

"You should go, too," Obi-Wan reminds him. "It's unwise to step your toes on all the lines."

Anakin gives him a funny look. "That's the story of my life, you know."

Obi-Wan grimaces. "In fact, I don't know."

The boy is actually surprised. "Aren't you guys like, 'Big Brother is watching you' type? Knows everything about everyone?"

The rising tip of Obi-Wan's lips drops. He shakes his head briefly. "I have a feeling there is much misunderstanding."

"And *I*, have a feeling that you have something else you want to say, but not in front of everyone." Anakin observes.

Obi-Wan makes a sound out of his nose, bordering both impressiveness and annoyance. "How many 'feelings' do you have? Have some more, and you may call yourself a psychic."

Anakin shrugs uncaringly. "Mom used to tell me to trust my intuitions, and mine is usually quite good. Now, don't change the subject, what is it that's still bothering you?"

"Oh, let me see where should I start --" Obi-Wan says sourly. "I do this, we might very likely die before we can do anything. Do you have any idea how powerful the Emperor is, or the whole security and special forces are up there? How impossible it is to keep a secret from them, let alone a whole rebellious force? *And*, Count Dooku has given very explicit instruction, if I fail to seize the person behind those graffiti -- you, he'll come down here himself. By then, there will be no hope of speaking your way out of it."

Anakin listens carefully, tilting his head slightly in his deep thought. "Do you know how long we still have before the Upstairs notices anything?"

"Days, maybe weeks. I can't say for sure," Obi-Wan considers. "Patience is usually not one of their virtues."

Anakin snorts. "Do they have any, at all? Doing all these to us, taking away our freedom, our voice. You saw that, everyone with a heart would know how wrong that is. Do they even have a heart?"

Obi-Wan shifts uncomfortably. What Anakin described, isn't that exactly himself before today? Is that saying *he* also didn't grow a heart? Obi-Wan doesn't know what to answer, but luckily, it seems Anakin isn't waiting for one, either.

"Anyway," the boy wraps, "Good to know. We can still use whatever time we have to prepare."

"For what? What are you going to do?" Obi-Wan is suddenly tense again.

Anakin gives him a mysterious smile, "You'll see."

<br>

#### draft notes

some talk about trust issue, Anakin trusts his intuition, trusts Obi-Wan

after Obi-Wan actually changes his side, the addressing changes to Obi-Wan

### Chap 5 (Attraction)

> Obi-Wan takes more and more interest in Anakin, learn more about him and his past and ideation (Anakin talk about his childhood and why his interest in art), the two of them talk more, learn about each other more, start join rebellion meetings (start with only listen at outer rim, not speak), start secretly training Anakin properly, teach him use weapons and Force power.

*Maybe that's a bad idea,* Obi-Wan's mind wanders off. Now that he's back in the Upper Level again, sitting in the council room of the Imperial Palace, surrounded by shiny reflective walls and pillars, his mind clears. *God, what has him been thinking lately?* But maybe, maybe Anakin does have a point, instead of being clearer, his mind might just be more clouded when he's up here. It's so bright, with so much refined civility from everyone, he just can't see anything anymore.

"Do you have any findings during your investigation in the Lower Level, Master Kenobi?" Emperor Palpatine directly addresses him suddenly.

Obi-Wan is startled slightly, not expecting to be called out. "Nothing, my Lord," he answers too quickly, having to take a second to calm his breath, and then adding some more notes. "The people who created those art -- I mean, the disrespectful smudges and scrawls -- are very slippery and difficult to keep track of. I'm doing my best, and I will ensure to let Your Majesty know any progress when I have them."

"Maybe I should tend to the matter personally," Count Dooku comments on the side grimly. "Not to suggest your incompetence, Master Kenobi, but perhaps you can use some backup and support."

Obi-Wan answers hastily but carefully. "The proposal is appreciated, Count Dooku, but I believe that should not be necessary. I'm sure there are more urgent and higher priority tasks in the Galaxy that require your attention. I wouldn't think running around in those tiny dirty alleys would be the best use of your time. But I will guarantee to report to this meeting any and all threat to the Empire, as soon as I find any."

"Yes, you will," Count Dooku presses.

Emperor Palpatine pins his gaze on Obi-Wan for a second longer, before shifting to ask about the next pressing issue. While Count Dooku's eyes stay even longer.

Obi-Wan feels as if he's a fly caught by a spider net, or choked and strangled on the throat by the bare stare. His chest has barely enough air for him to breathe and survive the meeting.

He regrets coming in person.

After spending a whole week in the Lower Level, it's Anakin who suggested him go back to the Upstairs, just in case his absence has raised any suspicion. But the lack of progress is equally suspicious. It's unlike him to not able to capture a fugitive for this long, let alone just someone residing within Coruscant. Obi-Wan can't help but wonders how much further he can keep testing Palpatine and Dooku's patience.

They're running out of time.

<br>

Obi-Wan finds Anakin again, at the back alley opposite to the bar. The boy is painting a rainbow wing when Obi-Wan approaches him. He's humming some tune off-keys.

"Are you not going to escape?" Obi-Wan asks on purpose.

Anakin doesn't even bother turning his head. He's appreciating his new work, adding some stroke where it seem missing. "Are you going to arrest me?"

Obi-Wan sighs, "I really should say 'yes'. You never know, one of these days, I might change my answer, or it might not be me coming down here. You should be more careful."

Anakin stops the graffiti, wiping his paint-distained hand on a piece of ragged cloth. "Why, something happened? Does the Emperor suspect anything?"

Obi-Wan shakes his head. "That's the problem. I don't know. I can't tell. But they might be."

That's not anything new to either of them.

Anakin turns back to the painting, and asks him, "What do you think about this one?"

The pair of big colorful wings spread high and proud on the wall, leaving a small space in the middle where a person can just fit in and pretend those wings are their own. It's dreamy and beautiful. More artistic than most of the quick sketches Obi-Wan used to find on the wall.

"It's beautiful," Obi-Wan looks at the wings, thinking, wings means fly, fly means sky. They should belong to sky, where the sun can shine.

Anakin regards it for a minute in comfortable silence right on his side, then steps into the gap between the wings, spreading his arms. "I can fly now," he says with a grin.

The wings look so vivid as if they grow from his shoulder blades behind his back. The kid looks genuinely happy at this moment, Obi-Wan realizes. For some reason, it makes his throat thick and dry. He swallows difficultly around the lump, before managing to answer with a matching tight smile, "Yes, you can. You are."

Except, Anakin maybe have never even seen a real sky -- living in the under world, looking up only to an artificial sky, but he still dreams of such beautiful color and all those ideations. How can he keep doing that?

Obi-Wan wipes his eyes subtly, having to distract himself. "I didn't know the translation of this one though, it's not on your decoding sheet." He nods at the big wall paint, asking.

"Doesn't need to." Anakin turns back to look at it one more time before beginning to pack his scattering painting cans. "Everyone can understand it just by looking at it, don't you think?"

Obi-Wan has to agree. The art can speak for itself, so is the color. The wings can fly, people are dreaming of the sky that they're prohibited to see. The longing of the freedom, the dream and hope, the beautiful wishes, it's all right there. It's more powerful than any word could ever express. It's emotional in a way words can never achieve. It really is the best way of expression they can possibly find -- and the Empire deems it illegal, and he is a part of the forces that help it maintain that facade of peace and normalcy. Obi-Wan smiles bitterly.

All he can do is to take a photo of the art using his personal datapad, just so he can look at it whenever he wants, in case he forgets it.

Obi-Wan finds the boy squinting at his device curiously when he pockets it, but Anakin swiftly pretends he's just finishing up the tidy-up work.

"It's called a datapad," Obi-Wan says.

"I know," Anakin answers quickly, touching the back of his ear, turning to walk toward the street.

Obi-Wan trails him with a step's distance. "Hmm," he makes a mocking sound through his nose, "thought you'd say 'Never seen it before'."

"What do you think I am, a barbarian?" Anakin gives him a humiliated glance.

"And you're not?" Obi-Wan says deliberately, with a small hidden grin under his beard.

Anakin glares at him, "I remember *someone* said once 'there is much misunderstanding' between us." He mimics Obi-Wan's tone perfectly.

Obi-Wan rolls his eyes. "Well, I wouldn't know if you don't tell me everything about yourself."

"Same applies to you," Anakin bites back.

"Looks like it's settled then," Obi-Wan says, with a satisfied smile. "What about I buy you a meal, and let's talk."

Anakin stops his hurried steps to consider, then, "Dex's Diner," he demands.

"Deal," Obi-Wan agrees without hesitation.

"No deal if you're going in with these," Anakin squints at his armor.

Obi-Wan frowns slightly, self-conscious under his eyes for the first time in a long time. He tugs the skirt of his tunic. "What's wrong with my clothes?"

Anakin chuckles. "*What's wrong with your clothes?* You might as well print out the biggest sign saying 'I'm Emperor's Henchman' and stick it on your head. Do you want to get side-eyes wherever you are or what?"

Obi-Wan touches the empirical symbol on his shoulder, the one that usually reminds him of his high rank as general and usually offers a small amount sense of achievement, it now only triggers an uneasiness.

He takes off the brown tunic and the black armor, wrapping them like a bundle.

Anakin hands him a white jacket of his own from his bag, and taking the bundle to stuff everything back in.

"I want that back later," the kid says with a straight face.

Obi-Wan stifles a laugh. "Of course."

The jacket is a little too small for his size, and smells of cheap soap and a lingering smell of paint.

It smells of Anakin.

Obi-Wan tries very hard not to think about any of that.

<br>

Dex's Diner isn't at the busiest hour when they go in.

The owner gives Anakin a warm welcome from behind the counter, and looks surprised to see Obi-Wan follow.

Anakin takes the two-seat booth at the far end of the diner, the farthest to the door and any other patrons.

Obi-Wan wonders if it's because the kid doesn't want anyone see them together, or just want their conversation to have some more privacy. He opens his mouth, ready to speak, but Anakin raises one finger, stopping him right on time: "No, food first. I'm starving."

When the droid waitress comes to their table, Anakin orders a whole lot of food that's enough to feed an army: the sliders, sandwich, steak, cheese dog. He passes the menu across the table with a gleeful smile.

Obi-Wan doesn't look at the menu, telling the droid, "I'll just have a cup of Jawa Juice, thanks."

He turns back to find Anakin studies him with interest. "What?"

"You know this place," the kid accuses, as if he's the one being scammed.

Obi-Wan shrugs slightly. "I've been here before, you know."

"I don't know that. And I bet it takes more than one visit to remember or have a favorite drink on the menu of a random diner on a random underground level." Anakin points out.

"Not random," Obi-Wan corrects him. "Just happened to be this exact place. My master used to come here, sometimes he'd take me with, but that's more than ten years ago now. Didn't they advertise to be the best diner in the underworld?"

Anakin grins. "They did! It used to be 'the best diner in the Coco Town', and now it's 'the best diner in the underworld'. I've always wanted to try here."

Obi-Wan almost blurts out "Why didn't you," but manages to stops himself at the last second. Looking at the kid's humble dressing and slim figure, he thinks he knows the answer already.

He glances at the diner's interior for a second, to cover the unnatural silence. It looks almost exactly the same as he remembers, only a decade older.

The droid FLO brings their drinks and the appetizer just in time.

Obi-Wan takes a swig at the drink. It also tastes the same as he remembers.

"So, you have a master," Anakin says carefully when he puts down the cup.

"Qui-Gon Jinn," Obi-Wan tells him quietly, suddenly realizing it might also be the first time in a long time that he mentioned to anyone anything from before all the craziness of the Galactic Empire started. And somehow, in front of Anakin, it feels easy to tell without feeling his chest too tight or his breath too difficult. "I lost him fourteen years ago."

"Same year my mom died," Anakin says. His Adam's Apple bobs up and down.

"I'm sorry," Obi-Wan says, and Anakin shakes his head slightly to dismiss it.

"It's been a long time now," the boy stares at an oily spot on the table, blinking slowly. "I don't think about that often."

"How old were you?"

"Nine."

"Oh God," Obi-Wan breathes out.

Anakin tries to smile a little but fails. "Must be why I can't really remember much."

*Might be a good thing.* Obi-Wan thinks distantly. At least he doesn't have to relive those horrible moments. He wonders if it's a terrible idea to ask "how," but the kid already starts talking regardless.

"Actually I can't remember most of the things before fifteen, but Kitster -- my best friend, we sort of grew up together -- he's the one that keeps a diary and has a good memory. I wouldn't know where I came from without him -- but it doesn't really matter now." Anakin drinks the juice again, finishing the cup in two gulps.

The sandwich is served with a side of fries, grease oozing through the paper napkin onto the plate. He grabs the wrap and starts biting.

"You're not born here?" Curiosity leads Obi-Wan throw out questions. He just wants to know more about this boy. One part of his brain is saying he's doing this just as a part of the investigation, he needs to know the basic information of his suspect one way or another; the other part... is making some very confusing disturbance that makes his stomach twitch and he tries to ignore it.

Anakin shakes his head with his mouth full. He answers after he swallows the bite: "Kitster said we were both born somewhere far away that even his mom didn't remember where, then when we were three, he and his mom, and me and my mom, were all sold to an underground black market art smuggler here in Coruscant, through a slave auction. Hutts on Tatooine were a really close bidder, but ended up not wanting to pay any more for us.

"I remember vaguely the house my mom and I used to serve had so many secret storage rooms with paintings and arts. We'd spend hours cleaning everything up and hiding them inside something else, so the master can smuggle them. People would come to the place, too. I didn't really have much to do, so mom encouraged me to pick up strokes and paints, just start painting on the wall of our hut. It distracted me from everything else, the work and everything."

"What happened when you were nine?" Obi-Wan takes another sip on the drink, and realizes it's empty already. He puts the cup down, eyes not leaving the boy.

"The smuggler died in some art dealer auction, I don't know. Kitster said there was some fight or fire, because some bidder wasn't too happy. Then someone was coming to burn our house, too. Mom took me and we just ran away. It must be too much chaos at that time, so no one ever came after us. We hid in the dumpsters and all those deserted houses, and soon after, my mom passed away."

"How?"

Anakin frowns hard at his food, his fingers holding the buns too tight that the ingredient and sauces getting squeezed out from the other side and dripping to the plate, but he doesn't seem to care. "I don't know. Cold, hot, sick, starve, poor. Do you really need a reason to die in places like this?" He looks up at Obi-Wan, his eyes dark and miserable. Pain.

Obi-Wan reaches out intuitively to land a hand on his shoulder, squeezing slightly. Without himself knowing why he's doing this.

"I'm sorry," he says. It sounds so powerless and pale.

Obi-Wan tastes nothing but bitterness on tip of his tongue.

Anakin shakes his head again, wiping the corner of his eyes with the back of his hand, covering the motion with a bite on the food, chewing it carelessly. Obi-Wan lets his hand slip.

He should have ordered something a little stronger, for a conversation like this.

"Who raise you up then?" Obi-Wan can't help ask.

"Me." Anakin answers with a mouthful, then explaining it longer after swallowing the food down. "There were a few others like us. I ran with Kitster, then there was also Wald and Amee. Kitster is the oldest, two years older than me, Wald and Amee are younger. A few others joined later. So we were like the parent of ourselves, stealing food, picking pockets, scamming, begging, picking dumpsters, getting into trouble, going in and out of jail. Honestly, I have no idea how we managed to survive for so long."

Obi-Wan swallows hard. This is nothing like what he expected -- but he also has no idea what he *should* expect, about a life in the underworld. He knows no one from around here, after all. He hates himself for not knowing any of it any earlier, and that no one on the Upper Level seems to ever care -- not even when they were still in the Old Republic, not even when he was studying in the Jedi Academy.

"I'm sorry," he says again. He seems to use those three words quite a lot tonight. And every time, it's as pale as it already is.

Anakin almost looks amused at his words. "What are *you* sorry for? It's not like you made any of that happen."

Obi-Wan gives him a guilty look. "I didn't know."

"But you know what's the best that life taught me?" Anakin says. Obi-Wan answers with raised eyebrows, waiting for him to continue. "Freedom. With everything we *don't* have, freedom is one thing we have too much. We can always go wherever we want, do whatever we want. Believe it or not, I still get to paint. If I can't find paper, I paint on the wall. If no painting cans, well, there's always something you can find to mix and make some color yourself. That's one thing comforted me and make me think of mom. It's only later we find out what else we can do with the graffiti."

Obi-Wan looks at the boy, the artist, the rebel leader, the orphan who raised himself up. Words roll out of his tongue without permission: "You're amazing."

Anakin has an odd look on his face. "Are you... are you flirting? D... Don't."

"No, sorry, I mean," Obi-Wan stutters hastily. "I mean it, in a not weird way."

Anakin laughs. "I'm kidding. Thanks, man. Now, your turn."

He finishes the sandwich, cleaning his fingers on the greasy wrapping paper, and starts picking the fries.

"My turn?" Obi-Wan blinks blankly.

"It's story-sharing time, is it not?" Anakin says in a granted tone. "So, what's your story? Born in the palace, wear gold-thread dresses, served by twelve servants to eat your breakfast? Something like that?"

Obi-Wan bursts out a laughter. "That's how you imagined my life to be?"

Anakin shrugs humorlessly, but one side of his lips has a slight curve. "No, that's the fairy tale that I stopped believing since three. But still, you're a myth, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You come out of nowhere, you want to catch me, then you don't want to catch me. You work for the Empire, but then you're not *really* working for the Empire. I told you I have a really good intuition, and it's telling me you're one of the good guys. So I gave you a chance, now I just need to know, who are you?"

Obi-Wan thinks carefully for a minute before starting. And he tells the boy: "I was brought to the Jedi Temple at three, became a padawan at thirteen, a knight at twenty-five, the same time when my master died. That was to save the Queen of Naboo, and our ship was hit and crash-landed on Tatooine, but we had no way of getting a hyperdrive to fix it. We stuck there for three days, and a Sith Lord caught up with us. We fought, he killed my master, and I killed him. We managed to leave in his ship. That's the same year Emperor Palpatine was elected the chancellor. Then we went into the war, and I fought and became a general at that time. And you know the rest, three years later, we won the war, but all we got was the Empire."

He pauses to catch his breath. He never expects to tell someone his life story like that, and he certainly never think it's actually not even that long to tell. He waits, feeling a scratchy sensation under his chest, unsure of what Anakin would make of it. He might be less nervous when he's waiting for the announcement result of his Jedi tests.

Obi-Wan really wishes he has ordered something, or just anything, to distract himself.

Anakin dips a fry in some brown sauce and just keeps in that posture, forgetting to eat.

"Cool," Anakin says finally. Simply. One word, one syllable.

He picks the damp fry up and eats it.

Obi-Wan narrows his eyes, not knowing where that annoyance rises from: "That's it? Cool?"

Anakin blinks innocently. "I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of hearing 'It's freaking awesome and I want to learn all the sword fighting stuff', if you're waiting for it."

Obi-Wan huffs out a laugh, his tensed muscle relaxes. "I should know. But listen, would it go from 'Cool' to 'Super cool', if I start teaching you 'all the sword fighting stuff'?" He raises an expecting eyebrow.

Anakin completely forgets about his free food. "You would do that?"

Obi-Wan shrugs as an answer.

Light of excitement gleams in Anakin's eyes.

"You can get 'Super freaking cool', if you do that," he grins widely.

#### draft notes

Anakin's childhood flashback and Obi-Wan's flashback of losing Qui-Gon:

Anakin at 3y: he and Shmi were not sold to the Hutts and Watto in Tatooine during slave trade, instead, they were sold to an underground black market art smuggler in Coruscant. Ani started learning/having interest in art by watching/witnessing/helping out those art transactions, Shmi encouraged him to learn painting, it distracted him from slave life.

9y: The smuggler died in some art dealer auction conflict shortly and they were let go in chaos (no one cared about them, not realized they're gone). Shmi died shortly after due to some sickness, Anakin grew up alone (with other homeless orphan kids, e.g. Kitster Banai, Wald, Amee) in lower Coruscant, managed to survive on his own in the hard life, did a lot of small outlaw things to support himself, steal/rob/pick up dumpster to get food/money/everything, ran away from police a lot, get into trouble a lot, still try to make art (initially because it comforts him and make him think of mom, later find out more practical usage.)

Obi-Wan at 3y: brought to Jedi Temple, became a padawan at 13y, became a Jedi knight at 25y, now: 39y

ep1 timeline (32 BBY, Anakin 9y, Obi-Wan 25y), without Ani, Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan didn't go into pod racing bet, didn't get hyperdrive to fix ship, stuck in Tatooine, got caught up by Maul. Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan 2v1 fought Maul, Qui-Gon/Maul died, Padme/Obi-Wan went back to Coruscant in Maul's ship, Palpatine became chancellor. Coruscant was in the corrupted, late Republic stage.

ep2 timeline (22 BBY, Anakin 19y, Obi-Wan 35y), Palpatine started clone war (22BBY), had Jedi and senate all in control.

ep3 timeline (19 BBY, Anakin 22y, Obi-Wan 38y), Palpatine becomes emperor, all uncooperative Jedi were persecuted or went hiding (e.g. Yoda/Windu disappeared) (=canon Order 66 at 19 BBY), remaining Jedi mostly get brainwashed/forced to become Palpatine's personal police force. Without Anakin, Dooku is still alive so far, active in conducting Palpatine's orders.

current: 18 BBY (1y after Empire is announced, 4y after beginning of Clone Wars), Anakin 23y, Obi-Wan 39y

### Chap 6 (Grow/Slow burn)

> The two become popular among the group, come up with actual real attacking plans, Obi-Wan give them useful suggestion to actually do some real rebel fight against Empire's controlled troops/facilities (use graffiti as cover/breach/signal) and win, slowly turn to new leaders people willing to follow.
>
> Obi-Wan meanwhile acts as their double agent in Jedi and near Palpatine. They planned to wait until Anakin is ready to make the final move on Palpatine, but Obi-Wan is already suspected by Palpatine

They pack the unfinished food and Anakin drops it by a house. He insists Obi-Wan waits outside, so the Jedi doesn't push.

The boy gets out of the place in a good mood.

"How's the family?" Obi-Wan asks, knowingly.

Anakin doesn't ask how he knows. "A lot better," he answers, "and now also full. I told them it's from a friend."

Obi-Wan brightens up. "Am I a friend now?"

"Don't get too excited," Anakin says, hiding a small grin.

He starts heading to the other end of the town.

Obi-Wan follows. "Where are we going?"

"Working." The boy looks up at the ceiling of the Level, checking the brightness of the artificial light, presumably checking the time. "Unlike *somebody*, people here still need to do something useful."

"I'm working, too," Obi-Wan protests.

"Yes, by following me around. Lucky you," Anakin comments sarcastically.

"Believe me, it's not easy." Obi-Wan rebuts.

Anakin hums noncommittally.

They wind through a back alley way where the constant patrolling droids and troopers are out of sight almost all the time. And then go through an underground deserted pipe system where half the time they have to climb through the pipe on all fours, which eventually come out leading to the far inland of the Level.

Obi-Wan is pretty confident none of the people on the Upper Level would ever find out this passageway for a million years.

Anakin stops at the tail of a previous graffiti, and starts unpacking his bag to grab the cans.

Only now does Obi-Wan catches up what he's been talking about when he said "working."

"Leaving another message?" he probes.

"For tonight," Anakin checks the time again. "I should have left it sooner, it's your fault. Hope people would still come in."

"What's the message?"

"Same time, five o'clock, at the old shelter."

"What's wrong with that deserted factory I got caught out last time?"

"We can't always use the same place, are we? In case you guys find out."

"Can I paint it this time?" Obi-Wan asks, tentatively.

"What?" Anakin is surprised.

Obi-Wan says it again, "I only see you do it. I thought it must be fun."

He almost expects the boy to say no, but surprisingly, he just passes the can of cyan-colored paint over. "Why not? You know the code, you know the pattern. Just put it somewhere here. Make it bigger, so it's easier to see from the distance." Anakin points at a patch of bare wall. The wall surface is uneven, with grey falling-offs of the old paint and all kinds of sags and crests from a lack of maintenance.

Anakin takes a step back to let him work.

The paint can is metallic cold under his palm. And in his first try, Obi-Wan realize it's actually not as easy as it seems to be, to both hold down the press and control its trail at the same time. And no matter how hard he tries, he can't seem to draw a circle in the places he wants.

He holds out the can, chuckling awkwardly. "Okay I give up, I'm no artist, you are. Don't mind my dabbles. Think you can find a way to fix that?"

He doesn't expect a hand holds his from behind, and leads him to aiming at the right angle. The fingers are thin and a size smaller than his, but no less forceful. There is almost an electricity in the place where their skin touches. Obi-Wan inhales sharply in surprise.

"You're almost there," Anakin says, his voice coming close to Obi-Wan's ear, his breath blowing a loose bit of his hair.

Anakin's finger presses on the nozzle and leads his hand and arm to swing in a wide and bold curve. The spray comes out in a steady, elegant circle.

"There, see, you did it." The hand leaves just as quickly as it comes.

When Obi-Wan turns his head, the boy still stands about a foot away, holding his arms across his chest, as if nothing has happened, as if it all just happened in his head.

Obi-Wan checks him for a long second and looks at the graffiti again. Yes, it certainly just happened.

He struggles for something to say, then finally comes up with a simple "Thank you."

"Don't sound like I just saved your life or something," Anakin answers quickly, goes ahead to scrummage his bag and finds the other colors they'll need. "Though, at this speed, we probably can't finish the thing before the meeting start time."

Obi-Wan hands the can back and takes a step to the side, making a gesture to vacate the stage for the artist to start performing.

And he realizes, it is one thing to appreciate the art on the wall, and entirely another thing to watch it being created.

The colors are never just one layer of the color as they seem to be. Anakin switches the cans frequently, and layers the colors just so perfectly timed, so that the dryness of each layer is also so perfectly timed. And as it turns out, the boy is also quite talkative as he works. He talks through the meaning of each symbols, how they come up with the system, the color and design. Obi-Wan falls completely silent, just watching the art to grow like a fast-forwarded hologram of watching a flower growing from a seed, and watch the boy twists and turns his wrist to paint at the exact accurate places. It is as much of an art as a science and a workout. Sweat slowly gathers around his thin muscle.

Obi-Wan bites his lower lips, training his gaze move back to the wall.

Anakin announces it finished as he caps the cans. The pattern with the information looks similar as the other times, except for a little adjustment to note a different location. The full art, however, it's entirely something new. It's the night sky and the dark space with millions of shining stars and planets. But not quite like what they really look like in the deep space, it's the image that only exists in Anakin's head. The planets are vibrant, lively, spinning, taking the patch of space next to it rotating with it. The colors are intertwining together, one star is a mixture of blue and green, emitting a woodsy feeling; another burning red and orange, looking like the Mustafar system from Obi-Wan's knowledge; there's also one that's darker with rings, one shinier and looking all watery...

Obi-Wan is stunned at the art. Anakin seems to be amused by his reaction.

"Come on, tell me they're all wrong and stars don't really look like that," he says.

"No, they're not." Obi-Wan struggles to find his voice. Anakin's smile drops slightly. "They can't compare with this. They're not as astounding as what's in your vision. You really are a..." he can't find a word there.

"Genius?" Anakin supplies jokingly.

Obi-Wan considers, "For lack of a better word, certainly."

"You make me blush, old man." Anakin punches him on the shoulder. His handful of paint leaves a handprint on his shoulder.

Obi-Wan is snapped out of the stun. "Hey, I'm not that old," he protests, looking down at the handprint on the white jacket. "And don't blame me for ruining your jacket, you did it yourself."

The brat pointedly ignores the first refute and only answers the second. "You can keep it. It's a gift."

"For the lunch?"

"For everything."

Obi-Wan doesn't complain after that.

<br>

They are the first two arriving at the old shelter place they'll have the gathering later.

The place is smaller than the old factory.

"If you lured me here the first time, I'd have nowhere to hide," Obi-Wan observes.

"Then what's the fun?" Anakin remarks.

"So you *are* on purpose!" Obi-Wan accuses.

Anakin shrugs. "Thought you should have figured that out the first time."

Obi-Wan sighs. "You know, with your brain, it's a loss we didn't have you back when we were fighting the Clone War. We might win it a few years earlier."

"I must have lost my invitation letter by a few years," Anakin answers nonchalantly.

"Or by two decades," Obi-Wan replies.

"What's that supposed to mean?"

Obi-Wan hesitates.

"Obi-Wan?" Anakin turns to him fully now, alerted. "What do you mean?"

Obi-Wan bites his lips before answering, "The Force is strong with you. If we knew about you twenty years ago, you'd be trained as a Jedi."

"The Force?"

"It's what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It's everywhere. It's what binds the universe together. If you know how to sense it and harness it, it can do a lot of things."

"Like what?"

"You probably heard of Jedi mind tricks, there's also combat skills, moving things around, even healing. If only we still have old midi-chlorian testing device, I can have a reading on you to be sure. But the Emperor has destroyed every last one of it, saying it's illegal to test or train any new Jedi." Obi-Wan sighs heavily.

Anakin considers. "How do you know it's strong with me?"

"I don't know how to explain it, but I can just, *feel* it in you. It's what led me to notice you for the first time, and all the other times." Obi-Wan admits.

The light in Anakin's eyes dims. "Is that why you're so interested in me? Because I have some sort of psychic ability I don't know in me? And you just want to what, make me like one of you? Be like one of those pathetic Emperor's Henchman? Like what you used to be? Scratch that, like you still are! No, thank you! I must see it wrong on you!" He snaps furiously and turns his back on Obi-Wan.

"No! Of course not!" Obi-Wan says urgently, putting a hand on the boy's shoulder to steer him back to face him. "Listen to me, it's not that you're special *because* you have Force, it's that you're special *plus* you have Force. You said you have good intuition, and I call it the exact showing of the Force. Trust your intuition again then, am I lying to you? Am I trying to mean you any harm or utilize you in any way? You know you can feel it, then just use it, feel *me*."

Anakin glares at him in silent fury for a long, stretched moment. Obi-Wan's heart pounds heavily in his chest.

Then the boy closes his eyes and holds out a hand. His palm hovers before Obi-Wan but not touching.

Obi-Wan closes his eyes, too. In his mind's eyes, he sees lights and stars scattering in the space before him, flying around like the glowworms of the summer night in the woods of Naboo. He focuses on the lights and thinks, *Anakin, is that you? See me, meet me in the Force. Focus, Anakin.*

The little spots of light start gathering. Their movements are still too turbulent to form a shape.

Obi-Wan deliberately slows down his breathing, counting his heartbeat before each inhale and exhale. *Breathe, Anakin. Just breathe. Breathe in, and Breathe out slowly. You're talented. Just learn how to use it. You'll be the best among all of us.*

The sparks start settling down. If their movement has a sound, it must be quieting down from a thunderous roar to the sound of waves patting on the white sand -- still powerful, but so much quieter. Like the breathing of a massive, dominant creature.

*You're almost there, Anakin.*

The shape forms into the boy in the dark space.

The boy opens his eyes. Light shines dazzling bright around him like he's a deity from the fairy tales.

*Anakin.* Obi-Wan calls to him through the Force. Joy and pride fills his heart so full that he thinks he might be floating.

*Obi-Wan?* The light shifts slightly as the sound comes through, the shape breaks as his attention sways, but just a short moment later, Anakin keeps himself in focus again.

*You did it.* Obi-Wan praise him generously. *I've never seen anyone master it faster than you do.*

It's then that Obi-Wan feels the palm touches his chest, physically and mentally, pressing right over his heart. His heartbeat picks up temporarily just from the touch, his mind's eyes blur for a second when he's distracted. But Obi-Wan demands his attention back, to the sensation itself, to the existence itself, to the world and life itself.

The skin on the boy's hand is colder than his, leaving a chilly sensation seeping through the ribcage, deeper inside. The light sparks in the spiritual realm, however, is so much more heated, so much more electrical. Anakin's light reaches out to Obi-Wan, mingles with the light that was his own but now disturbed. For a time, they can't tell apart whose is whose, it's as if their mind are also melting as one, resonating like a same tune.

Anakin is searching his memory and thought, Obi-Wan realizes. It's similar to mind trick, inserting a thought into a weak-minded, but this is so much more intense. When he invites Anakin to try it, he doesn't really think the boy is able to have a grasp of it in the first try. He certainly underestimated his talent and power.

Anakin scrummages his thought like searching for a book in a library. There is no privacy here, but luckily, Obi-Wan considers himself an open book to read. He already admitted all the worst things he's done -- he witnessed his master's death, he murdered a Sith -- he's been completely frank with Anakin all these times, so, yes, Anakin can poke all he wants and he'll find exactly what he's told.

Obi-Wan counts his breath and his heartbeat, going back to a calm meditating state, waiting for Anakin to finish.

The touch leaves him, so is the light in the spiritual realm.

Anakin staggers two steps back, pressing his palm over his heart. He breathes heavily.

Obi-Wan intuitively takes a step toward him, wanting to steady him. "Are you alright, Anakin? Is it too much?"

Anakin takes another quick step back, leaning away from him. Obi-Wan stills in his place, letting the hold-out hands fall back next to him.

When Anakin meets his eyes again, the look in those eyes are strange to him. Curious, unbelievable, wondrous, odd. Obi-Wan can't help wondering what Anakin has seen in those barest, frankest moment.

"So?" Obi-Wan waits for a long moment before he has to pick up the conversation again. "How do you feel? What did you find?"

Anakin puts his hand back down his side. He swallows. "You didn't lie to me," he says, in a tone that sounds like he's trying really hard to put himself together. "And you didn't try to make me like one of you. You only really just wish to teach me, how to master it, to be a better me, I guess."

Obi-Wan smiles faintly. "If you let me."

"Okay, then." Anakin nods quietly.

<br>

When people start coming in, they are right in the middle of a round of sword fighting and training.

Obi-Wan taught him how to properly hold the stick -- of course they'll start with stick -- how to adjust his stance for both attacking and defending, how to move to dodge, how to duck, how to attack. Anakin is absolutely the fastest learner he's ever seen.

And right now, they're going through a mock match.

"Don't hold back when you try to hit me," Anakin has said.

"Are you sure?" Even with his talent and his level of Force, there is he can beat Obi-Wan after two-hour of training, is he? Obi-Wan sincerely considers if it counts as child-abuse -- okay, he's already a grown man age, but he's still like a kid in his eyes.

But he can see the boy is determined. "Don't regret it," he warns him, and then the fight starts getting brutal.

Anakin is nimble and creative; he moves fast and unconventionally; there is practically no way of predicting where his next blow is. Even Obi-Wan has to pull up all his attention to make his defense impermeable. He manages to keep the blow and attacks at six-inch's range. Whatever Anakin tries, he can't even get any closer to him. The boy is visibly getting impatient, and his moves are reckless and careless.

"You'll lose if you keep doing that." Obi-Wan finds a gap in his move and swings the wooden stick at him. It hits the boy at the waist.

"This is how you got cut in half," Obi-Wan comments, retracting his stick, dancing around to enlarge their distance, giving both of them a moment to breathe.

"Is this how you kill that Sith Lord?" Anakin stares at him with wolf-like eyes. He looks like a predator locking his eyes on his prey. His eyes are sharp and almost murderous. The bare sharpness and coldness in them make Obi-Wan shiver in uneasiness. It's the brutal dark side that he hasn't seen, or he'd noticed but rather not seeing.

"It is," Obi-Wan answers plainly. A sharp blow of wind comes straight to his face at the split second of his distraction because of the conversation. Obi-Wan has to jump back in a large startled jump to prevent that stick from striking through his skull.

He doesn't land in the most elegant stance.

"Are you trying to kill me, Anakin?" Obi-Wan snaps, steadying himself.

"I thought you're more difficult to kill," Anakin answers, grinning with teeth.

Obi-Wan rolls his eyes. "Why do I have the feeling you'll be the death of me?"

Anakin swipes his stick again toward Obi-Wan from the side, "Are you going to talk me to lost or actually try to hit me?"

This time, Obi-Wan is prepared, knowing full well the conversation is becoming part of the distraction strategy, he blocks it before it even reaches his arm's range.

"You can't use the same trick twice, it would look old," Obi-Wan comments. "They'll see it coming."

"Or maybe they'll *think* they can see it coming --" Anakin pauses at half-sentence, circling to his back.

Obi-Wan waits for the rest of the sentence to come, but instead, it's a fist that falls on his back. He staggers forward for a step. The crowd cheers.

"That's cheating!" Obi-Wan complains loudly, turning sharply and poking the stick forward at the same time.

Expecting it to land nowhere but instead, it stabs right onto a body, the counterforce even surprises Obi-Wan. He hears a loud gasp before realizing what must have happened. He lets go of the stick immediately.

Anakin covers his shoulder with one hand where the stick sank in, blood dripping between his fingers.

"Oh God," one of the surrounding people gasps again. More rush toward him to help his swaying feet to stand still.

"No, no, no, I'm sorry!" Obi-Wan hurriedly moves toward him.

Someone blocks him with spread arms, snapping at his face. "I think you've done enough! What are you still here for?!"

"Kitster," Anakin's voice passes through the crowd tiredly. "Take it easy. He doesn't mean it. I told him to hit me with everything."

Kitster glares at Obi-Wan menacingly one more moment before stepping aside.

Anakin has sit down now, and the people around him is trying to figure out how deep the stick has pierced through his shoulder, and how bad the damage is. He looks up and tries to pull a tired smile when Obi-Wan gets to him. More sweat gather on his forehead as he tries to grit his teeth at the pain.

"I can fix it," Obi-Wan offers. The crowd stares at him in distrust. "Remember I told you the Force can heal, too? It's also true. But fair warning, I'm not the best in my healing class."

Anakin nods small, teeth clenched too tight to speak. He slowly removes his bloody hand on the wound.

The stick is just a random thing they improvised to find in the place. The end that stabbed into him is surprisingly sharp, but on the brighter side, the tearing wound is confined.

Obi-Wan keeps one hand on his shoulder, another on the sticking-out part. "On the count of three," he tells him. Anakin nods again.

"One --" he pulls the stick out already, quickly covering the opening wound with his hand, and closes his eyes to focus on the Force. It's not easy. With everything that just happened, with the warm, wet, sticky blood gurgling under his palm, with the rusty iron smell permeating in the air, the pressure from the eyes of everyone in the room, and the knowledge and pressure that if he can't do this, Anakin might be hurt really bad, it's almost impossible to concentrate on the Force around him.

That's when he feels a hand loosely fall around his wrist, and a whisper saying his name: "I believe you, Obi-Wan."

His own heartbeat steadies at the voice. He channels the Force around them onto the wounded structure. *The Force is every living cell, every life, everywhere.* He reminds himself, reciting it like a spell, willing his mind's eyes to see the cells that were broken, and see the Force flowing in and out of them.

He guides the Force through them and fixes them.

When Obi-Wan opens his eyes again, the skin under his palm has knitted together like new.

Anakin exercises that side of his shoulder, swinging it like nothing has happened. "Wow," he says, admiring tone, "you need to teach me that too."

"I'm trying to not have to use it too much," Obi-Wan says with a bitter smile.

"But I bet you wanted to do that since the first day we met, didn't you?" Anakin says deliberately. "That's revenge, I'm sure of it."

"Didn't you just try to do exactly that too?" Obi-Wan wrings a hand to his back, rubbing the place where Anakin's fist has landed heavily on. He's sure there will be a bruise sooner or later. But he doesn't bother spending more effort to heal himself. He can use a little reminder of their little fighting game for a while longer.

"Call it even then," Anakin says cheerfully, pulling himself up from the chair, walking toward the front of the crowd.

They still have a full, long, routine meeting to have, and all those people to help. Anakin falls back into that rare leader role that Obi-Wan hasn't get used to seeing. He goes ahead to discuss all the issues people bringing with and needing help with, and most importantly, to discuss about a "Plan." Obi-Wan just listens quietly at the outer rim of the crowd.

"We have information that we must act quickly and strike hard; time is running out." Anakin paces slightly at the front of the room. "I think we'll have change our strategy. We don't have time to strike small and build up our force slowly."

"Where is the information from? Is it reliable?" Kitster raises his hand.

"Yes," Anakin answers, casting a look at the end of the crowd, meeting Obi-Wan's eyes. "I trust him. And if you trust me, you'll trust him, too."

Kitster slowly puts his hand down, unconvinced, but doesn't question.

"We *must* strike the main target on the first go, and we *must* get what we want. We can't afford to fail," Anakin says in a determined tone.

Obi-Wan wonders what exactly that "main target" and "what they want" are.

"Luckily, we have all the inside information we'll ever need." Anakin raises his voice.

Obi-Wan realizes all the eyes are landed on him now. He walks toward Anakin through the passageway among people that they vacated out for him.

"Now, tell us all the ways in and out of the Imperial Palace, and where to find the Emperor?"

<br>

Anakin stares into his eyes, demanding.

Obi-Wan glares back at him. "This is madness!" he exclaims, taking a large step back, putting an extra foot's distance between him and the reckless boy. "So what, you're just going to march into the Palace and go straight to see the Emperor? Forget about how *impossible* this is, how is that even going to help with anything?"

"We'll negotiate with him," Anakin answers calmly.

"*Negotiate*," Obi-Wan parrots coldly, huffing a loud humorless laugh. He rubs his temple exhaustedly. "Do you have any idea how idiotically innocent and political ignorant that is? He's the Emperor! For someone like him, he's not going to *negotiate* with you if you don't have any bargaining chip. What do you have? Tell me, what do we have?"

"You let us worry about that," Anakin does not flinch under his incredulous eyes.

Their staring match continues adding tense to the air.

"Do you have any back up plan if *negotiation* fails?"

"Yes. We call it aggressive negotiation."

Obi-Wan blinks. "Assassination? That's what's in your mind?" He breaks the gaze to scan around them, meeting eyes with same desperate, determined looks. "In all of your minds? Holy, you really are a terrorist group."

Anakin's eyes narrow. "Now, are you with me, or against me?"

"I can't," Obi-Wan says, slowly, painfully.

"Can't or won't?" Anakin demands.

"I won't! Alright? It's impossible. I won't help you suicide!" He turns away, walking fast toward the exit.

"What's the difference? We're already dying a little every day. You're still just letting us die, just slower!" Anakin raises his voice behind him.

Obi-Wan doesn't slow his steps.

"We shouldn't let him go, he will report us in." Kitster's voice stands out in the crowd's sudden raising murmur.

"He just needs some time." Obi-Wan hears Anakin answer.

### Chap 6.5 (Slow burn/plan)

> Obi-Wan faces choice again, whether to help them make assassination plan, he has struggles, but eventually makes the final decision to help them. There's no going back.
>
> Obi-Wan gives Anakin necessary information that they'll need later to infiltrate the Palace to find Palpatine.
>
> Obi-Wan meanwhile acts as their double agent in Jedi and near Palpatine. They planned to wait until Anakin is ready to make the final move on Palpatine, but Obi-Wan is already suspected by Palpatine

Obi-Wan drifts on the street mindlessly, not knowing where his feet is leading him.

The artificial sky is getting darker. The night is coming closer.

People on the street pick up steps, rushing toward their houses -- or shelter, or wherever they call it home to pass the night.

His feet bring him to the familiar diner he's been in just a few hours ago.

Dex is the only one in the place this time. His four hands are organizing the counter and kitchen supplies, tidying things up, about to close the place for the night. His move pauses when Obi-Wan walks in.

"Craving for a burger before you go upstairs?" Dex pushes the empty plates aside, grabbing two new cans of Jawa Juice, walks out from behind the counter. "Afraid the kitchen is closed, but I can make an exception if you need."

"No, just need a place to sit for a while." Obi-Wan seats himself in the closest booth, not bothering to check if the table is clean, leaning his arm on it tiredly.

Dex pushes one can before him, and sits on the opposite side. "Had a fight with that kid?"

Obi-Wan raises his eyebrows. "How do you know? Is that this obvious?"

"Five hours ago the two of you ordered half the kitchen's food and chatted non-stoppingly. And now you came back alone with a long face. It's not so difficult to put two and two together." Dex pulls open his drink and pours it into his mouth, the other lower hand scratching his back carelessly.

Obi-Wan isn't even in the mood for Jawa Juice now. He just sighs in frustration. "I might have made a stupid mistake," he says.

"Falling in love?" Dex supplies.

"What?! No!" Obi-Wan almost jumps, shifting his attention to his old friend with widened eyes. "What gives you that idea?! He's just a little brat I happened to run into three days ago, and now it's becoming a huge mess."

"That so? If it's so simple, then why are you just sitting in my place, sulking and bitching, instead of going back to that golden palace and report him in? You won't lose anything, maybe even a metal for capturing the wanted. Bob's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt. Things go back to normal, you should be happy." Dex puts down the can and stares into his eyes.

Obi-Wan looks away. "I..." he wets his lips, struggling with words. "I don't know." He admits helplessly, pondering slowly.

"He's different, special, so talented with Force. I haven't seen anyone with Force for so long now, let alone so strong. I just thought maybe there's still hope for us, you know, to make a change in some way." He stares at the diner floor, out of focus, remembering those blue eyes staring back at him, reckless, determined.

"Isn't that exactly what he's been trying to do? Make a change?" Dex offers.

"You know? His plan?" Obi-Wan is surprised, scanning his friend's face.

Dex shrugs. "Most people around here know. How do you think he gets so many to follow him around, learn his secret art code, go to the meetings? Hope is an awful thing, I'm telling you. He gives it to people, and now, they can't live without."

Obi-Wan finds himself speechless once again. "And they all trust him, believe it's the right thing to do," he murmurs, remembering how he helps the starving family, the sick kid, the helpless old men and women in the group. They go to him for advice, for support, and he gives them something so much better than food and medicine -- he gives them hope. The hope of a tomorrow that they can live in freedom and prosperity, in democracy and republic, in a world better than the current one. In a world without the darkness created by the Emperor.

"I need to think," Obi-Wan stands up.

"Maybe you should stop thinking," Dex doesn't bother standing up to see him out, just staying in his seat. "Follow your feelings, Obi-Wan. Qui-Gon always say, follow your feelings."

He's answered with a sound of the diner's door clang shut.

<br>

When the night-time galaxy-wise broadcast starts, Obi-Wan finds himself go back to the wall painting Anakin showed him earlier. The wall covered by the massive colorful wings. The colors look dimmer in the night-time lighting, but the memory of them is still fresh enough to compensate.

Obi-Wan sits before the wall, legs crossed, in his usual meditation posture. He can see Force flowing around the wall and painting just as it flows around Anakin. He asks the Force quietly, *What should I do? What's the right thing?*

And then, the broadcasting starts. There is no public screen in this part of the town, but the sound still pierces through. Emperor's voice vibrates in the air as if it carries real electricity. As if saying, in all the corner of all the galaxy, as long as his image can be sent to, as long as his voice can touch, it is under his govern.

Free expression of art -- forbidden. Free assembly -- forbidden. Ill discussion of the Emperor -- arrest. Grudge against the system -- arrest. Leave house after curfew -- arrest.

It can almost get simplified into: Do anything anyone upstairs isn't happy about -- death.

Obi-Wan swipes his face with his hands desperately.

Images and colors flash before his eyes on their own accord.

Blue -- Anakin's eyes.

Red -- the lightsaber of that nameless Sith who killed his master.

White -- the Imperial Palace.

Blue -- the sky's real color, above the ground.

Red -- blood coming out of the fatal wounds of so many people, his master, his comrades, the friends he used to have.

Black -- the armor and the Imperial symbol on their shoulders.

Blue -- his own lightsaber.

Red -- the fire that burns the bodies of those who died, and soon, forgotten. But Obi-Wan never really forgets them.

Blue -- his own eyes looking back through mirrors, tired, aged, muted, in the age when his voice can no longer be heard or expressed safely.

Red -- the draping cloak over Count Dooku's shoulder, following his steps.

Blue -- the freedom, the safety, the prosperity, the happiness, the hope, the life.

Red -- the blood, the fire, the prison, the power, the death.

Anakin's voice starts echoing in his head.

*We're already dying a little every day. You're still just letting us die, just slower!*

*I can fly now.*

*With everything we don't have, freedom is one thing we can still have.*

Then Dex's voice chimes in unreasonably.

*Follow your feelings.*

*I might have made a stupid mistake. -- Falling in love?*

*If it's so simple, why are you still here?*

It really should be a simple question -- it shouldn't even *be* a question at all. The code is clear, the order is clear. The wanted warrant is making it even more easy. He has everything he needs, the people, the proof, the idea of a destructive plan, the evil rebellious intention. He has everything.

*What are you still debating about, Obi-Wan?* The voices in his head speak louder and louder. Now sounds like his own, but mixed with everything and everyone from his past and his memory.

*What are you so afraid to see?* They push, and press, and march, and besiege.

"Stop," Obi-Wan tells the voices, feeling himself cornered. "Stop!"

One of the voices stands out to answer him, clear and young, "If you yell any louder, the droid patrol on the main street might hear you and come over."

Obi-Wan snaps open his eyes.

Three steps away, Anakin stands with his arms crossed. His backpack at his feet.

Obi-Wan wipes his face hastily to school his expressions, but what's the point, Anakin already sees his miserable look anyway.

"How do you know I'm here?" he asks, uncrossing his folded legs, standing up from the ground.

"Lucky guess," Anakin answers stoically, without looking at him. He holds out an arm, in a gesture to hand his bag over. "Just thought you might want your armor back, that's all. They might give you trouble if you lost them."

Obi-Wan takes the bag from him but doesn't hurry to open, just let it sit by his feet. "Why do you care?" he asks quietly.

"It doesn't matter now," Anakin says plainly, putting his hands in his pockets, about to turn to leave. "You do what you do, we do what we do. You want to report me or arrest me, that's your duty, I don't blame you. If I get killed by that, I die from my own stupidity of trusting the wrong guy. I deserve that." His tone is kept stiffly flat, emotionless, defeated. His face half hidden in the shadow.

Obi-Wan blinks hard. He bursts out, "Four entrances."

"Sorry?" Anakin jerks up his head.

"The Palace, it has two maintenance and service entrances in the lower floors. But if you count the sewage and exhaust system, there are four." Obi-Wan says breathlessly, as if trying to rush them out before his own brain betrays him.

Anakin looks at him for a long second, the muscle around his jaw starting to slack. He moves closer, slowly. His eyes hold Obi-Wan's, neither of them blink. "Where are they?"

"I need some paper."

"In the bag."

<br>

The drawing is almost like a doodle, but Obi-Wan already tried his best.

He glances at Anakin apologetically. "Sorry, I'm not as good as you in terms of painting."

"I noticed," Anakin answers, still regarding the drawing. The palace is represented by a rough shape of triangle combined with some rectangles. The pipe systems and each of the entrances are marked in red. The elevator and corridors are verbally explained by Obi-Wan, and Anakin memorizes them. The Emperor's chamber is near the very top.

"I could try to give you a floor plan from the archive." Obi-Wan's finger lingers on his personal datapad from outside the pocket. "But I'd guess they'll notice as soon as I requested, might even trigger some alarm or something similar. We probably don't want to risk it."

"We?" Anakin tilts his head toward him. His face, under the dim light, looks all bright and sunshine.

"In for a penny, in for a pound," Obi-Wan answers easily.

"Thought you said it yourself, you do this, we'll all likely be killed," Anakin says.

"What's better to die for than fighting for freedom?"

"You really sound like one of us now." Anakin smiles.

"As long as it doesn't require me to paint on that wall, I'm all in," Obi-Wan jokes, feeling his heart lifted.

Anakin shoves his shoulder playfully. "That's the easy part, we can train you."

Obi-Wan straightens his face again, "Besides, with me helping from the inside, we might actually have a chance to win."

"We'll need a more detailed plan. I'll call in a meeting tomorrow to go over everything we have, to get people ready. We might need another week to get everyone enough weapon and ammunition." Anakin starts packing things up.

"And I'll go back to see if there's any change in the Palace, if anyone raises suspicion. I'll let you know once I'm back." Obi-Wan puts on his imperial armor again, over the jacket Anakin lent -- no, gifted -- him. The armor is cold and rigid, uncomfortable to wear, even worse to move around with. Obi-Wan buckles it up in silence. Anakin helps with over his shoulder on his back.

"You know where to find the meeting information." Anakin throws the bag onto his bag. "I'll see you tomorrow."

"That's a date," Obi-Wan answers without thinking, examining his wearing one last time. He lifts his head to find Anakin's amused, raised eyebrows. Hastily, he amends, "Not what you're thinking. I mean like, that's deal." His cheeks burn slightly.

"I'm not thinking anything," Anakin chuckles. "I don't know *who* is thinking."

He leaves just as quietly as he appears, dissolving into the dark shadow like a color melting into the painting.

Obi-Wan looks at the way he disappears, staring into the darkness for a minute too long, before heading out as well.

<br>

But his chamber is not empty. Nor is it locked.

Obi-Wan reaches for his lightsaber before he pushes it open cautiously.

He doesn't need to see the face to recognize that long and dark silhouette standing before the window.

And he also doesn't even have a chance to click his lightsaber to life, before a strong shot of electricity has knocked him out from the behind.

The last thing he sees, is the Count turning to him with his hand held behind his back, an unfathomable look dangling on his face.

The world falls into black a blink of an eye later.

<br>

### Chap 7 (Revolution)

> Obi-Wan gets captured/tortured/interrogated, very close to be prosecuted (charge of traitorous/treason), know there is info leak (graffiti encoding meaning is leaked, someone from inside might get turned, has rat; or Obi-Wan's personal datapad is monitored without him knowing, his photos of Anakin/graffiti/decoder sheet are found out), know rebels are in danger (Dooku is tasked to kill them all).
>
> They all are forced to start the revolution movement earlier than planned, jump-start full-on revolution, Obi-Wan/Anakin in lead.
>
> Anakin go into Imperial Palace with the group, has disagreement within team of whether the goal is mainly to rescue Obi-Wan or assassinate Palpatine, Anakin faces the option of either killing Palpatine or saving Obi-Wan, and chooses Obi-Wan, gets himself in danger (run into Dooku, fight, get his right hand cut, like canon).

Obi-Wan wakes up to a dimly lit chamber inside confinement ray, his wrists and ankles locked into position by the ray, his neck and back sore from keeping the body together. The only thing he can move is his eyes.

Someone stands just outside the peripheral of his eyes.

"What's this about, Count Dooku?" Obi-Wan takes a guess and is proved right.

The man walks into his view, wearing a facsimile of a mocking smile. "Obi-Wan Kenobi," he speaks in a lazy tone, his voice echoing through the claustrophobic space. Obi-Wan tries to figure out the size and possible location of this chamber just from the sound. "I knew you must be planning something, but I didn't think you would be idiotic enough to show up again."

Obi-Wan thinks fast. He doesn't think he left any trace or got followed, they don't have any proof. The Count must just try to intimidate him into spilling out the secrets. It's nothing more than a interrogation trick, and he wouldn't be fooled by that.

He puts on an innocent face. "I don't know what you're talking about," Obi-Wan answers in a calm voice.

"Oh really?" Dooku mocks. "So you're saying you didn't spend the past *weeks* looking for the wanted, keeping in touch with them, deciphering their code in the scribbles on the wall, and joining their meetings?"

Obi-Wan's heart sinks, temperature dropping from his face. No way they get to guess all that just from nothing. The first thought comes to him is that they're betrayed from inside, fury and anger starting to burn inside him. Anakin trusts all those people, and half the Lower Level knows his plan. It can be anyone, and they are probably still right there, hiding in the crowd, joining the meetings like they're just one of them, all the while sharing all the information to Palpatine.

Obi-Wan freezes. Anakin will be in danger if he discusses his plan and starts attacking like that. The Palace will be prepared for him. The secret entrances will be guarded.

He grimaces, not wanting to think about what would happen after. But the image of the familiar horror from the battlefield, win or lose, is already rushing toward him like a tsunami wave, and the figures and bodies in those visions, are replaced by his new friends and those people he just started to know.

Dooku studies his look closely. "Yes, Obi-Wan, we know, we know everything." He stretches each syllable and each word, as if each of them is physical, tangible, and he can stretch them into a rope to bind Obi-Wan round and round again. "It's foolish of you to even think we wouldn't find out."

"How?" Obi-Wan spits, not bothering to pretend anymore. His expression has probably already given away the admission anyway. But no way he wouldn't try to get some intel if he has to go through this. "Someone tipped you off?"

Dooku walks around him, studying him from one side to the other, like a researcher studying his object. "You might say so."

The worst suspicion is confirmed. *He needs to warn Anakin,* Obi-Wan thinks. *He needs to get out of here before they come in. He needs to save them.*

"I would worry about yourself first if I were you," Dooku comments.

"You're reading my mind?" The horrifying thought strikes Obi-Wan. He takes a second to consider the possibility -- Yes, that's definitely possible. He has to focus hard to try to put up a wall in his head.

"I don't need to." Dooku informs him with a sound of satisfaction under his tone. "Just look at you. You're writing everything on your face."

Obi-Wan sets his jaw tight, not answering.

Dooku takes a turn when he reaches the other side, moving back to stand right in front of him.

Obi-Wan is hanged higher above the ground, having to drop his eyes to keep the Count in his vision. He glares at the man, but Dooku doesn't seem to notice.

"Now, chat time is over. It's Question and Answer time," Dooku announces. "You can make it easy, or play tough and loyal, and make it difficult. It's your choice. But either way, I will get the answer. Are we clear?"

Obi-Wan just glares at him harder, as his answer.

"Where are the rebels?" Dooku asks, almost in a kind and gentle tone.

"I don't know," Obi-Wan says.

"So we're doing this the hard way, I see." Dooku says lazily, walking out of his sight. Obi-Wan hears the ticks of a machine nearby.

A few ticking sound, like one tunes the knob on an old device, and the beams arounds him start heating up. The forces around his hands and legs are contracting, menacing to tear his body up.

"Shall we try that again? Where are the rebels? What are they planning to do?" Dooku demands.

Obi-Wan can feel heat and burning sensation starts accumulating on his skin. It's different from pure temperature increasing, there must be something else in the ray, enlarging the sensibility of his sensations. He can feel the electricity in the ray, piercing through his skin like thinnest needles, biting his bone like countless ants eating him up from inside. His heart contracts reflexively in fear.

"I don't know!" Obi-Wan clenches his teeth to bear the sensation. It's more than just pain. It's as if all the sensors in his body have been triggered to be used against his brain. His brain is too confused to parse them, too distracted to keep up the wall and attention. Obi-Wan closes his eyes to fight against it.

"Well, well, looks like it's going to be a long day." Dooku says, turning the knobs again. More heat, more needles, more electricity. More pain. "Just remember, everyone has a breaking point, sooner or later, your body will give up, so is your mind. I can wait until then."

Obi-Wan thinks miserably, *He might have to miss the meeting with Anakin now. The boy might be disappointed.*

<br>

Anakin is pacing up and down the old factory floor impatiently.

It's already an hour after the scheduled meeting time, and Obi-Wan still hasn't showed up.

"He's probably not coming, Ani. We should start," Amee suggests nervously.

"He will. He might just, I don't know, get caught up in the middle of something," Anakin answers fretfully. "He promised he would come."

"Have you ever considered maybe he's betrayed us? Tipped us off and he's just waiting for us to rush into the traps right about now?" Kitster says loudly.

"No," Anakin says decisively. "He's not like that."

"Because those imperial hatchet men are so trustworthy," Kitster remarks sourly.

Anakin strides to his face in two large steps, raising his fist, growling irritably, "I told you, if you trust me, then you can trust him!" His fists don't missed Kitster's face because Wald drags him away.

"Something must happened when he went back last night," Anakin glances upward, as if wishing to see what happened up there just from where he stands.

"Can you sense him through the Force? Or whatever that magical thing you guys were trying the other day?" Amee says, unsure of herself.

Anakin pauses in his pacing. It never occurred to him. "I don't know if I can," he hesitates. "I only did that once when he was here."

"No harm to try it again," Amee encourages.

Anakin nods and sits down on the ground with crossed legs. He closes his eyes.

The vision behind the closed eyelids is pure black at first. Empty. Nothing.

"I don't think it's working." Anakin shifts in his position uncomfortably.

"Focus, Ani. If he's in trouble, maybe this is the only way we can find out what happened." Amee says. "He'll need our help -- your help."

*Obi-Wan needs me.* That specific thought clears the mind of all the other noises and drifting thoughts. The vision brightens up, as if he finally manages to open the eyes that he's always kept closed. It's still vague, like looking at a painting from across the street through the heaviest fog. But the shapes and colors are forming.

*Obi-Wan!* Anakin tries to move toward the shapes. But the shapes are moving too, leaving him like a floating paper ship on the rapid stream, like a dream ready to wake up.

The color turns red around him. Like blood, like flame, thick and sluggish, smelling of rusty iron.

Voices start coming through. Some laughter, deep and cold, snaky and uncomfortable; more yells of pain, through clenched teeth, through broken bones.

He senses pain, worry, and a touch of fear, like sensing a coming storm at the edge of the sky; he senses guilt and regret, like sensing the coming of a high wave from a roaring sea. And there is something else, like a turbulence under the current, a fluster in the wind, a sprout showing in the middle of a winter, untimely, delicate, and utterly different from everything else that's rushing around in the Force. It's like a calling, so strong that it's pulling him step deeper and closer. So he trudges through the foggy red and black, moving through the pain and yelling. There, in the deep and afar, he sees -- no, he feels -- the color of blue. Faint and pale that it's almost turning into white, but it's a hint of blue, like the color of Obi-Wan's eyes. It doesn't make sense, but it's also all starting to make sense now.

Anakin snaps open his eyes. "They captured him." He jumps to his feet. "We have to go now. To save him."

"What? Now?" Kitster is alarmed.

"Yes! Now!" Anakin snaps.

"How do you know? That they captured him? Did you see that?" Amee asks cautiously.

Anakin shakes his head. "I felt it. There are all these feelings and colors. I can't see exactly. But I can feel it."

"What if it's a trap?" Kitster says suspiciously.

"Do you know where?" Amee asks at the same time.

"Imperial Palace, I think," Anakin pauses for a second. "I hope." Even he has to admit that's weak.

"I take it 'hope' is all we can get now." Kitster sighs. "What about the plan? The weapons? The training? We didn't expect to take the action so soon. We're not ready. Hell, even you're not ready. Obi-Wan said you should have more training."

"Well, we didn't expect him to be captured, did we?" Anakin counters.

Kitster frowns at him, folding his arms. "The mission, are we talking about carrying on with the, you know, aggressive negotiation, or rescue? We never really considered we'll have to do a rescue."

Anakin swallows. "Now we do."

"We don't have enough people, or enough anything, to pull one mission off, let alone two. We'll have to choose," Kitster points out sharply. "When the time comes, you'll have to decide if you want to save him, or do what all of us always wanted, for the best of everyone. Don't make the wrong choice, Anakin!"

Anakin clenches his jaw. "We'll see when the time comes. Now, take what we have. Let's go."

<br>

### Chap 8 (Mutual Rescue)

> It turns out Obi-Wan manage to escape on his own (wounded but nonfatal), ready to leave to warn them, come back to rescue Anakin, the two kill Dooku. Obi-Wan uses Force heal to stabilize Anakin's handicapped hand, Anakin furious, desperate, fear can't paint again. Obi-Wan suggests retreat for now, Anakin insists see it through, now or never.

This is the first time many of them ever come to above the Ground Level. The sky is a deep purple canopy, close to black, but different from what they used to see in the Lower Level -- it's real. All the buildings are as tall and straight as towers soaring toward the sky. Speeders and shuttles fly above their heads, busy across the city. Lights from the skyscrapers and moving vehicles are as bright as the stars, let alone all the blinding electrical screens and commercials playing in loop. They have to blink to adjust the level of the lightings.

It's close to the broadcasting hour now. And soon it will be curfew. People must be hurrying to home, if they have to guess. But the city is still more busy and vibrant than the Lower Level ever is.

On the brighter side, it gives them perfect cover to move around.

Though, Anakin has to remind the group to focus.

"Stop staring," he warns them, "we're not here for sightseeing, we have a job to do."

Amee closes her gaping mouth. And Wald has to really make an effort to tear his eyes away from the buildings. Kitster, however, is dedicated, moving toward the tallest, brightest building in the distance -- the Imperial Palace, without giving this life that doesn't belong to them a second look. Anakin rushes right next to him, not daring to waste any time.

They find a row of parked speeders at the foot of a restaurant, and Anakin "borrows" them. The group -- it's a dozen of them, all the fitting age, men and women -- splits into several vehicles to head toward the Palace.

The lighting and architecture of the Palace looks more intimidating as they move closer. It towers above the ground, making the buildings around it look low and invisible. It's golden exterior must look more astounding under the day light.

The Palace is more like a fortress than a palace, Anakin realizes. The name is a little misleading.

The regular rectangular shape of its base means every side would be equally difficult to approach, and like Obi-Wan warned them, impossible to get close without being noticed by the patrols.

Anakin tries to figure out the location of the sewage outlet Obi-Wan drew him on that scratch.

"We need some distractions," he murmurs.

Wald jumps to volunteer. "On it."

"Careful," Anakin urges, before he moves away from the group.

The ground shakes when the explosion breaks out at the foot of the Palace. The emergency alarm rings out, and the troopers rush to the explosion point. But it's not a bomb, but an exploded painting can. The colors outburst from the explosion and splash on the outer wall, marking the neat exterior with rainbow color. The tiny black dot that must be Wald stands in the bare ground, shooting paints from his painting gun, writing a message on the wall that they can see even from the distance -- he starts with the first stroke of the letter "F".

"Now!" Anakin commands, and leads the team to charge toward the opposite side of the Palace that is now clear of the patrol.

They find the sewage outlet and climb in, moving through the draining pipe, shifting to the exhaust pipe once they reach the closest crossing point. The alarm from the outside is quieter now.

Each level of the Palace is guarded, more droids and armed troopers patrolling along the otherwise quiet corridors.

"We have to split," Anakin whispers under his breath. The place is too big, and it's only a matter of time someone from the inside realizes the break-in. "I don't know where the interrogation room is."

"But we know where the throne room is," Kitster says, also trying to keep his low, but his tone is sharp. "The very top. We should go straight there."

It only takes Anakin a heartbeat to make the decision. "You do that," he says. "The rest of you, follow Kitster. I know you've all been waiting for this moment. I'll come to you when I can."

They don't need to ask why.

"Be careful." Amee gives him a half-hug, as close as they can manage from the crawling posture in the tight pipe. There's unshreded tears and unsaid farewell in her tones, but she manages to keep them down. Anakin pats her back.

"I'll see you in a minute," he promises.

The team nods simply, and Kitster leads the way upward.

Anakin shifts his attention to the endless, long corridors of each level and examines the patrols carefully. He extends his feelings out, feeling the fluster in the Force in this cold, metallic building, looking for anything warm and familiar.

It's a slow process, but the Force answers to him.

Obi-Wan is here, somewhere, he knows it, he can feel it. He just needs to get closer, he just needs to know where.

*Where are you, old man? Give me a signal. Do something, make this easier for me.* Anakin grits his teeth, forcing his mind's eyes to see farther, to sense more. He can sense the taste of ammunitions and weaponries permeating the majority of the place; in some level, chemicals are stronger than others. He pauses at the level where he thinks he hears heartbeats of living things. But they're faster than any humans or any races.

Anakin debates for a second if he should go to check it out, and save them, whatever they are, when a wave of Force moves grandly, as if a mountain crashes into the sea. Emotions pass through the Force a beat slower, and he senses a shock of pain. The thin thread of calling and pulling, just tightens a degree harder.

He's getting closer.

Anakin picks up his pace until he stops where he's sure the Force directs him to. He doesn't pay enough attention to the exact number of the level he moves, but it must be high. He wonders how close it is to the throne room, and how much time has passed. But he pushes the thought aside for now.

There are less droids in this level, but the troopers are more heavily armed. The rooms along the corridors are barred with heavy metals, controlled by electrical pads by the door.

Anakin's eyes linger on one of them, where the feeling is the strongest, where the Force is the strongest. His heart starts speeding up. Obi-Wan must be there.

The door slides open after he spends another minute hacking the electrical keypad violently. At this point, he doesn't care about being found out anymore. The chamber inside is dark and tiny, with a cylinder shape in the middle, lit by beam rays, trapping a man. The figure has his back facing the door, the lights around his ankles and wrists are stronger than anywhere else, presumably the main sources that trapped him there. His head drops low, outside of the view from where Anakin stands, and his whole body looks slumpy and tired. There seem to be hint of blood on his back, too, but it might also be the trick of the light.

"Obi-Wan!" Anakin blurts out, dashing to the other side of the room, jaws tight. Relief of seeing him and misery of finding him like this crash onto him at the same time.

But he stuns the moment he winds to the front.

The hologram of Obi-Wan flickers twice like a TV with bad signal, before it blinking into nothing. The confinement structure stands still with no one in the middle, and Anakin finds himself run right into a man in a dark cloak.

The man everyone in the Galaxy knows the name and hates, the man that always stand right by the Emperor's side, giving his council and doing his bidding -- The infamous Count Dooku.

"Look who we got here," Dooku takes a step toward him. A lightsaber buzzes into life, adding crimson light to the dim space.

"Count Dooku," Anakin grips the blast gun in his hand. Obi-Wan promised he would find him a lightsaber once he's ready, but they never get chance. So now, the blast gun is his only weapon, apart from a handy blade. He could have picked a few more, but when they were preparing and packing, he left the rest of the guns to everyone else -- they might need it more than he does.

Aiming the gun at Dooku's heart, Anakin's hand shakes. He's never killed anyone before. Even as they discussed the plan, it always sounded like just a concept -- the real execution of assassination, the part that involves death and blood, the part that taking a life by your hand. Anakin steadies his right hand by his left.

Dooku observes his every move closely, putting a feigned kindness on his face, "You must be the artist. Obi-Wan told me all about you, how you created the graffiti, what each pattern and color mean. That's quite clever, I have to say."

Anakin's heart sinks. *No,* he tells himself. *Obi-Wan is not the traitor.*

Kitster's voice echoes at the back of his head. *Have you ever considered maybe he's betrayed us? Tipped us off and he's just waiting for us to rush into the traps right about now?*

"No!" Anakin bites out loudly, aiming the gun a little higher. Dooku doesn't even twist his eyebrows, barely glancing at his gun as if it's nothing more than a toy.

"Are you sure?" Dooku taunts. "How long have you known him? A week? Two weeks? He has been with us, training and living in this place since three."

Anakin grits his teeth so hard that he can hear his own jaw bones shifting and muscles tightening right next to his ears. "It doesn't matter. It's not about him. It's about you."

"Is that so?" Dooku tilts his head, as if regarding an interesting exotic collection. "Then why are you here? You sensed his existence, did you not?"

"What have you done to him?" Anakin blurts out before he can stop himself.

"I killed him, of course." Dooku says carelessly, as if he just squashed an insect. He nods at a lightsaber hilt on the side table next to the containment field.

Rage overwhelms Anakin so quickly that his vision turns bloody for a split second. He opens shot.

Dooku tilts his body slightly, letting the bullet fly past him. Using that blink of distraction, Anakin lunges to the table to grab Obi-Wan's lightsaber, and clicks it to life.

The blue fills the room along with the buzzing. Anakin holds it in the way Obi-Wan taught him.

Dooku checks out his stance and gives him an approving nod. "Obi-Wan taught you well," he grins, swaying his saber for attack. "Let's see how's your fighting skills."

Anakin meets the fight head-on. The two-hour training wasn't enough to prepare him with any real skills. He fights intuitively.

He manages to block most of the attacks, or even strikes a few times. But that's about all the intuition can help him -- barely keep him not be killed.

Dooku takes a step closer, and Anakin has to take a step back to keep himself out of harm's way. Yet still, his cloth and skin are cut more times than he can count. Blood drips across his cheeks, shoulders, arms, and back. His moves are getting slower and slower.

"Force is strong with you, kid." Dooku doesn't give him a moment of breath, closing in quickly. Anakin jumps aside when he's forced to the wall, the next blow stabs right through the wall where his heart was. He has to duck and jump and dodge, it's probably more like a cat-like playing-with-food game than a real fight, Anakin knows he doesn't stand a chance to win. Like Obi-Wan said, like everyone said, he's not ready. And he hates that they seem to be right.

"Come join us," Dooku offers with a smile, as if it's a kindness. "We can use someone like you. We can train you properly."

"I'd rather die," Anakin spits, waving the saber in an outreaching position, predicting where the next strike will be.

"So be it," Dooku answers darkly, shifting the trajectory of his lightsaber suddenly, chopping down in the middle where Anakin's right arm extends.

A shrieking scream breaks out in the room as the blue lightsaber drops to the floor. The pitch is so high with pain that any glass might explode in vibration. Anakin holds his right arm in his chest, yelling in pain and agony. The pain is so sharp at the end of the wrist that his whole body shivers with shock. Blood gushes out of the missing end of the limb, losing so fast that he feels cold within seconds. Darkness with flashing stars threatens to take over the vision.

That's when the door bursts open from outside.

Anakin hears his name is called by the newcomer, but his brain seems to be slowing down in processing new information as well.

"Focus, Anakin, stay with me," the voice calls his name right in front of his face. A cold hand touches his cheek. "Anakin!"

"Obi-Wan?" Anakin answers tiredly, dully thinking if it's a vision his dying brain is trying to supply one last time. At least it's a nice face to look at.

Anakin tries to open his heavy eyelids, then his brain catches up. "Traitor." He tries to lean away.

The hand shaking him stills for a second, but it doesn't moves away. A warm current moves from the palm that lands on his forearm and flows toward the pain that's screaming at the end of that limb where his right hand should be.

"Use the Force, Anakin. Focus, and use the Force." Obi-Wan murmurs.

The pain quiets down as the current wraps him like a cradle.

Anakin opens his eyes.

The man is kneeling before him, one hand holding his back, the other on his forearm. The blood has been stopped.

"You shouldn't come back, Obi-Wan. That's the most stupid thing I've ever seen," Dooku says behind them, grinning humorlessly. "Now you both will die."

"I just suddenly remember I missed something and have to pick it up," Obi-Wan says lightly, gently laying Anakin down and standing up. He holds out a hand toward his lightsaber, and it flies into his palm.

Dooku's attack already resumes. The strikes are restless. Obi-Wan blocks most of them seamlessly, but for the rest, he dodges by walking back step by step. Dooku advances in his attack.

"More important than your own life?" His taunting doesn't stop either.

Obi-Wan smiles at that. "What can I say? A close friend reminded me lately, there is something worth dying for. And that's not empire."

He dances on the rim of the force containment field, swinging under the attack.

Dooku steps up the rim to get a stronger attack strike.

"You picked the wrong side, Obi-Wan," Dooku says coldly.

"And you, dear Count, picked the wrong side to stand." Obi-Wan winks, throwing his lightsaber over Dooku's head.

Dooku barely has time to stop the missing hit and turn around, before Anakin appears to stand behind him, grabbing the flying lightsaber with his left hand, and stabs it through Dooku's right shoulder.

"A friend taught me this one," Anakin says grimly. "And believe me, I know how much this hurts."

Dooku falls backward, collapsing right into the containment beam. The force cuffs fly to his wrists and ankles, locking him in the floating position immediately. Obi-Wan hurries to the control panel to tune up the force field.

Dooku tries to struggle, but the energy bindings don't give way.

"Save it, Dooku, you know how good these are. You built them yourself, didn't you?" Obi-Wan picks up the red lightsaber and deactivates it. "It's over."

Dooku grumbles with low curses.

Anakin leans back over the control table, out of breath.

"We should go now," Obi-Wan reaches a hand to let Anakin borrow, but the boy doesn't take it. Obi-Wan turns to him, finding his sad eyes on him.

"You should go," Anakin says, more misery than fury, holding his right arm closer.

"What?" Obi-Wan doesn't understand.

"I'm useless now anyway. Can't paint anymore. But there's another thing I can do to this building, and you don't want to be in it." Anakin averts his eyes.

"If you're talking about that hand, we have ways to fix it. I already used the Force to stabilize it, I have some friend who can fix it." Obi-Wan says, then his tone turns stern. "Don't you dare talking about giving up now. I didn't come back to leave you behind."

"You came back for me?" Anakin asks blankly, almost unbelievably. "There I was, thinking I'm here to rescue you."

Obi-Wan almost chuckles. "Took me a while and some broken bones, but yes, I managed to get out. Just on my way to warn you there might be traitors among us, and then I saw your art work on the wall out there. Then I knew you must already be in here."

"The wall?" Anakin frowns for a second, then remembers. "Oh, that's Wald."

"It has your signature," Obi-Wan tells him with a faint smile. "Then I felt you -- that huge pain in the Force scared me so much, I was afraid I might be too late, but it also helped me locate you. Imagine my surprise to find you in my old chamber."

"Imagine *my* surprise to find you don't even need my rescue." Anakin retorts weakly.

"Don't be too disappointed, you can save me next time," Obi-Wan smiles.

They start moving outside. Obi-Wan leads the way, introducing secret passageways and back doors where no patrols pass. They lower their volume but not stop talking.

"I knew these paths my whole life, and never have I thought about one day they'll be used for sneaking myself out." Obi-Wan exclaims.

"Wait, what?" Anakin stops his steps. "We're not retreating."

"Yes, we are." Obi-Wan meets his eyes. "You're in no condition to fight. We'd consider it lucky to get out alive."

"No! We see it through. We win, or we lose. I don't think we'll get another chance to hit again." Anakin raises his voice, but remembering they're still trying to be stealth, turning it into a rushed whisper. "And the rest of them are still here. I'm not the kind of person sending my friends to death and going back home alone and alive."

Obi-Wan looks at him intensely for a long moment before finally nodding and turning to a different corridor.

"Speaking of, who comes with you? I'm worried someone you trusted might mean you harm."

"No, I trust all of them," Anakin insists. "No one would."

Obi-Wan sighs. "That's why they're called traitors. It wouldn't be a betrayal if you didn't trust them. Think, Anakin, anyone can be."

"Like you?" Anakin asks with a straight face.

Obi-Wan stills again, watches his face carefully. "I swear it's not me. But I guess everyone would say that."

"I know," Anakin answers easily. "But I have to admit, for a second when Dooku said he knew about the decoding message, I really considered it might be you."

"How do you know it's not?"

"The same way I know I can trust everyone else, I can feel it. And also, the answer is actually quite obvious, once you figured it out."

Obi-Wan frowns. "Enlighten me."

"That's why you need me." Anakin curves his lips smirkingly. "You see, Dooku only knows 'I'm the artist', but not my name; he knows the decoding message, but not the actual meeting content. All his information comes from visual, but not vocal. And those are the exact photos you have in your datapad, I bet they hacked and started monitoring it long before you know."

Obi-Wan stares at him in disbelief. "I should know." He takes out his datapad and ready to throw it away, but Anakin stops him.

"No, wait, maybe we can use that." Anakin takes over the datapad and starts typing single-handedly.

Obi-Wan glances at him. "What are you doing?"

"Reverse-hacking them," Anakin looks up with excitement in his eyes. "I just have an idea. We might not have to *fight* them to win. How long do we have until the daily broadcasting?"

<br>

#### draft notes

Obi-Wan thinks it's someone in Anakin's group tipped them off, actually it's his own datapad being hacked and monitored, thus the info leak is limited to the photos he took before: the decoding sheet, the wall paint, the first gathering meeting

Dooku will try to use this to turn them against each other, try to make Anakin believe Obi-Wan betrayed them

### Chap 9 (Success)

> The two back-to-back fight together, Anakin is forced to use left hand fighting, non-dominant hand but the move become unexpected, successfully kills Palpatine (trial? make use of the broadcasting time? reverse-hacked the monitored datapad, use it to broadcast)
>
> they liberate the city, announce empire falls by drawing a huge blue graffiti on wall saying "Free". people want them be new leaders, they suggest building new Republic but need more help, sending out invite to hidden Jedi/senators in all plantes, inviting more wise people to reestablish democracy (e.g. look for Yoda, etc.).
>
> There are more work need to be done to build the new order, but good thing that they have each other. It's a new beginning for the whole galaxy and for the two of them.

The throne room is as heavily guarded as one can imagine. Troopers and droids stand outside the closed doors, shooting back at the rebels.

Amee is down, just like most of the others, lying on the floor with blood gathering slowly into a pool under her body. Kitster is the only one left standing, but from the sound of his yell and the limping, he's also shot more than once.

The floor of the corridor is scattered with bodies and broken droids and troopers. Anakin hates it that he doesn't have time to stop to check if they're still breathing. They're so close now.

Anakin clicks alive Dooku's lightsaber and Obi-Wan activates his. They stand back to back, the blocking and attacking slowly falling into sync. Waving with left hand is more than a little unaccustomed, but Anakin finds out it's not as uncomfortable as he thought.

They clear out the guards before the door eventually.

The Emperor is waiting for them.

Behind his chair, outside the floor-to-ceiling window, the entirety of Coruscant is right there, under his foot. All the large and small screens of the city show the same image of his face, smiling and talking the same words.

Anakin forces his attention move away from that bizarre view, back to the man on the chair.

"I heard you're looking for me," Palpatine says slowly, even with a smile. "And now you found me. What can I do for you?"

Anakin takes a large step forward. "Give us the Republic back."

Palpatine grins with teeth showing. "What's so good about Republic? It's all corrupted and ugly. It even led the galaxy into a three-year war! I brought peace back, people love peace, you love peace, don't you?"

"This is not peace, it's dictatorship!" Obi-Wan supplies, stepping forward, standing next to Anakin. "You didn't do it for the people. You did everything for yourself, so you can have all the power and control the galaxy."

"What's the difference? People are mindless creatures, they *need* to have a lead, they need to hear orders and know what to do. I'm just giving them what they want. And see, it works. It's all peace and quiet in the galaxy, what's it to complain about?" Palpatine opens his arms to make a showing gesture.

"What about freedom? What about art, and creativity, and people's life in the Lower Level? What about street painting, and... and --" Anakin stutters.

Obi-Wan picks up. "-- and public performance, night bars, freedom to meetings and gatherings, food and medications, equal rights, education..."

Palpatine snaps to cut the off, "What about them? Who cares if a random person in a corner died of cold -- it doesn't mean I need to make the whole world warmer. The war is over, what's better than that?"

A thought flips across Anakin's mind. "The war -- who knows if *you* are the one started it in the first place!"

The smile on Palpatine's face spread wider. "Boy, I know. Because I *am* the one started it."

Obi-Wan exchanges a quick look with Anakin, turning back to the Emperor: "Why are you telling us it now? "

"Because you won't be there telling anyone else," Palpatine says joyfully, waving a hand to order someone come over -- except no one does. "No one will know what happened, and the Empire will last for another thousand years."

"No, it won't." Anakin smiles confidently, taking out the datapad from his pocket. A blinking red light shines on the top.

Palpatine narrows his eyes. "What did you do?"

"Letting everyone know." Anakin casts a glance at the window behind. Out there, all the screens are showing the real streaming image from the datapad. They don't need to hear the sound to know every word Palpatine just said has been broadcasted to the whole galaxy.

People start rushing out onto the street, many are on their way crowding toward the Imperial Palace.

Palpatine's eyes land on the lightsaber hilt he left on the chair arm.

Anakin follows his gaze. "You can use it all you want," he challenges with a raised chin. "And the people will see how you use violence to solve problem. You may kill us, but the empire is already dead."

Palpatine sits back into his throne seat. "What are you going to do to me? Kill me? Like you killed Count Dooku? So people can know they'll just change from following one murder to another?"

"Except we're not," Obi-Wan tells him, with great satisfaction and pride. "Count Dooku is still alive, so will you be. There will be trial, and court, and justice, and law. We will do things properly, and people can decide your fate together. That's called democracy. That's how the order should have been, should always be."

So this is how it ends.

The guards that Palpatine called to come never enter, instead, when the troopers come into the chamber, they have torn down the imperial shoulder epaulets. Next to the chamber Dooku was confined in, they activated another force field to lock Palpatine in, waiting until the new order is set up and a trial is ready to conduct.

Anakin clicks the datapad a few more times. And when they look out of the window, the city's screens are showing something new and bright -- the photo Obi-Wan took, of the large, wild, colorful wall painting of a pair of rainbow-colored wings.

Except, now the wings are not limited to a simple plain wall in the Underground World, now they are everywhere, on all the screens, high and low, large and small, in every corner of the city. Anakin was right, the real art doesn't need decoding to understand, doesn't need translation to feel. The wings spread and hover and fly, and as if every pair of wings displayed in the city, is a life and a hope and a dream that a whole new world is coming, and in this world, freedom is not untouchable, art and expression is not forbidden, among everything else people wanted.

"Can't believe we did it," Anakin says quietly, staring out of the window. Then he looks up, staring into the sky. It's still at dark, night hour right now.

Obi-Wan stands next to him, shoulder to shoulder, looking at the same view, same city, same world. "You did it," he turns to glance at the boy that is no longer just a young, innocent artist, but a grown man, a leader, a revolutionist. "What are you going to do now?"

Anakin shakes his head, but still keeps his eyes on the world, on the sky. "I don't know, and it's terrifying. I imagine people would want us to build the new world, but we'll definitely need more help, maybe starting with inviting all the wise people back."

"I know perfectly who to ask. Master Yoda, for one, should be here." Obi-Wan nods approvingly.

Anakin nods agreeingly. "But for now, I think I'll just stand here until the sun rises. For the first time, I want to see the real sky turning into the real blue, I want to know -- of all the time we paint the blue on the wall, to mean safe and free, how close we are."

Obi-Wan glances at him again, hesitating, then deciding. "I'll leave you to it, then."

He turns slowly, adding, "It's been really nice knowing you, Anakin."

The young voice stops him behind his back, "You can call me 'Ani' now, if you want."

"And one more thing, I'd like you stay here, when the sun rises and the sky turns blue."

"I'd like that, too."

So he stays.



###### END
