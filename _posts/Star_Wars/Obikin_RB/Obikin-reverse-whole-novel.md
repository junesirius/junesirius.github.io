### Setups

What if, when Anakin was three, he and Shmi were not sold to the Hutts and Watto in Tatooine during slave trade, instead, they were sold to an underground black market art smuggler in Coruscant. Ani started learning/having interest in art by watching/witnessing/helping out those art transactions, Shmi encouraged him to learn painting, it distracted him from slave life. The smuggler died in some art dealer auction conflict shortly and they were let go in chaos (no one cared about them, not realized they're gone). Shmi died shortly after due to some sickness, Anakin grew up alone (with other homeless orphan kids, e.g. Kitster Banai, Wald, Amee) in lower Coruscant, managed to survive on his own in the hard life, did a lot of small outlaw things to support himself, steal/rob/pick up dumpster to get food/money/everything, ran away from police a lot, get into trouble a lot, still try to make art (initially because it comforts him and make him think of mom, later find out more practical usage.)

ep1 timeline, without Ani, Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan didn't go into pod racing bet, didn't get hyperdrive to fix ship, stuck in Tatooine, got caught up by Maul. Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan 2v1 fought Maul, Qui-Gon/Maul died, Padme/Obi-Wan went back to Coruscant in Maul's ship, Palpatine became chancellor. Coruscant was in the corrupted, late Republic stage.

ep2 timeline, Palpatine started clone war, had Jedi and senate all in control. ep3 timeline (current, 19 BBY), Palpatine becomes emperor, all uncooperative Jedi were persecuted or went hiding (e.g. Yoda/Windu disappeared) (=canon Order 66), remaining Jedi mostly get brainwashed/forced to become Palpatine's personal police force. Without Anakin, Dooku is still alive so far, active in conducting Palpatine's orders.

Coruscant the whole city is in strict martial control, has curfew, random arrest for any violation, no free expression, no freedom, reign of terror. Obi-Wan is tasked to clean out lower Coruscant instability sources (Obi-Wan already hesitant about Palpatine and everything but not defiant yet, "not set in stone"). Anakin join/form/lead secret rebel force, starting with childhood friends, advocating rebellion with graffiti art. They run into each other, Obi-Wan notices Anakin's Jedi potential, impressed, starts swaying, chases around, starts to appreciate the art (graffiti actually are code words for assemblies, words/certain color combinations have special meanings, they have a set of secret word, red+some shape=danger, purple/yellow=drop everything and run, blue=safe, green+certain keyword=next meeting time/location and proceed as usual), gets tricked to underground rebellious meeting, given the option of join them and fight against emperor and very likely die, or comply with Jedi brainwash doctrine and fight against rebels, neither know if he'd get harmed by rebels or he'd win and bring Anakin in, which would likely cause Anakin executed by Dooku.

Obi-Wan's decision point, has to choose a side, start with only small help/subtle sign of slipping to their side, e.g. a few times when chasing around he actually already run into Anakin/could have arrested him but deliberately pretend as if missed. slow(/steep?) slip, every decision point actually all chooses Anakin, very clear starting to change side, take more and more interest in Anakin, learn more about him and his past and ideation, the two of them talk more, learn about each other more, start join rebellion meetings (start with only listen at outer rim, not speak), start secretly training Anakin properly, teach him use weapons and Force power. The two become popular among the group, come up with actual real attacking plans, Obi-Wan give them useful suggestion to actually do some real rebel fight against Empire's controlled troops/facilities and win, slowly turn to new leaders people willing to follow.

Obi-Wan meanwhile acts as their double agent in Jedi and near Palpatine. They planned to wait until Anakin is ready to make the final move on Palpatine, but Obi-Wan is already suspected by Palpatine, get confined/tortured/interrogated, very close to be prosecuted (charge of traitorous/treason), know there is info leak (graffiti encoding meaning is leaked, someone from inside might get turned, has rat), know rebels are in danger (Dooku is tasked to kill them all). they all are forced to start the revolution movement earlier than planned, jump-start full-on revolution, Obi-Wan/Anakin in lead. Anakin go into Imperial Palace with the group, has disagreement within team of whether the goal is mainly to rescue Obi-Wan or assassinate Palpatine, Anakin faces the option of either killing Palpatine or saving Obi-Wan, and chooses Obi-Wan, gets himself in danger (run into Dooku, fight, get his right hand cut, like canon).

It turns out Obi-Wan manage to escape on his own (wounded but nonfatal), ready to leave to warn them, come back to rescue Anakin, the two kill Dooku. Obi-Wan uses Force heal to stabilize Anakin's handicapped hand, Anakin furious, desperate, fear can't paint again. Obi-Wan suggests retreat for now, Anakin insists see it through, now or never. The two back-to-back fight together, Anakin is forced to use left hand fighting, non-dominant hand but the move become unexpected, successfully kills Palpatine, they liberate the city, announce empire falls by drawing a huge blue graffiti on wall saying "Free". people want them be new leaders, they suggest building new Republic but need more help, sending out invite to hidden Jedi/senators in all planets, inviting more wise people to reestablish democracy (e.g. look for Yoda, etc.). There are more work need to be done to build the new order, but good thing that they have each other. It's a new beginning for the whole galaxy and for the two of them.

### Claim info

**Optional prompts:** The city was becoming more depressing as the authority stamps out different voices and forms of expression under the rule of Palpatine. However, as Obi-Wan tries to catch up with the notorious graffiti artist the star chaser... he came to appreciate the rebellious side of life...

**Hard No's:** Bottom Obi-Wan, bathroom kinks, unhappy endings, too much violence, other pairings other than present Obikin, non-con

### Summary

What if, when Anakin was three, instead of being sold to the Hutts on Tatooine, he and his mother were sold to an unlawful art dealer in the underground world of Coruscant?

The galaxy is yet again becoming the Galactic Empire under Emperor Palpatine's control, and Jedi -- at least what's left of it, including Obi-Wan -- become the Empire's peace-keeping tools, pursuing the rebellion forces.

That is until Obi-Wan starts learning to appreciate the graffiti arts.

It is a story about hope, rebellion, freedom, creation, and so much more. And of course, how these things change people's lives and the galaxy's fate fundamentally.

### Editing Notes

Both Obi-Wan and Anakin's eyes are blue, so when choose color code: blue = safe

mention Force heal early on when training/showing what Force can do (foreshadowing for Force heal Anakin's cut hand)

mention most of childhood friends early on, include them in later rebel group, represent "people"

To speed up writing Obi-Wan's name, use "obiwan" in the initial writing (start with capital), global auto search-switch once all is finished

## Main

### Chap 1 (Encounter)

> (big environment setups, current timeline: 1y after Order 66 and "First Galactic Empire", 5y after Clone War started)
>
> Coruscant the whole city is in strict martial control, has curfew, random arrest for any violation, no free expression, no freedom, reign of terror. Obi-Wan is tasked to clean out lower Coruscant instability sources (Obi-Wan already hesitant about Palpatine and everything but not defiant yet, "not set in stone").

At seven, all the outdoor screens and holograms are synchronized to the empire broadcast channel, so are the indoor displays in every habitant's house.

It is the same in Coruscant as it is in every planet in the galaxy.

Near the window of his chamber, facing outside, Obi-Wan stands stiffly straight. The view has never stopped looking uneasy, no matter how many times he witnesses. It has been a year, since the announcement of the First Galactic Empire.

The images in the screens and holograms shift at the same time, from an electrical black to the face of Empire Palpatine, smiling kindly at the screen -- as if he's just that same old kind senator from Naboo, recently selected as the chancellor, with the only difference being the title and addressing now becoming "Emperor." Images of his face, large and small, high and low, are displayed on every inch of the screens around the city, his eyes staring at every citizen of the galaxy from all different angles.

Obi-Wan can't help a shiver, and doesn't allow himself to think of why.

He is a Jedi that serves this galaxy, be it republic or empire, his duty remains the same -- for the benefit of the people. And if the empire ensures the peace and prosperity, stops the war, serves people food, then so be it. He would follow the orders and do his job, even if the order now comes from Emperor Palpatine, instead of Jedi Master Counsel, or Senate and Court.

He still turns away from the window when the speech begins. Light shifts outside his window, casting colorful shadows on the opposite wall. He stands in the dark, listening, with his eyes trained on the wall.

The announcement is almost expectable every day -- start with a warm and kind greeting from Emperor Palpatine, talking about how valuable peace and quietness in the city and the galaxy is, after the three-year-long Clone Wars, and the necessity of the Order 66 of removing the traitors to ensure the remaining Jedi are all loyal and serving. The galaxy is not yet in a stable state; there are still rebellions and separatists that are wishing to see the empire breaking apart, see people's lives suffer in wars. And Coruscant as the capitol is undoubtably their first target. That is why the strict martial order is still necessary in the city, the curfew is at eight, any violation to the order will be arrested, any expression that endangers the safety of the empire will be arrested. If, upon investigation, such violation are vindicated guilty, the involved personnel will be executed. Everything is for the safety of the empire and all the lawful citizens living under the empire's protection. Ending with "Enjoy a good night. Long live the Galactic Empire."

The streets are quiet outside. Empty, ghostly quiet. The curfew officially starts at eight, but after a year, people already know well enough to stay inside after the sun down -- Jedi patrol would already start when the speech begins, ensuring no one interfering or jeopardizing the public safety, from Upper Level to Lower Level of the city.

People have also learned well enough to not protest against Jedi patrols or security guards -- not publicly on street anyway. Obi-Wan rubs his temples, missing the old days. People seem to forget they used to be peace keepers, during the republic time. They were respected, looked up to. And now --

He remembers the disgusted looks from people when he walked past them to examine an suspicious-looking bar in the Lower Level, not long ago. The bar turned out legit, with all the complete certifications and registrations. So he walked out with empty hands, ready to report back to the Imperial Palace -- which used to be the Jedi Temple, another thing that he tried not to think too hard every time he steps in or out.

One of the patrons spat at his back: "That's right, run back to your master, you spineless hatchet man, murderer of the freedom."

There were some loud gasping. Then the whole bar fell dead silent. Quiet enough to hear his own heartbeat, and that of every single being.

He turned back slowly, forcing his hand in place, staying by his side, instead of reaching automatically for his lightsaber like all these years of training and his muscle memory demanded.

The voice was young. Merely a boy that did not know any better. There was no need to get into trouble with them. He wasn't even there for them.

Obi-Wan scanned the bar as he turned around. Patrons under his eyes all looked away uneasily, many still having that lingering expression of distaste on their faces, a few glancing at the speaker worriedly. The boy looked barely twenty, tall and slim, in humble clothes that were too short at the end of ankles and wrists, with dirty smudges of paintings layered on top -- typical look of a Lower Level kid, if he was even legit to live in the city.

Obi-Wan regarded him, scrutinizing him with a look that most adults would choose to look away or fidget uneasily. The boy did not. His eyes were sharp, too sharp and accusing for his age -- or maybe kids were just tend to grow faster nowadays, he wouldn't know. He wasn't the first boy Obi-Wan ran into that had that look of defiance in his eyes, and definitely wouldn't be the last, as long as the Empire exists, as long as the creature called "boy" exists.

And they were blue. Obi-Wan remembers himself thinking. Those young eyes, looking into his like the eyes of an eagle born on the cliff and grow on the sea, a look of a wild creature, a trouble-maker.

He swallowed, shifting slightly, keeping his gaze on the boy's forehead instead. "What's your name?" he asked, taking a step forward.

The crowd in the bar stepped back automatically, emptying out a five-feet opening around them.

The boy did not move. He tightened his jaw, lifting his chins. "Who wants to know?"

There was another quiet gasp in the crowd, some worried whisper.

Obi-Wan glanced outside. The daylight was running out fast -- the sky was too far away from the Lower Level to see, it was always dark around here, it was the artificial light simulating the daylight that were turning darker. And the temperature in the air was dropping. Soon, it would be the curfew. He would have to take them into custody according to the new curfew regulation if this farce lasted any longer.

He wouldn't want to get into the trouble of taking all those people to the Custody Center and filing all the paperwork, as much as these people having any interest of going. But right now, with his presence, they weren't even dare to move, let alone leaving the place.

Might as well call it a day and end the whole damn thing quickly. Even if it means let the boy think he won the round, with that satisfied smirk on the tip of his lips.

Obi-Wan sighed. "Jedi Master Kenobi, on official empire duty," he said in a business tone, examining around the crowd again.

Probably the friendliest olive branch they'd ever seen and will ever see from an imperial law enforcer.

"Well, Kenobi," the boy said, aggressively, not caring about using the correct addressing, in a tone far too cold and remote, "Are you going to arrest me, for telling the truth? Are you not working for the empire to destroy the democracy and freedom, and ruin our lives?"

"You should arrest all of us then," another voice in the crowd yelled. He didn't pay attention who, presumably some friends of this kid, exactly as reckless and mindless as he was.

Obi-Wan took another step forward, standing right in front of the boy -- who was about the same height as him, Obi-Wan realized. With this close distance, those dazzling blue eyes were as clean as the distant stars, reflecting his own image.

Obi-Wan looked into his eyes, lowering his voice. "You should be more careful, boy, and show me some respect," he warned him, biting on the word "boy" a little too hard than necessary. "Don't give me a reason to. Next time, I might have to. And you know damn well I will."

He didn't wait for an answer. Casting a quick glance at the surrounding crowd, he told them "As you were," and left the bar.

For days, that pair of blue eyes and the accusations haunted him. Obi-Wan went to the meditation room more frequently than usual, but his mind still refused to quiet.

He stares at the wall in his chamber, and wonders if the boy is also listening to the same message from the Emperor's broadcast somewhere down there in the Lower Level of the city; if he was stupid enough to get himself into trouble with other Jedi patrols or imperial troopers -- he wouldn't be surprised if he did.

There is something else around the boy that bothers him. He can't even tell if it is a disturbance in the Force around him, or just the disturbed mind of himself. The boy is already a trouble just by standing there in the room. For a brief moment, he wished his old Master or other Grand Masters were still here, telling him the answer, guiding him the right way.

Obi-Wan sighs, burying the thoughts. He shouldn't be wondering about those nonsenses, he's just doing his job nowadays. Get assigned new tasks everyday, complete them, go back chamber to rest for a few hours, continue the next day. Sometimes he doesn't know if he has any difference with those security droids anymore. Somewhere in the mind and heart, things are just dulled, feelings numbed.

He straightens his tunic, checks the lightsaber and blaster gun in place, and walks out of the room.

Tonight is his turn of patrol. And he is assigned the Lower Level.

### Chap 2 (Chase)

> Obi-Wan notices graffities for the first time, reports to Emperor, gets tasked to find who the artist is and arrest them, otherwise Dooku will personally come for them 
>
> Obi-Wan runs into Anakin a second time, but doesn't arrest him (excuse: not enough proof)

The Lower Level isn't just one single level, or anything close to just a button on an elevator panel that is placed at the bottom of all the levels.

It's all the places below the ground. All the levels that cannot see the sky. The underground world.

Obi-Wan gets off the speeder, tugging his tunic closer, wrapping himself with his arms under the coat, as if that way he could blend in with local people here -- as if there is any *people* to be blended in.

He examines the empty streets, one level at a time, starting from Level Zero to lower.

No one is on the street.

The world is quiet and dead down here, as is above the ground. The curfew and martial orders have been complied strictly, much to the Emperor's satisfaction.

There are droids and troopers stationed on each level for regular maintenance and surveillance, to handle everyday peace-keeping martial tasks. So as far as Obi-Wan can see, assigning Jedi down here is more or less a waste of effort, unless there is any outburst severe enough that combat skills were to be needed. But if that happened, it might as well be the trigger for another clone war again -- which isn't anything a single Jedi can possible handle -- just between the people and the Empire. Obi-Wan doesn't know if he's ready for anything like that again so soon. The peace under the Empire's choking control is at least, still peace, still a time for some breath.

His mind wanders around as he walks down the street, his eyes scanning around the open spaces on each level, his feeling dissolving into the Force around them.

From Level Zero to Level Four, the lower he reaches, the shabbier and narrower the streets become. The houses are smaller, lower, more broken. Doors and windows are covered with paper and cloth patches, even a wooden plank patch would be a luxury. Barely any street light.

No living creature in sight. It's as if he's just walking around on a detonated, nuclear wasted planet.

Obi-Wan speeds up his steps, not wanting to stay too long in any of these levels.

He goes to the Level Five next.

There is something different about Level Five, he senses it as soon as he steps out of the speeder. The vision, the smell, the rigorousness, a living life form in a dead city. It takes his conscious mind one more second to realize what's the difference.

The street walls are neither barren nor grey. Not the dirty color with occasional red and black smudges that look like nothing other than dried blood. Unlike other Levels.

In here, the walls are unbelievably colorful, with bright colors scattering all over the color spectrum, as if painting palettes for rainbows are poured onto the walls. There are words and sentences too, together with graffities of cartoonized figures, exaggerated creations, images of random creatures, symbols that aren't any known language to his knowledge. The end of brushes are almost always rushed, with visible unclean stroke, as if whoever did this has to finish the thing in a tight time frame.

Obi-Wan walks down the street, staring at those graffities with wide eyes. People are getting bold and reckless down here. That sense of disturbance in the Force is getting stronger the longer he looks at them. He fidgets uneasily as he examines them.

The paints those graffities were using seem normal enough, the cheap kind that one can find anywhere, probably even locally in each level. The content, however, maybe has something worth noticing -- though he can't really understand what they're about for the most parts. They are like doodling, coming out of wild imagination of a five-year-old. It's refreshing in an almost disturbing way.

He doesn't know how to make of it -- so he reports it in, like the new Jedi code the Emperor required.

<br>

The Emperor assembles an emergency meeting the very next day, calling Obi-Wan to report what he saw. Officers and representatives from different areas of expertise are requested. Count Dooku, the Emperor's personal guard stands right behind his throne.

Obi-Wan tries his best to explain those abstract bright lines and curves and patterns, realizing words are too pale to describe, one has to see to know what he's talking about. He finishes awkwardly with that exact suggestion.

Emperor Palpatine asks him to go back to his seat.

A group of representatives of the meeting says it's nothing to worry about, maybe just a kid messing around. Another group says it's a clear and aggressive sign of rebellion against the Empire, anyone involved in it should be arrested and executed immediately. And another asks nonchalantly why that is even a problem.

The Emperor coughs loudly, and starts speaking slowly: "This is a gesture of dissatisfaction from a small group of people, lashing out their childish emotions on public properties. This should not be allowed. Those paintings might increase the doubt in people's mind, affecting the brief peace we have fought so hard to earn and finally have now. I will add the new regulation in tonight's announcements to prohibit such behavior."

Therefore by night, when the new and old regulations are being broadcast, Obi-Wan isn't exactly surprised to find out a newly added regulation, but hearing the exact words still makes his heart twist in discomfort. The new regulation says: "Any and all, public or private, display of all formats, regarding personal expression unaligned with the Empire Value is illegal, including but not limited to street art, street painting, street performance. Therefore, certain behaviors like graffiti are strictly forbidden, and anyone who conducted this illegal behavior will be held legal responsibility, arrested and personally investigated by The Emperor and the highest security team."

By "highest security team," he undoubtedly means Count Dooku himself.

Obi-Wan chokes on the water he's drinking, feeling a sick wrench at the lower of his stomach, as if he's both punched there hard and going to vomit at the same time.

He rushes toward the door of his chamber.

And runs right into Count Dooku.

Obi-Wan halts harshly, holding on the door to steady himself, more startled than surprised. "Count Dooku," he greets, trying his best to keep his voice and breath stable.

Count Dooku eyes him, "Jedi master Kenobi, so good to see you. The Emperor has an assignment for you. We have reason to believe those graffities are signs where a new rebellion force is forming, endangering the peace and stability of the Empire. You are tasked to find those dangerous rebellion sources, and take them to the Emperor. If you fail, *I* will go to the Lower Level myself. Do you understand?"

"Yes, perfectly clear. I will be on my way to the Lower Level immediately," Obi-Wan hears his voice answer automatically.

Count Dooku nods once with approval, still watching him. His gaze lays a heavy, palpable weight on Obi-Wan's back like a snake winding around a prey, as he dashes down the corridor toward his speeder.

Descending into the darkness of the Lower Level has never before feels so comforting. Just knowing the distance from the choking air up there increases as he flies down makes his clenched heart uncoiling -- even just the slightest. He still doesn't know what exactly he'd be running into down there, and what he'd do if he finds those people.

Obi-Wan breathes more easily and steadily with the artificial wind when he arrives at Level Five.

<br>

The night doesn't give him enough information -- at least that's the reason he gives himself -- so Obi-Wan thinks he might as well wait until the day time to continue his investigation.

He drifts across the streets like a living ghost.

The street comes to life when the morning comes.

The view shifts so much from the curfewed dark night that he can barely recognize it is still the same place. The colorful markings and doodles on the walls are almost like real, living lives, waking up in the brighter day night, yawning and gazing at the pedestrians. And look at those pedestrians! Most of them dress in exotic cloth from so many different alien culture, it's hard to tell apart which colors are stationary on the walls, which ones moving with the local people. Obi-Wan feels as if he's fording in the pond of color when he walks through the streets.

He steps closer to the walls, standing before the one near one end of the street, watching it closely.

He doesn't know much about art, or painting, or whatever style this may be called in academia -- abstractionism or something along the line -- he just hopes the observation can give him some answer of where to locate the mysterious now-number-one-wanted graffiti artist.

The longer he stares, the more senses those characters and patterns seem to be presenting themselves. He thinks he can spot a few repetitive pattern with certain combination of colors and characters. But it could also be coincidences that his mind is just making up theories he wishes to see.

Encryption and decryption isn't his best school work, nor is art. Obi-Wan sighs, taking out his personal handheld datapad, starts taking record of these arts to take back for analysis in the Jedi library computer later.

He doesn't realize the way his feet was taking him along the painted wall that leads toward the end of the alley, where the bar that almost caused him that fight with the locals located, until he's already at its door.

The last graffiti ends outside the bar.

Obi-Wan halts his steps sharply in front of the bar, ready to take a turn. It is at this exact moment, a figure emerges from the exit door, almost bumping right into him.

"Excuse me," a familiar, young voice says.

Obi-Wan looks up, running into a pair of recognizable eyes. "It's you."

That reckless, defiant, young boy with blue eyes glares back at him. His eyes narrow with recognition, "You again, Jedi."

"Jedi Master Kenobi," Obi-Wan can't help correcting him.

"I remember," the boy smirks, looking right back at him, the same way he did last time. His cloth is even dirtier than last time -- no, not "dirty," more colorful. More paints with the same set of bright colors on those walls has left marks and smudges on his thin shirt and cheap hooded jacket with the same color as his eyes. In his hands, he's holding a handful of spray cans.

Obi-Wan's heart sinks when his eyes land on those. Yet somehow, he thinks he already knows it even before running into the boy again.

The boy follows his gaze and sees where his attention gets attracted to. He shifts his arms so the cans are half hidden behind his body.

"I see you're interested in arts," Obi-Wan comments cautiously, glancing at the painted walls beside them. "Did you not hear the latest regulation announced last night? The street arts and graffities are strictly forbidden now."

The boy quirks a smirking smile, "I wonder who did those arts, I'll make sure to let them know not to do that again." The silent challenge is more than loud enough for Obi-Wan to hear in his undertones: *You don't have proof it's me. That's why you're just standing here staring at me, waiting for me to give up evidence, aren't you? Think again, I'm not stupid. So what are you going to do, Kenobi?*

And that is exactly why Obi-Wan can't take him in now -- he'll need more proof than the cans to call the boy suspicious or guilty. He'll have to catch him in action or something of the kind.

Obi-Wan can do nothing but glare at him.

Another voice calls across the street: "Ani, you coming or not?"

The boy's head jerks to the source of the voice. "In a minute," he yells back.

Obi-Wan raises his eyebrows in a joyful beam. "So it's Ani."

"It's 'Anakin' to you," the boy snaps. "'Ani' is only for my friends."

"Alright, Anakin," Obi-Wan says compliantly, voice softer, glancing at the spray cans in his hands again. "Just so you know, whoever is painting those, I'll have to arrest them if I find them."

Anakin shrugs carelessly. "Then I'll make sure they are never found." He turns to catch up with his friends.

Obi-Wan watches his back with a lump in his throat.

He goes back to study the paintings for the rest of the day, and he doesn't run into Anakin for another three days.

Obi-Wan: "not set in stone"

Obi-Wan is tasked to clean out lower Coruscant instability sources

### Chap 3 (Trick)

> Obi-Wan runs into Anakin again. Anakin join/form/lead secret rebel force, starting with childhood friends, advocating rebellion with graffiti art. Obi-Wan notices Anakin's Jedi potential, impressed, starts swaying, chases around, starts to appreciate the art (graffiti actually are code words for assemblies, words/certain color combinations have special meanings, they have a set of secret word, red+skeleton=danger; purple/yellow+snake pattern=drop everything and run, the more poisonous the snake, the bigger the danger; blue+dove=safe, green+certain keyword/beard=next meeting time/location and proceed as usual), gets tricked to underground rebellious meeting (Obi-Wan thinks he starts able to decode the message, but actually they purposefully leave the hint)

Obi-Wan ends up not sending the images of the graffities to the Jedi library for analysis. He chooses to sit down before the painted walls, and starts studying them on his own. He can't explain why he's doing all that.

He doesn't even go back to the Upper Level for his daily check-in reports. Merely sending in messages to say he's in the undercover task, he'll be in touch when convenient.

The Emperor seems pleased that he's been spending all his time down here, but he suspects Count Dooku might not be so patient, from the replies he received. He doesn't have much time -- either to figure out what's happening in the Lower Level and fix the situation by himself, or probably have to watch someone else to come down here fixing it for him, which includes fixing *him*.

Obi-Wan takes a long breath, pulling his thought back to the graffiti arts. He thinks he's getting closer.

The art is very expressional and artistic, to say the least. But now he's also fairly certain they're also equally informational. The Emperor's suspicion on it being a sign of rebellion's existence might not be entirely unreasonable.

There are certain color and word combinations that've been repeatedly spotted from different part of the streets, followed closely by a different set of color and unrecognizable characters, usually in green and blue. And if the leading combination is in red and has a skeleton or skull somewhere around, no matter how small they are, then no more mysterious characters.

Obi-Wan thinks he's starting to get the whole language system in the art, if only he can find a decoder ring to fill in the remaining gap.

And the opportunity presents itself quicker than he knows. Like a blessing that his prayer is answered.

<br>

On the third day after he knows Anakin's name, he runs into the boy again. And this time, he catches him right on the crime scene.

Obi-Wan is examining a back alley where a new set of painting has been freshly added. Judging by the undried paint, he'd guess whoever did this -- even if he knows it must be Anakin, he's still leaving the space for reasonable doubt -- they can't be far. Those new graffities are at most two hours old, the tail of the stroke is rushed in smudged blue.

He follows the only way where that alley leads, and sees Anakin busy working on a new pattern just a block away. He holds a spray can and the paint lands on the wall with a curve.

Obi-Wan dashes toward him quietly, but Anakin already senses his approach like a cat hearing human's footsteps.

The boy seems surprised to see him there, but as soon as his eyes land on Obi-Wan, there is a small mischievous twitch on his lips. From the distance, Obi-Wan can't tell if it's a smirk or panicked gasp. The kid doesn't bother collecting the cans at the foot of the wall, just turning to the tail of the alley and running.

Obi-Wan picks up his pace to follow him closely.

But the Lower Level, if nothing else, is *the* most perfect place for hide-and-seek. And Anakin has clearly spent enough time here to know all the small turns and hideouts and hidden doors, and he's certainly not hesitant to utilize those knowledge. He slips through them nimbly like rabbit in the field.

Within five minutes, Obi-Wan finds himself in the middle of a residential area, surrounded by houses with closed windows and doors. Anakin could have been hidden in any one of them, or he might already escape to the other end of this Level, maybe even to a different Level, if he wants. Obi-Wan would have to knock on every door to be sure, and if that comes out with empty hands, he might as well dig the whole Level's ground to be able to find him again.

Obi-Wan goes back the way he comes.

Even those scattered cans at the foot of the wall have been taken. Anakin must have come back when he manages to get rid of Obi-Wan's trail. The boy is good, Obi-Wan has to give him that.

He studies the new graffiti instead. The pattern that he remembers seeing blue is now covered by a red skeleton. A strong stroke of purple mixed with some dark yellow crosses out something that was probably green down there, the letters of the unknown language is now completely indistinct.

Looks exactly like a warning notice and something like an evacuation order that cancelled a previously scheduled assembly because something dangerous has happened. *OH --* Obi-Wan realizes suddenly. Something dangerous like a Jedi has been in sight. *Him.*

They have a communication system to warn about his route, that must be why it's been so difficult to even spot a foot track of Anakin. Or anyone else he might be working with. And if they have been going through all these trouble just to hide something from him, then there must be something utterly serious that needs ultimate secrecy. Something bigger than just some graffiti art.

The Emperor's suspicion of a rebel force might just be on the right track.

If only he could be sure.

Obi-Wan glances down at the ground, looking for more leads.

And there, on the ground, among dirty paper tissues stained with sprays, cigarette butts, and other trashes, are scattered, torn scraps of a paper. Looks exactly like any other trash, and easily mistaken as just a normal piece of random trash, but the same kind of disturbance when he senses around Anakin also surrounds them, as if they're calling for him.

Obi-Wan spends about an hour picking up every small piece of the scraps he can find and puts them back together. The tears are random and careless, making it probably the worse puzzle game in the world, but not impossible to recover. Not for him, at least.

And lucky for him, the words on the paper are not ruined by the tears. What he finds on there, however, makes his eyes widened.

In scratchy and barely legible writing, it's the exact translation guidance he wishes to find, about the meanings of the symbols on the wall.

Not all of them, it seems, when he cross-compares the symbols in front of him with the patterns on the paper. And there are still gaps in the paper where the scrapes must have been blown away by the wind. But enough to make sense and understand the crucial message.

The red skeleton and skull is a warning sign, just as he concluded. The combination of purple and that certain dark yellow snaky pattern means "drop everything and run." That greenish blue means safe, and there is a specific symbol for each of about a dozen locations and each hour of the day. With a certain combination, one can know exactly when and where -- for a next meeting, undoubtedly.

"You really think tearing it up would be enough to hide from a Jedi, Anakin? You shouldn't underestimate me," Obi-Wan murmurs to the paper, feeling it's a little too easy. He wonders if it's because this time he was already too close to catching him, and the boy had to run in a fluster escape.

He takes out his personal datapad to take a photo of the pieced-together paper, and ignites the original with his lightsaber. Obi-Wan only thinks back why he did it until after all the paper pieces became burned, black ashes. And he doesn't have a good answer. *Just for safety.* He tells himself. But even he knows it sounds a little lame.

He decidedly steers his mind away and starts looking for their next assembly plan.

He does not report this latest breakthrough finding, either. He tells himself he'd report once he's found something more solid. He doesn't have enough proof yet.

The only proof that turned into the ash flies in the air when a breeze comes by. They're scattered farther, and then gone without a trace.

<br>

Their next assembly will be in the basement of a deserted factory, three hours before the curfew on a Friday afternoon.

Obi-Wan finds the latest piece of graffiti with the announcement another two days later, and thanks to the decoder sheet, he reads it like looking into words written in plain common language. And with bright colors and powerful strokes, the art is practically shouting "Freedom" and "Rebel" at his face, along with some really strong words regarding the Empire. If the Upper Level ever finds out the true meaning of these arts, anyone involved would get electrocuted. No question asked.

Obi-Wan frowned at them when he saw them, eyebrows deeply furrowed. He can't feel more glad that at least among everyone from security and guarding forces, *he* is the one tasked for this and finding out what they're plotting. He can't imagine what kind of massacre it would turn into, if Count Dooku ever comes down here and finds what he found. It gives him a shiver when he imagines the colorful walls are splattered with dark bloody red.

The back door of that deserted factory is loosely opened with a slit when he arrives, an hour before the assembly starts. He sneaks in easily without a sound. The rusty door looks as if it's going to moan when he passes it, but he wills it to be quiet, and god-blessingly it complies.

The place is dim and shabby, much like all the constructions in this Level nowadays. But in the middle of the ground, there is a big enough opening for people to gather. Perhaps to have some treacherous discussions, if he has to guess, maybe even some bold movement against the Empire -- for which he can snuff out the bud of an rebellion against the Empire now that he's here. Obi-Wan figures, hiding behind a corner behind a broken column, waiting patiently for the assembly to start.

An hour passes.

And then the second hour.

The space is getting darker as it comes closer to the night time. The only light comes in through a dirty window high on the wall, near the edge of the ceiling.

Only when Obi-Wan starts doubting if he's really translating those patterns correctly, or the sheet is lying, people start walking in.

But instead of hearing a radical, reactionary, bolshy assembly as he expected, those people start talking about the tough lives civilians were living nowadays under the Empire's military control, the suffocating atmosphere that stifles any creative expressions, the assistance each one of them can provide for one another, and most of all, how they can make people's life better.

They are kind, and friendly, and calm. Only when they talk about their neighbors' starved kids or sick elderlies do they sound emotional, sobbing quietly in unshed tears.

Obi-Wan swallows hard as he listens.

*These are just people.* He thinks, astonished and uncharacteristically upset, behind the column, in the shadow he hides, just like the shadow those people are used to live in. These are just ordinary people trying so hard to have a life, and the Empire is squeezing their living space, suffocating them mentally and physically.

He doesn't realize since when has he started clenching his fist or biting on his teeth, or what's that for. He forces his fists and jaws to relax, and continues listening. He's still a Jedi for this galaxy, after all. Surely maintaining a peaceful galaxy is more important than one poor kid or one old man. His job tonight is still to follow the order and arrest the dangerous rebel forces, led by none other then the familiar one who has a young voice and a familiar slim figure.

Obi-Wan stares at the boy -- a young man actually, he looks more like a leader now, standing before the group, soothing them with soft voice, giving them instructions of how to fix some of the difficulties -- how to fix a tool that's broken, who to ask for medical advices, what to do to release a pain, what they're short of and where they might find, and many more. Anakin is still in his art-smudged hooded jacket, but the whole vibe radiating from him seems so different -- less of a dreamy naughty artist, but a responsible leader that actually cares about people, helps people. Except, undoubtedly, evidently, he *is* a rebellion force now, from the Empire's perspective, gathering secret assemblies, encouraging the complaints toward the Empire, disassembling the hard-earned peace the Empire is trying to maintain. There is no defense for that.

Obi-Wan takes a candid photo from his hidden position, bites his lips, and goes back to continue staring at the scene. *Does he really have to take him in? But he doesn't seem to have a choice, does he? The order is quiet clear, so is the consequence.*

He remembers Count Dooku's figure, swaying before his eyes like a shadow, with a quiet but menacing tone: "If you fail, *I* will go to the Lower Level myself. Do you understand?"

His hands are clenched into fists with white knuckles again.

He's so focused in his thoughts now he almost doesn't realize since when the conversation and the assembly has stopped. People's talking voice die down like waning sea waves, but they're oddly not leaving yet.

Obi-Wan wonders what their next move is going to be, when the young voice echoes in the space, loud and clear: "How long are you planning on hiding there, Jedi Master Kenobi?"

#### draft notes

**flashback casual mention introduce past events:** ep2 timeline, Palpatine started clone war, had Jedi and senate all in control. ep3 timeline (current, 19 BBY), Palpatine becomes emperor, all uncooperative Jedi were persecuted or went hiding (e.g. Yoda/Windu disappeared) (=canon Order 66), remaining Jedi mostly get brainwashed/forced to become Palpatine's personal police force. Without Anakin, Dooku is still alive so far, active in conducting Palpatine's orders.

Anakin join/form/lead secret rebel force, starting with childhood friends (e.g. Kitster Banai, Wald, Amee), advocating rebellion with graffiti art

### Chap 4 (Choice)

> Obi-Wan knows about rebel force, is given the option of join them and fight against emperor and very likely die, or comply with Jedi brainwash doctrine and fight against rebels, neither know if he'd get harmed by rebels or he'd win and bring Anakin in, which would likely cause Anakin executed by Dooku.
>
> Obi-Wan's decision point, has to choose a side. He chooses them, is let go. start with only small help/subtle sign of slipping to their side, e.g. a few times when chasing around he actually already run into Anakin/could have arrested him but deliberately pretend as if missed. slow(/steep?) slip, every decision point actually all chooses Anakin, very clear starting to change side

The voice snaps Obi-Wan out of his thought. A flashlight flares at the corner he's hiding, blinding him for a temporary second.

Obi-Wan has no option but to comes out of the high maintenance platform, being in the center of the light and people's gaze. Now he knows full aware of the expression: "Like a deer in the spotlight." But he's not intimated by those people, he tells himself. Certainly not by this young man.

The crowd is quiet, so is their leader.

Obi-Wan approaches them carefully, just in case any sudden move from either side would turn this potentially, seemingly peaceful gathering into something far worse.

He stops two steps away from Anakin. The boy turns off his flashlight, regarding him seriously, meeting his eyes.

The silence increases the room temperature rapidly.

Obi-Wan has to clear his throat to break the awkwardness. "So you know I'm here," he blurts out, immediately feeling like a fool to note the obvious.

Anakin huffs a short laugh. "I thought you lost my invitation."

"Invitation?" Obi-Wan raises his eyebrows incredulously.

Anakin chuckles briefly. "How else could you find out we're going to meet here?"

Obi-Wan tilts his head slightly, "Those torn paper --"

Anakin raises one side of his eyebrows, suggestive, waiting.

Realization hits Obi-Wan. "Oh, Jesus, did you leave there on purpose? Is it a trap?"

Anakin proper laughs. "Bingo."

"Why?" Obi-Wan stares at him.

Anakin just shrugs. "You're looking for us, aren't you? Now you find us, what do you think?"

The look on his face is so difficult to read. Obi-Wan tries to find a hint of mischief or malevolence there, but he finds neither. The boy keeps his face straight, but his eyes, there is something deep and swirling in his eyes. Waiting.

*He's nervous.* Obi-Wan realizes. So are all the people in the room. He can barely hear anyone breathing.

Obi-Wan swallows, and shifts his gaze to the side. He starts slowly and carefully, "This is an unlawful gathering, and you know it. The Empire has long forbidden any type of underground meeting, with rebellious potentials."

The people around them start murmuring earnestly. Obi-Wan isn't paying full attention to their words, but he can already tell the tone isn't the most friendly.

Anakin holds out a hand to them, and the whisper quiets.

Obi-Wan glances at him again, and finds his gaze never sway. He feels himself unable to move or hide in those eyes. He finds himself *seen*, for the first time in a long time.

"Not just potential," Anakin challenges him. "You may call us a full-on rebel force. What are you going to do?"

Another quiet round of gasps around them.

The nervousness deepens into a dark undercurrent in his eyes. His voice may sound calm and confident, but his gaze says otherwise.

Obi-Wan doesn't know if his own eyes look exactly like that. He swallows again. "I can arrest you," he tries his best to speak in a business tone, nonchalant and robotic, like he's in auto-pilot mode, but his heart pounds loudly against his eardrums. He gives the crowd a quick look-around. "I can arrest all of you."

"I told you it's a bad idea, Ani!" Another young boy's voice shouts out angrily from his left.

"Not so quick, Kitster," Anakin answers him without looking. "Maybe he's not like them."

"Maybe I'm exactly like them," Obi-Wan retorts.

Anakin narrows his eyes, "Are you? Then why are you still standing here, instead of, I don't know, kill me or something? You do know if you arrest us, the only ending for any of us is death, right?"

Obi-Wan averts his gaze. "Maybe I heard some of you talking, maybe I'm generous enough to spare you this time, but don't mistake it for weak or pardoning from the Empire. If there is anyone else from the Empire knows about this, about you, then you're doomed. All of you are."

"But not you." A small grin sprouts at the tip of Anakin's lips. "I know you're different."

"Don't be so optimistic," Obi-Wan says grimly, feeling the wrench at his stomach twist even worse than before. "I'm trained with a code and a doctrine for my life, and my only order is for the people and the Empire to be safe, to keep peace. The moment you do anything endangering this peace --"

"I will," Anakin cuts him off, daring him again. "I'm telling you, Kenobi, there will be a day the people will rise against the Empire -- actually, it's the Empire that's against the people now." He takes a large step closer to Obi-Wan. The distance between them is less than a foot now. And he is a few inches taller than the Jedi master. "Then which side are you in, Jedi? Us, or them?"

Obi-Wan shifts uncomfortably. "Don't make me do this, Anakin," he says in a low voice.

"Join us," Anakin ignores his quiet uneasiness, flame of enthusiasm burning in his eyes. "Join us to free the people, fight against the unfairness, the Emperor, gives people the freedom back."

"Or what?" Obi-Wan takes a step back, distancing himself from the boy, shooting a quick glance at the surrounding again. Some people are fidgeting, hiding their hands behind their back, in a way as if they're gripping at something. Weapons, perhaps? Obi-Wan speculates. "Are you trying to imprison me or something?"

Anakin shakes his head with a small hint of frustration. "I wouldn't dare. In fact, I was just thinking if I fail on this bet, then that's the end of this, of me anyway. You may take me in all you want, and I'll just... get killed by the Empire or something."

Obi-Wan widens his eyes, once again thrown off-balance by the boy's boldness and straightforwardness. "You're betting your life on me?"

"Yes," Anakin answers without hesitation, and without blinking. Obi-Wan's heart skips a beat at the answer. The boy continues, "I'm trusting my feelings, and my feelings tell me you're worth trying. Don't prove me wrong, Kenobi."

Obi-Wan wets his lips. His heart continues beating too fast and too loud.

It seems forever until he can give an answer again.

"Obi-Wan," he says.

"What?"

"You can call me Obi-Wan," he tells him. "If you want."

The smile on Anakin spreads wide like sunshine shining through a flower field. "Thank you, Obi-Wan," he says whole-heartedly, letting out a long relieved breath.

"Now, go. Before the curfew starts or I change my mind. It's not my patrol tonight, and you definitely don't want to run into anyone else." Obi-Wan can't stop a similar small smile crawling its way onto his lips as well, seeing the relief and cheer on all their faces. People's murmuring grows louder and lighter, and they start moving out of the place.

Anakin doesn't move, not until all the rest have left the place.

"You should go, too," Obi-Wan reminds him. "It's unwise to step your toes on all the lines."

Anakin gives him a funny look. "That's the story of my life, you know."

Obi-Wan grimaces. "In fact, I don't know."

The boy is actually surprised. "Aren't you guys like, 'Big Brother is watching you' type? Knows everything about everyone?"

The rising tip of Obi-Wan's lips drops. He shakes his head briefly. "I have a feeling there is much misunderstanding."

"And *I*, have a feeling that you have something else you want to say, but not in front of everyone." Anakin observes.

Obi-Wan makes a sound out of his nose, bordering both impressiveness and annoyance. "How many 'feelings' do you have? Have some more, and you may call yourself a psychic."

Anakin shrugs uncaringly. "Mom used to tell me to trust my intuitions, and mine is usually quite good. Now, don't change the subject, what is it that's still bothering you?"

"Oh, let me see where should I start --" Obi-Wan says sourly. "I do this, we might very likely die before we can do anything. Do you have any idea how powerful the Emperor is, or the whole security and special forces are up there? How impossible it is to keep a secret from them, let alone a whole rebellious force? *And*, Count Dooku has given very explicit instruction, if I fail to seize the person behind those graffiti -- you, he'll come down here himself. By then, there will be no hope of speaking your way out of it."

Anakin listens carefully, tilting his head slightly in his deep thought. "Do you know how long we still have before the Upstairs notices anything?"

"Days, maybe weeks. I can't say for sure," Obi-Wan considers. "Patience is usually not one of their virtues."

Anakin snorts. "Do they have any, at all? Doing all these to us, taking away our freedom, our voice. You saw that, everyone with a heart would know how wrong that is. Do they even have a heart?"

Obi-Wan shifts uncomfortably. What Anakin described, isn't that exactly himself before today? Is that saying *he* also didn't grow a heart? Obi-Wan doesn't know what to answer, but luckily, it seems Anakin isn't waiting for one, either.

"Anyway," the boy wraps, "Good to know. We can still use whatever time we have to prepare."

"For what? What are you going to do?" Obi-Wan is suddenly tense again.

Anakin gives him a mysterious smile, "You'll see."

<br>

#### draft notes

some talk about trust issue, Anakin trusts his intuition, trusts Obi-Wan

after Obi-Wan actually changes his side, the addressing changes to Obi-Wan

### Chap 5 (Attraction)

> Obi-Wan takes more and more interest in Anakin, learn more about him and his past and ideation (Anakin talk about his childhood and why his interest in art), the two of them talk more, learn about each other more, start join rebellion meetings (start with only listen at outer rim, not speak), start secretly training Anakin properly, teach him use weapons and Force power.

*Maybe that's a bad idea,* Obi-Wan's mind wanders off. Now that he's back in the Upper Level again, sitting in the council room of the Imperial Palace, surrounded by shiny reflective walls and pillars, his mind clears. *God, what has him been thinking lately?* But maybe, maybe Anakin does have a point, instead of being clearer, his mind might just be more clouded when he's up here. It's so bright, with so much refined civility from everyone, he just can't see anything anymore.

"Do you have any findings during your investigation in the Lower Level, Master Kenobi?" Emperor Palpatine directly addresses him suddenly.

Obi-Wan is startled slightly, not expecting to be called out. "Nothing, my Lord," he answers too quickly, having to take a second to calm his breath, and then adding some more notes. "The people who created those art -- I mean, the disrespectful smudges and scrawls -- are very slippery and difficult to keep track of. I'm doing my best, and I will ensure to let Your Majesty know any progress when I have them."

"Maybe I should tend to the matter personally," Count Dooku comments on the side grimly. "Not to suggest your incompetence, Master Kenobi, but perhaps you can use some backup and support."

Obi-Wan answers hastily but carefully. "The proposal is appreciated, Count Dooku, but I believe that should not be necessary. I'm sure there are more urgent and higher priority tasks in the Galaxy that require your attention. I wouldn't think running around in those tiny dirty alleys would be the best use of your time. But I will guarantee to report to this meeting any and all threat to the Empire, as soon as I find any."

"Yes, you will," Count Dooku presses.

Emperor Palpatine pins his gaze on Obi-Wan for a second longer, before shifting to ask about the next pressing issue. While Count Dooku's eyes stay even longer.

Obi-Wan feels as if he's a fly caught by a spider net, or choked and strangled on the throat by the bare stare. His chest has barely enough air for him to breathe and survive the meeting.

He regrets coming in person.

After spending a whole week in the Lower Level, it's Anakin who suggested him go back to the Upstairs, just in case his absence has raised any suspicion. But the lack of progress is equally suspicious. It's unlike him to not able to capture a fugitive for this long, let alone just someone residing within Coruscant. Obi-Wan can't help but wonders how much further he can keep testing Palpatine and Dooku's patience.

They're running out of time.

<br>

Obi-Wan finds Anakin again, at the back alley opposite to the bar. The boy is painting a rainbow wing when Obi-Wan approaches him. He's humming some tune off-keys.

"Are you not going to escape?" Obi-Wan asks on purpose.

Anakin doesn't even bother turning his head. He's appreciating his new work, adding some stroke where it seem missing. "Are you going to arrest me?"

Obi-Wan sighs, "I really should say 'yes'. You never know, one of these days, I might change my answer, or it might not be me coming down here. You should be more careful."

Anakin stops the graffiti, wiping his paint-distained hand on a piece of ragged cloth. "Why, something happened? Does the Emperor suspect anything?"

Obi-Wan shakes his head. "That's the problem. I don't know. I can't tell. But they might be."

That's not anything new to either of them.

Anakin turns back to the painting, and asks him, "What do you think about this one?"

The pair of big colorful wings spread high and proud on the wall, leaving a small space in the middle where a person can just fit in and pretend those wings are their own. It's dreamy and beautiful. More artistic than most of the quick sketches Obi-Wan used to find on the wall.

"It's beautiful," Obi-Wan looks at the wings, thinking, wings means fly, fly means sky. They should belong to sky, where the sun can shine.

Anakin regards it for a minute in comfortable silence right on his side, then steps into the gap between the wings, spreading his arms. "I can fly now," he says with a grin.

The wings look so vivid as if they grow from his shoulder blades behind his back. The kid looks genuinely happy at this moment, Obi-Wan realizes. For some reason, it makes his throat thick and dry. He swallows difficultly around the lump, before managing to answer with a matching tight smile, "Yes, you can. You are."

Except, Anakin maybe have never even seen a real sky -- living in the under world, looking up only to an artificial sky, but he still dreams of such beautiful color and all those ideations. How can he keep doing that?

Obi-Wan wipes his eyes subtly, having to distract himself. "I didn't know the translation of this one though, it's not on your decoding sheet." He nods at the big wall paint, asking.

"Doesn't need to." Anakin turns back to look at it one more time before beginning to pack his scattering painting cans. "Everyone can understand it just by looking at it, don't you think?"

Obi-Wan has to agree. The art can speak for itself, so is the color. The wings can fly, people are dreaming of the sky that they're prohibited to see. The longing of the freedom, the dream and hope, the beautiful wishes, it's all right there. It's more powerful than any word could ever express. It's emotional in a way words can never achieve. It really is the best way of expression they can possibly find -- and the Empire deems it illegal, and he is a part of the forces that help it maintain that facade of peace and normalcy. Obi-Wan smiles bitterly.

All he can do is to take a photo of the art using his personal datapad, just so he can look at it whenever he wants, in case he forgets it.

Obi-Wan finds the boy squinting at his device curiously when he pockets it, but Anakin swiftly pretends he's just finishing up the tidy-up work.

"It's called a datapad," Obi-Wan says.

"I know," Anakin answers quickly, touching the back of his ear, turning to walk toward the street.

Obi-Wan trails him with a step's distance. "Hmm," he makes a mocking sound through his nose, "thought you'd say 'Never seen it before'."

"What do you think I am, a barbarian?" Anakin gives him a humiliated glance.

"And you're not?" Obi-Wan says deliberately, with a small hidden grin under his beard.

Anakin glares at him, "I remember *someone* said once 'there is much misunderstanding' between us." He mimics Obi-Wan's tone perfectly.

Obi-Wan rolls his eyes. "Well, I wouldn't know if you don't tell me everything about yourself."

"Same applies to you," Anakin bites back.

"Looks like it's settled then," Obi-Wan says, with a satisfied smile. "What about I buy you a meal, and let's talk."

Anakin stops his hurried steps to consider, then, "Dex's Diner," he demands.

"Deal," Obi-Wan agrees without hesitation.

"No deal if you're going in with these," Anakin squints at his armor.

Obi-Wan frowns slightly, self-conscious under his eyes for the first time in a long time. He tugs the skirt of his tunic. "What's wrong with my clothes?"

Anakin chuckles. "*What's wrong with your clothes?* You might as well print out the biggest sign saying 'I'm Emperor's Henchman' and stick it on your head. Do you want to get side-eyes wherever you are or what?"

Obi-Wan touches the empirical symbol on his shoulder, the one that usually reminds him of his high rank as general and usually offers a small amount sense of achievement, it now only triggers an uneasiness.

He takes off the brown tunic and the black armor, wrapping them like a bundle.

Anakin hands him a white jacket of his own from his bag, and taking the bundle to stuff everything back in.

"I want that back later," the kid says with a straight face.

Obi-Wan stifles a laugh. "Of course."

The jacket is a little too small for his size, and smells of cheap soap and a lingering smell of paint.

It smells of Anakin. Obi-Wan tries very hard not to think about any of that.

<br>

Dex's Diner isn't at the busiest hour when they go in.

The owner gives Anakin a warm welcome from behind the counter, and looks surprised to see Obi-Wan follow.

Anakin takes the two-seat booth at the far end of the diner, the farthest to the door and any other patrons.

Obi-Wan wonders if it's because the kid doesn't want anyone see them together, or just want their conversation to have some more privacy. He opens his mouth, ready to speak, but Anakin raises one finger, stopping him right on time: "No, food first. I'm starving."

When the droid waitress comes to their table, Anakin orders a whole lot of food that's enough to feed an army: the sliders, sandwich, steak, cheese dog. He passes the menu across the table with a gleeful smile.

Obi-Wan doesn't look at the menu, telling the droid, "I'll just have a cup of Jawa Juice, thanks."

He turns back to find Anakin studies him with interest. "What?"

"You know this place," the kid accuses, as if he's the one being scammed.

Obi-Wan shrugs slightly. "I've been here before, you know."

"I don't know that. And I bet it takes more than one visit to remember or have a favorite drink on the menu of a random diner on a random underground level." Anakin points out.

"Not random," Obi-Wan corrects him. "Just happened to be this exact place. My master used to come here, sometimes he'd take me with, but that's more than ten years ago now. Didn't they advertise to be the best diner in the underworld?"

Anakin grins. "They did! It used to be 'the best diner in the Coco Town', and now it's 'the best diner in the underworld'. I've always wanted to try here."

Obi-Wan almost blurts out "Why didn't you," but manages to stops himself at the last second. Looking at the kid's humble dressing and slim figure, he thinks he knows the answer already.

He glances at the diner's interior for a second, to cover the unnatural silence. It looks almost exactly the same as he remembers, only a decade older.

The droid FLO brings their drinks and the appetizer just in time.

Obi-Wan takes a swig at the drink. It also tastes the same as he remembers.

"So, you have a master," Anakin says carefully when he puts down the cup.

"Qui-Gon Jinn," Obi-Wan tells him quietly, suddenly realizing it might also be the first time in a long time that he mentioned to anyone anything from before all the craziness of the Galactic Empire started. And somehow, in front of Anakin, it feels easy to tell without feeling his chest too tight or his breath too difficult. "I lost him fourteen years ago."

"Same year my mom died," Anakin says. His Adam's Apple bobs up and down.

"I'm sorry," Obi-Wan says, and Anakin shakes his head slightly to dismiss it.

"It's been a long time now," the boy stares at an oily spot on the table, blinking slowly. "I don't think about that often."

"How old were you?"

"Nine."

"Oh God," Obi-Wan breathes out.

Anakin tries to smile a little but fails. "Must be why I can't really remember much."

*Might be a good thing.* Obi-Wan thinks distantly. At least he doesn't have to relive those horrible moments. He wonders if it's a terrible idea to ask "how," but the kid already starts talking regardless.

"Actually I can't remember most of the things before fifteen, but Kitster -- my best friend, we sort of grew up together -- he's the one that keeps a diary and has a good memory. I wouldn't know where I came from without him -- but it doesn't really matter now." Anakin drinks the juice again, finishing the cup in two gulps.

The sandwich is served with a side of fries, grease oozing through the paper napkin onto the plate. He grabs the wrap and starts biting.

"You're not born here?" Curiosity leads Obi-Wan throw out questions. He just wants to know more about this boy. One part of his brain is saying he's doing this just as a part of the investigation, he needs to know the basic information of his suspect one way or another; the other part... is making some very confusing disturbance that makes his stomach twitch and he tries to ignore it.

Anakin shakes his head with his mouth full. He answers after he swallows the bite: "Kitster said we were both born somewhere far away that even his mom didn't remember where, then when we were three, he and his mom, and me and my mom, were all sold to an underground black market art smuggler here in Coruscant, through a slave auction. Hutts on Tatooine were a really close bidder, but ended up not wanting to pay any more for us.

"I remember vaguely the house my mom and I used to serve had so many secret storage rooms with paintings and arts. We'd spend hours cleaning everything up and hiding them inside something else, so the master can smuggle them. People would come to the place, too. I didn't really have much to do, so mom encouraged me to pick up strokes and paints, just start painting on the wall of our hut. It distracted me from everything else, the work and everything."

"What happened when you were nine?" Obi-Wan takes another sip on the drink, and realizes it's empty already. He puts the cup down, eyes not leaving the boy.

"The smuggler died in some art dealer auction, I don't know. Kitster said there was some fight or fire, because some bidder wasn't too happy. Then someone was coming to burn our house, too. Mom took me and we just ran away. It must be too much chaos at that time, so no one ever came after us. We hid in the dumpsters and all those deserted houses, and soon after, my mom passed away."

"How?"

Anakin frowns hard at his food, his fingers holding the buns too tight that the ingredient and sauces getting squeezed out from the other side and dripping to the plate, but he doesn't seem to care. "I don't know. Cold, hot, sick, starve, poor. Do you really need a reason to die in places like this?" He looks up at Obi-Wan, his eyes dark and miserable. Pain.

Obi-Wan reaches out intuitively to land a hand on his shoulder, squeezing slightly. Without himself knowing why he's doing this.

"I'm sorry," he says. It sounds so powerless and pale.

Obi-Wan tastes nothing but bitterness on tip of his tongue.

Anakin shakes his head again, wiping the corner of his eyes with the back of his hand, covering the motion with a bite on the food, chewing it carelessly. Obi-Wan lets his hand slip.

He should have ordered something a little stronger, for a conversation like this.

"Who raise you up then?" Obi-Wan can't help ask.

"Me." Anakin answers with a mouthful, then explaining it longer after swallowing the food down. "There were a few others like us. I ran with Kitster, then there was also Wald and Amee. Kitster is the oldest, two years older than me, Wald and Amee are younger. A few others joined later. So we were like the parent of ourselves, stealing food, picking pockets, scamming, begging, picking dumpsters, getting into trouble, going in and out of jail. Honestly, I have no idea how we managed to survive for so long."

Obi-Wan swallows hard. This is nothing like what he expected -- but he also has no idea what he *should* expect, about a life in the underworld. He knows no one from around here, after all. He hates himself for not knowing any of it any earlier, and that no one on the Upper Level seems to ever care -- not even when they were still in the Old Republic, not even when he was studying in the Jedi Academy.

"I'm sorry," he says again. He seems to use those three words quite a lot tonight. And every time, it's as pale as it already is.

Anakin almost looks amused at his words. "What are *you* sorry for? It's not like you made any of that happen."

Obi-Wan gives him a guilty look. "I didn't know."

"But you know what's the best that life taught me?" Anakin says. Obi-Wan answers with raised eyebrows, waiting for him to continue. "Freedom. With everything we *don't* have, freedom is one thing we have too much. We can always go wherever we want, do whatever we want. Believe it or not, I still get to paint. If I can't find paper, I paint on the wall. If no painting cans, well, there's always something you can find to mix and make some color yourself. That's one thing comforted me and make me think of mom. It's only later we find out what else we can do with the graffiti."

Obi-Wan looks at the boy, the artist, the rebel leader, the orphan who raised himself up. Words roll out of his tongue without permission: "You're amazing."

Anakin has an odd look on his face. "Are you... are you flirting? D... Don't."

"No, sorry, I mean," Obi-Wan stutters hastily. "I mean it, in a not weird way."

Anakin laughs. "I'm kidding. Thanks, man. Now, your turn."

He finishes the sandwich, cleaning his fingers on the greasy wrapping paper, and starts picking the fries.

"My turn?" Obi-Wan blinks blankly.

"It's story-sharing time, is it not?" Anakin says in a granted tone. "So, what's your story? Born in the palace, wear gold-thread dresses, served by twelve servants to eat your breakfast? Something like that?"

Obi-Wan bursts out a laughter. "That's how you imagined my life to be?"

Anakin shrugs humorlessly, but one side of his lips has a slight curve. "No, that's the fairy tale that I stopped believing since three. But still, you're a myth, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You come out of nowhere, you want to catch me, then you don't want to catch me. You work for the Empire, but then you're not *really* working for the Empire. I told you I have a really good intuition, and it's telling me you're one of the good guys. So I gave you a chance, now I just need to know, who are you?"

Obi-Wan thinks carefully for a minute before starting. And he tells the boy: "I was brought to the Jedi Temple at three, became a padawan at thirteen, a knight at twenty-five, the same time when my master died. That was to save the Queen of Naboo, and our ship was hit and crash-landed on Tatooine, but we had no way of getting a hyperdrive to fix it. We stuck there for three days, and a Sith Lord caught up with us. We fought, he killed my master, and I killed him. We managed to leave in his ship. That's the same year Emperor Palpatine was elected the chancellor. Then we went into the war, and I fought and became a general at that time. And you know the rest, three years later, we won the war, but all we got was the Empire."

He pauses to catch his breath. He never expects to tell someone his life story like that, and he certainly never think it's actually not even that long to tell. He waits, feeling a scratchy sensation under his chest, unsure of what Anakin would make of it. He might be less nervous when he's waiting for the announcement result of his Jedi tests.

Obi-Wan really wishes he has ordered something, or just anything, to distract himself.

Anakin dips a fry in some brown sauce and just keeps in that posture, forgetting to eat.

"Cool," Anakin says finally. Simply. One word, one syllable.

He picks the damp fry up and eats it.

Obi-Wan narrows his eyes, not knowing where that annoyance rises from: "That's it? Cool?"

Anakin blinks innocently. "I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of hearing 'It's freaking awesome and I want to learn all the sword fighting stuff', if you're waiting for it."

Obi-Wan huffs out a laugh, his tensed muscle relaxes. "I should know. But listen, would it go from 'Cool' to 'Super cool', if I start teaching you 'all the sword fighting stuff'?" He raises an expecting eyebrow.

Anakin completely forgets about his free food. "You would do that?"

Obi-Wan shrugs as an answer.

Light of excitement gleams in Anakin's eyes.

"You can get 'Super freaking cool', if you do that," he grins.

#### draft notes

Anakin's childhood flashback and Obi-Wan's flashback of losing Qui-Gon:

Anakin at 3y: he and Shmi were not sold to the Hutts and Watto in Tatooine during slave trade, instead, they were sold to an underground black market art smuggler in Coruscant. Ani started learning/having interest in art by watching/witnessing/helping out those art transactions, Shmi encouraged him to learn painting, it distracted him from slave life.

9y: The smuggler died in some art dealer auction conflict shortly and they were let go in chaos (no one cared about them, not realized they're gone). Shmi died shortly after due to some sickness, Anakin grew up alone (with other homeless orphan kids, e.g. Kitster Banai, Wald, Amee) in lower Coruscant, managed to survive on his own in the hard life, did a lot of small outlaw things to support himself, steal/rob/pick up dumpster to get food/money/everything, ran away from police a lot, get into trouble a lot, still try to make art (initially because it comforts him and make him think of mom, later find out more practical usage.)

Obi-Wan at 3y: brought to Jedi Temple, became a padawan at 13y, became a Jedi knight at 25y, now: 39y

ep1 timeline (32 BBY, Anakin 9y, Obi-Wan 25y), without Ani, Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan didn't go into pod racing bet, didn't get hyperdrive to fix ship, stuck in Tatooine, got caught up by Maul. Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan 2v1 fought Maul, Qui-Gon/Maul died, Padme/Obi-Wan went back to Coruscant in Maul's ship, Palpatine became chancellor. Coruscant was in the corrupted, late Republic stage.

ep2 timeline (22 BBY, Anakin 19y, Obi-Wan 35y), Palpatine started clone war (22BBY), had Jedi and senate all in control.

ep3 timeline (19 BBY, Anakin 22y, Obi-Wan 38y), Palpatine becomes emperor, all uncooperative Jedi were persecuted or went hiding (e.g. Yoda/Windu disappeared) (=canon Order 66 at 19 BBY), remaining Jedi mostly get brainwashed/forced to become Palpatine's personal police force. Without Anakin, Dooku is still alive so far, active in conducting Palpatine's orders.

current: 18 BBY (1y after Empire is announced, 4y after beginning of Clone Wars), Anakin 23y, Obi-Wan 39y

### Chap 6 (Grow/Slow burn)

> The two become popular among the group, come up with actual real attacking plans, Obi-Wan give them useful suggestion to actually do some real rebel fight against Empire's controlled troops/facilities (use graffiti as cover/breach/signal) and win, slowly turn to new leaders people willing to follow.
>
> Obi-Wan meanwhile acts as their double agent in Jedi and near Palpatine. They planned to wait until Anakin is ready to make the final move on Palpatine, but Obi-Wan is already suspected by Palpatine

### Chap 9 (Success)

> The two back-to-back fight together, Anakin is forced to use left hand fighting, non-dominant hand but the move become unexpected, successfully kills Palpatine, they liberate the city, announce empire falls by drawing a huge blue graffiti on wall saying "Free". people want them be new leaders, they suggest building new Republic but need more help, sending out invite to hidden Jedi/senators in all plantes, inviting more wise people to reestablish democracy (e.g. look for Yoda, etc.). There are more work need to be done to build the new order, but good thing that they have each other.
