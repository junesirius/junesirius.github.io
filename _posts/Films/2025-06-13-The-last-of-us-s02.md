Thought it was just a zombie horror show, plus some action and drama, totally didn't expect myself to be touched like that and cry like a baby. The amount of emotions, the beauty in the girls' romance, the sexual tension, the raw feelings of everything, and the parenting. Cried so hard I can't keep hold of myself, be it yearning or triggering, I fell for it. It's brilliant.

### Dina (love)

Had to talk about Dina the very first. Oh beautiful, beautiful girl. Besides Charlie Bradbury, you are becoming the second girl I'm getting wet dreams about.

Like a thorny rose, beautiful, tender, soft, yet strong, resistant, loyal, warm, loving, caring, clever. You are a good friend before a good lover, you dream of a family, you love the way you see yourself loved, and you are loved by so many. You love everyone and they all love you -- which is sort of also why things are kinda messy in a very HBO way, but we'll get to it later.

You're everything a girl can dream to be and more. You're everything. Crazy, wild, free, dare to kiss when you want, dare to love when you want, you doesn't hide, yet sometimes you hide the most because you are scared. You are like a wolf, a star, all the best and most beautiful things I love the most. That's how much I think I'd love you if I was in Ellie's place. That must be how Ellie and Jesse and everyone else fall for you. How can anyone not love you after seeing you?

And that's exactly what scares me. It scared me from the very first episode that you'd die any time. You are so lovable and adorable and full of hope, and you're in a HBO zombie horror show where anyone can die at any second, who would be a better target than you? You are just so perfect that showrunners would love to see us fall in love with you then immediately kill you. Guess that's why I was trying to hold myself back, to not get too attached to you, to not get too heartbroken once that happened. It's almost like watch Game of Throne again, and I'm so sure every episode can be your last episode.

But then you beautiful resilient thing, you are so good at surviving. You survived the zombie siege on Jackson just by conveniently being away, you survived revengeful Abby and WLF, you survived and then you sneak out with Ellie again to the most dangerous place in the world because you love her. That is just so you. And so again, every episode since the two of you head out on the road again, I get worried about your life.

It would be a perfect and beautiful and heartbroken scene to kill you once you told Ellie you are pregnant (that's so messed up and overly dramatic and predictable, yet of course something like this just *has to* happen), or once the two of you had sex, or a heartwarming morning kiss, or shared the vision for your future, or after the "I love you"s. Or in that dark stormy night when you're left alone in the grand theater and all the good fighters are outside, leaving you the pregnant girl with a broken leg and a rifle, a barricaded door against all the armies and barbarians and zombies. It would be so easy to have you killed even without showing how, only for them to come back and find your broken bleeding-out body, even half-eaten, even beaten and tortured. It would have been so easy to hurt you and break audience's (me) heart.

Every time the two of you (especially you) are happy, I worry it could be your death. In a world like this, there is no happy ending, I was so sure, there is only pain and blood and loss and desperation. And it would only hurt more once you know how love feels like, once you know what you could have had and never would again.

So I guess, the twist is the opposite direction. You survived, days after nights, zombies after war zones, you survived, you fight hard, and you say "I can't die." Like Jesse pointed out, not "I don't want to die," it's "I can't die." So you won't. I'm so grateful for all the decision-makers and show-runners and scriptwriters for that, for the Gods that did not snuff out the light of your life, for letting you live. I'm so happy to see you alive until the very end of this season and wait for you in a new season on the horizon (though the last bit is still a little vague, with the very angry and revengeful Abby in the room threatening to kill Tommy, with Dina hidden in the makeup room, that seems quite unsure whether you survived Abby or not, we'll see.) I would really like to see you again in the next season.

### Dina/Mel (pregnancy)

The one thing I don't like about your story, is the pregnant part. Story-wise, of course that's what the writer would go, a happy family with a kid, it's like, so so certain a man or a straight woman wrote that story curve, as if the only happy ending for everyone has to be two people falling in love and having a kid. And they manage to solve that problem even if the two people here are two girls, they just, still managed to let them have sex and the girly one get pregnant, and Ellie would say *happily* "I'm going to be dad." while the child being Jesse's. Am I the only feeling it's just too messed up? Being poly and bi and gay is one thing, but this, isn't this a little bit too strictly copy-pasting a traditional heterosexual relationship template? Lesbian lovers don't *have to* have baby to feel fulfilled, and not all relationships *have to* follow one-male-role-one-female-role template. They can just be two girls falling in love. Think Ellie self-identifies as a she/her as well, not a he or they. So why the hell would they put the line "I'm going to be a dad" instead of two moms into her mouth. Anyway, just one small thing in the whole big beautiful thing that's been bugging me.

Love the parallel curve though, with Abby's friend Mel also being pregnant, she and Dina's fate become two exact mirrored life story, two pregnant women in the zombie apocalypse world, facing the anger of someone else, getting intertwined into wars that aren't exactly theirs. But just because they are kind and brave and always so supportive and loyal to their friends, they follow them everywhere, and maybe, very likely, facing the consequence that shouldn't be theirs to bear. But they made their choice.

Shocked when Mel revealed her late pregnant stomach, even more shocked when she insisted Ellie to cut the baby out in the last thirty seconds of her life. She's fading fast, but all she could think about is her unborn baby, she's still saying "You're doing so great" and "Is it out?" when she took her last breath. It took my breath too. I thought, for a tiny second, Ellie could do it, she could cut it like she could do it for Dina if it has to be done, like its *her* baby. And the finale would be Ellie holding the bloody newborn in her arms, crying desperately, taking the baby in and raising with Dina. That baby would have been a nice bigger sister (or brother, but prefer to think of it as a her) to Dina's baby, until one day she realized Ellie murdered her birth mother. Then there would be the whole cliche story curve again about that messed-up newborn, torn apart between Ellie's guilt and kindness all along when raising her up and the imagined coldblood when killing Mel. She wouldn't know whether to love Ellie or hate her, she might do something reckless, exactly like Ellie. The kid would be an exact replicate and mirror of Ellie, a sequel story, the new protagonist of a story for twenty years into the future.

But no, the writers refuse copycat. They obviously don't like a story curve that is so easy to imagine and predict and would flow on its own, so they killed the unborn baby. The little life that only has thirty seconds of chance of living. And become part of collateral damage and new burden of guilt on Ellie's shoulder (suppose she's not dead at the end of season 2).

Love the shock in Ellie when she realized what she did accidentally to Mel and Owen in her moment of panic. The lives fading, blood bubbling. Not just two, there are three. She's sorry, she's so sorry, she cried like never before, she's definitely seeing Dina in Mel's place and imagining what Abby would have done to her. She was so desperate wanting to fix her mistake too, if she could, if she knew how, if she had Mel's med knowledge, she would save her baby. She's so sorry, but sorry and shock is all she had left when Mel died. Love how she's totally immobilized when Jesse and Tommy found her and had to drag her away from the scene. She couldn't look away, couldn't breath, couldn't walk. She hates herself, and regret so so much.

This is beautiful, strong, heartbreaking, unexpected, emotional, twisted, apt story design right there. Admire the writers who thought and wrote that.

<br>

### Jesse (duty)

Now that we mentioned family life and pregnancy, might as well mention Jesse too. The invisible gene doner for Dina's baby and that's about it. He's there for everyone, for the town, do the construction and all the town job, being in the council, being the next leader of Jackson in line. But he's not really that involved emotionally. He's calm and dutiful, he's the adult in the reckless romantic story. He's the mind of the backbone of the story. So he's always so easily neglected from Ellie's POV, therefore from audience's POV.

Not fair to say he's not there for them. He cares for them, he cares for Dina, he cares for Ellie, he cares for the whole town. But that's exactly why. He holds too much duty and burden on his shoulder he can't be just a caring boyfriend figure for Dina or a big brother figure for Ellie. Or a good friend and coach. He *is* those roles, but he's not *just* those roles.

Guess that's why he also has that line of saying his love for Dina is different from Ellie's. And he for sure knows Dina's for him is likewise. Less burning like fire that can destroy everything. He's the family figure, the poster boy for good leader and man that cares about bigger picture and greater good, the one that can hold them together when the girls lose control of the situation. So story-wise, it is just so perfect to add him back into the story at the last period of time in Seattle, to save them when they get stuck in the middle of combat that isn't theirs, and then to die protecting them.

He's admirable, honorable, very decent, but his death is destined. His function is purposeful for the service of the story. Pity, but it has to be like this.

Even just for lesbian romance's perspective, there is no way to continue telling this story of it becomes the three of them living together -- how awkward would that be? So for the market, for the story, it would have to be just the girls, so he has to be taken out of the picture. The moment Dina told Ellie she wants a future with her, and Ellie said, "You, me, the baby, and I'm sure Jesse too, I mean it is his, right? We're all going to have a baby" (probably not exactly), that's Jesse's death sentence. They may have a future, but that future is almost one hundred percent not going to be all of them happily together. Sorry Jesse, necessary and destined sacrifice for a good lesbian story. You'll still be remembered by people of Jackson.

<br>

### Joel (parenting)

Knew for sure there will be topics of parenting and father-daughter relationships in the show, didn't expect it to hit so hard on me.

Not surprised to see from the beginning the two of them have gone cold and barely talk, living under the same roof but awkward. Classic adolescence and part of growing up, and for sure the way season 1 ended is going to explode, so it all fits quite well.

The first thing that throws me off is to deliberately design the story so that Ellie has to watch Joel being beaten to death, and continue to live. Lucky to not get spoiled beforehand that Joel would die, especially when that plot is in parallel with the zombie siege on the town, Joel was still helping Abby from being killed or infected or frozen to death, and using the radio trying to rush back to save the town, and the next minute, he's beaten to death. The whole scene, I thought there will be twist, he'd fight back, or Ellie or someone would just be in time to save him at the very last minute, something would happen to Abby or anything. Just, not like that.

Too brutal, too direct, too straight to the face purposeful purely for the matter of storytelling. It's like the logic of causality starts from the conclusion and the writers backtrack to force it to happen so the plots can smooth out (which, now that we can see it's forced, it's totally not smoothened out enough). The outcome of that scene has to be Ellie walking out of the room, traumatized, alive, had to head out for a journey of revenge on her own. So they backtrack to figure out a way to explain why Ellie is there, how she watched the whole thing, how she couldn't do anything, why Abby's gang didn't kill her and let her just go back home, and let the inciting incident for the whole new story curve begin. The "running into the scene just in time to watch him beaten to death" is just over convenient and forceful. Probably could have done better.

But the purpose is useful, and the continued Ellie's three months' recovery and mourning is great. Love seeing mourning scenes, always the strongest, most powerful, emotional, beautiful, and raw. Her hyper reaction, the mental replay, the forced pretended calm in order to be discharged, that fake smile to pass the psychiatrist dropping on her way out of the hospital, the performance is extraordinary. It's amazing to witness.

The bond between Joel and Ellie is always strong and beautiful, they're not really father and daughter, but like Ellie put it: "Whatever happened between them, he's always Joel, and I'm always Ellie." (probably not exact quote) which is THE most accurate way of describing their relationships. Especially when Ellie comes to adulthood, it does look like they are becoming more like allies than parent-child relationship.

But the flashbacks in the episode five, the memories for all the past five years they live in Jackson and all the attentive birthday gifts and cakes, those are definitely a father-daughter thing, and it's so so beautiful it's hurting deeply, hit me right to home. It's triggering, even, in a way. All the trauma and knots I never want to touch or look closely, they're right there ready to be exposed just by watching their interactions.

The vanilla birthday cake in the first year, the dinosaur and museum and space suit and the audio, the guitar with the moth carved in it. It's so so beautiful that's beyond my imagination. I cried so hard in this episode. THE absolutely most romantic, loving, caring thing one could have ever done in a world like that. Even in a normal non-apocalypse world, that's something difficult to beat. He gave her a dream to live with in a world like that, the world and life isn't ending just because of the zombies, there are still beautiful things to look forward to, there is a bigger world and universe out there. There are music, space, history, knowledge. He's teaching her everything he knew, about past, about future, about space outside their tiny small borrowed house. Even in a world like that, he's showing her a life, they still manage to have a life, instead of just surviving. That's just as beautiful as the strawberry scene in season 1. The beauty and hope of the life. Whoever thought of and wrote and designed those parts of plots are definitely someone who know how to live the life, can see the beauty of the world in any conditions, and if they have kids, they are really damn good parents.

The blow-up conflict starts from Ellie's seventeenth birthday -- which isn't exactly a surprise. The kid is not a kid, guess she never was, in a way. Joel's questioning is so classic: "So all the teenage shit all at once, huh? Tattoo, sex, smoke? Experimenting with girls?" The sexuality crisis, the coming-out story. I did not see that coming in a zombie disaster show. And it's so precious and beautiful and exactly what I want and could use. The universe is just being perfect, so well-timed for me that I'm feeling surreal for a moment just by typing these words down.

The coming-out wouldn't be easy, but it's still beautiful in all the ways. The first nineteen-year-old girl Ellie hang with, the tattoo artist, she's cute and lovely too. How could Ellie always bang the hottest girl in town? Anything to do with the protagonist's halo? (That girl also leads to the thought that: how can they possibly just have people with all kinds of professions and talents in this small town. Or is it just how the life made all of them to be, everyone *has to* have some way of earning their life, trading their special abilities for something else they need, the same way the primitive human inventing economy with trades and goods. The natural order that forces them all to contribute in a way or two, becoming the most versatile person they can be, the best version of themselves -- skill-wise. This is quite motivational too just to think about that, and stressful and terrifying. There is no wanderer in that society, you have to be able to give something to get something back. If I live in Jackson, what can I give to trade for food and shelter and all the necessities? Math or tech or writing? Which can fill my belly?)

Come back to Ellie and Joel, the sexuality crisis and conflict is just so expected. No way could Joel accept that on the first notice, and so very guaranteed that he'd react with anger as his first response, because that's just about the only way he know how to respond to something unfamiliar and new and terrifying, to a child he doesn't know what to do and how to raise. And that's when the really timed precious flashback of his own childhood and bring-up comes into place. His own father telling the story of his grandpa, the lesson of "Do a little better than my parents." It hurts, it hurts so much, and it's so touching.

He did great already, but of course there are still places he can do better. He made the mistakes because he loves her, because they stand in different shoes, coming from different background and childhood and practically everything possible. And because he's human. He tried his best, and the best of him did better than his dad.

The part of parenting talk, but only as far as to "You'll understand when you have kid." Guess it would work for Ellie, since with Dina's baby, she does will have a kid to raise. But it's just being too triggering for me. I've been trying very hard not to recall, to remember, to think, to deal with my issues and shits. At least now I get why last time in the video call, they quoted that sentence. Guess they tried their best too, and their best is better than their own life. And for some reason, they want some comfort and confirmation to know that's true. What can I say? What can I say? The fact I think I would never want any child and don't think I'd ever be a good parent, isn't that answer enough for what I think? But what can I say? How can I harm them when I know how harm feel like? How can I be cruel when I know how cruel can do and how it feels? All the harm and hurt and wounds and knots and trauma and bleeding, I'm bearing them all on my own. How can I talk? What can I say?

Anyway, love the episode five also because, it's so so comforting to see a rewind of what happened the night of new year ball. Even better, from Joel's POV. At least now there is some finality, some closure. It feels so much better to know that before Joel's death, they talked, they really used words and talked. There is no confusion, no lies. There are raw tears and hurts and more wounds, maybe hates too, but that's clarity, that's sincerity. They even teased around "Is Dina your girlfriend now", maybe not tease from Joel's part, he's genuinely asking, he's genuinely wanting to know about this side of Ellie. He's accepting it, actively. His way of saying his support, his gesture. It's so beautiful, it's so great, it's so comforting.

Regret and begrudge and misunderstanding, all those things that can make an open wound never healing, the mourning of loss never stop hurting. But at least, with these small shots and small gestures, they had the chance of making peace and understanding before Joel's death. So Ellie's revenge and love are pure. That's so good. Love it.

<br>

### Tommy (family)

Tommy, Joel's little brother. Think he's in the first season too but never paid enough attention, barely remember his face and name, but in this season, he's impressive.

He's strong, he's kind, he's the leader of Jackson. He's actually the real leader of his people now. And they hold strong fort against enemy and zombies. They have protocols and rules, the town has counsels to discuss proposals. That's a whole civilization developing. And Tommy is in the front of all that.

Totally different from some vague early impression of him being the weak brother that always need Joel's protection with all the shitty bad habits. Might be true when younger, but he's grown so much, and he's so amazingly becoming the source of sense of security for the town of Jackson. Not just for the people in town, even for me. Seeing him working around, helping around, discussing the matters, making the town a better human civilization reservation, it feels so safe, so comforting, so happy. He did great.

And then there's the scene during the zombie army siege. It's terrifying. The leading zombie is just giant, and his wit, his sacrifice, his love for his wife, his pure luck that obviously is just creators (Gods of this world) don't want to take him out of the story just yet, the tension and storytelling is great.

Then the counsel scene of deciding whether to revenge Joel (by the way forget to mention Ellie's speech in that scene is so beautiful and great, some of the sentences maybe can even be quoted later in other works, "It's not revenge, it's justice", this practically can be used in every single revenge-based character stories, so calm and sensible and reasonable in such a tense scene, the design is amazingly great), the heartbroken, the shaking torn-apart between love for the town and for his brother, I'd want to guess he's one of those three people who voted yes. The voting counting process is also really really great, we as the audience are holding our breath and counting just as intensely as Ellie and everyone in the room. And the result, shouldn't exactly be surprising, is still disappointing.

The last impressive scene for Tommy is in Seattle. The radio said the unknown sniper is cornered and both troops are rounding him. And moments later, we see him and Jesse dashing into the aquarium to save Ellie. Ellie and Jesse were initially heading out to save Tommy, but it all ended up becoming Tommy saving them. How does that happen? How on earth good is him now with hunting and shooting? Being able to sniper down all the WLF militaries and Scar's arrows, he must be damn good in combatting. Strong and determined, and the fact he and Jesse both sneak out of the town to save Ellie and Dina, he's kind, clever, organized, concerning, warm, loving, and most of all, he's family. He's family to Joel by blood, he's family to Ellie and Dina and Jesse and everyone in town by choice.

He's similar to Jesse in a way that both of them are getting dutiful and burdened by the responsibility to more people. But Tommy's different in the way Jesse never will -- he's Joel's blood. Which means all those anger, quiet violence, the strong mind, the wildness, those are in him too. He can be young and reckless, he's just choosing not to be now. But given chance (Abby is giving them really good chance now), he'd go on adventures with Ellie and Dina just like when he's young, pretty sure about that.

<br>

### Abby (anger)

About Abby. Honestly probably had to review the first season to remember everything about Firefly to understand her fury fully. Only remember the facts now without feeling her loss emotionally, it's very difficult to relate with her pain. Especially when the whole story is mainly from Ellie's POV, it's getting even harder to sympathize with her. So all she shows up to be is just one angry revengeful little brat that doesn't care about her friends' lives that want to add on the pile of trouble Ellie and our good guys already have. It's not fair, I know, she had her pain and loss and motivations, she wouldn't have done those things if Joel hadn't done his, it's a chicken-and-egg loop between right and wrong. And there really is no right and wrong, everyone is trying so desperately hard to hold on to something most valuable to them, and sometimes people's valuable things are just so conflicted. So there she is, all messed up and pitiful, alone and lost, revenging on our most beloved past-protagonist -- and succeeded.

But still surprised me to see her torture Joel like that. Like Supernatural always said, revenge never makes things right, and you don't feel better even after you achieved what you set out to do and your target suffered the way you want them to. You wouldn't feel any better after that, the loss wouldn't feel any less painful and hollow. The hole and the wound would always be there, forever.

So that's how Abby is. The empty shell. The revenge is cruel and brutal, asking Ellie to watch is unthoughtful, letting Ellie continue living is disqualifying as a villain except she's not a villain figure, not really. She's just one of so many people getting hurt by the messed-up world and get caught in between the tide of time and history. She's not fully in control of her life. Not the death of her father, (is there a younger brother too?), not the death of her best friends Mel and Owen (the fact she revenged them by killing Jesse and almost(?) Ellie means she still cared about them, makes her more human, but no less bloody), she's just forced by the fate to take these and taking out on other people in ways she can.

She's strong, determined, but also simple-minded. She's not exactly strategic. She might be clever (has to be, to survive there), but during the revenge, she didn't show much intelligence. She doesn't listen to her friends (very barely, like when they try to convince her give up on revenging Joel, but listened to not kill Dina and Ellie).

She's just a pile of angry, mourning, painful mess. Not even sure the very ending and WLF's people (Isaac, mainly) insist she can be the new leader. If she does, wouldn't be surprised the new WLF would become a complete monarchy structured society -- as opposed to Jackson's democracy (Is this exactly how economics and politics evolve in history? Apocalypse world is like a very initial petri dish for human society, and we're enjoying watching how everything start forming and evolving). It does fit WLF's military background though, after all, those good little soldiers are just listening to leaders. They're followers, and a reckless hot-headed girl that does know how to think (occasionally) seems to be an obvious choice of natural leader -- they're so fucked.

<br>

### WLF vs Scar (humanity)

Didn't expect the setting for Seattle to become the center battlefield for two major different power groups at war. The zombies are not even their biggest threat anymore, other humans are -- like they always are. So much worse than zombies. It is such great portrait of real humanity -- humans love conflict, they'll jump into wars when they can find an excuse, and a target. And now they have it.

The design for the other side is a little bit too deliberate -- made them into figures as far as possibly can on the spectrum of difference. They're primal, speaking in whistles, religious, none of modern technologies, still using bows and arrows to attack, living in woods and islands. And WLF has best tanks and radars and walkie-talkies (just far too convenient for our protagonist to snatch and go and follow up everything that's happening on the board, almost giving them a god view in the world, convenient for story-telling.)

And of course those two groups of people should fight, the conflict would deteriorate, truce would be violated, and it would make Seattle a full-on battlefield (Is Chicago better or worse? Both are reflecting big dark bang groups, I guess? Chicago still running by five monster families?) Good for the game-designing, good for story-telling and show-making, good for drama purpose (see? Just said, human mind love watching drama and tragedy and darkness).

Love their lines: "What's wrong with Seattle?" When Ellie etc. have to witness and dodge and survive a full-size battle in the middle of roads, both sides start flesh-on-flesh fighting. *What's wrong with Seattle?* Oh nothing, just humans, should know by now men are worse than zombies.

<br>

### Jeffrey Wright (familiar face)

Saw Jeffrey Wright's face again and got distracted (consequence of those other characters being just too memorable, or he's just having a really memorable face), is it because of the outfit or anything else I don't know. Just know that face too well, from The Hunger Games and Westworld, he's like THE symbol of rebellion. Like, say, there are young boy figures nowadays that represent freedom, name one. Who could possibly become more recognizable than that guy? Watching his face -- with glasses on, especially -- and we'd already know he'd do something, making an action, and fully turn into a rebellion -- he's rebellion everywhere, he's going to be one everywhere.

So yeah, his face, is just so iconically, so conveniently got linked to the symbols like freedom and rebellion, that it should have a warning sign on his face that says "spoiler alert."

The character's rebellion journey becomes completely useless now -- we'd already know what to expect and what's promised to deliver. It's treat.

<br>

### Jenmish (Easter Egg)

Some small side track distraction is caused by false advertisement and over wishful thinking. Tumblr and Instagram got excited when spn official accounts help advertising TLOU2, and because of the easter eggs in the game, we're all sorta expecting to see some Jenmish, more or less. We (I mean I) stared way too  hard at each frame, not even dare to miss any flashing frame, just in case the two of them are actually in that crowd of thousands of zombies (they could still be, and we might never know). Or a scattered letter on the floor that got neglected in a millisecond. Can't say not disappointed to not find anything, still convinced "cockles is cannon in TLOU". Like the meme said: "cockles will reunite in spn s16 first -- no; cockles will reunite in The Boys s5 first -- no; cockles will reunite in TLOU s2 first"

Want to play the game even more now with that easter egg in mind. Really good advertisement and motivation in both directions.

And still fully convinced that beautiful rock band poster on Ellie's wall, that's them. Wish someone could just ask them that question in some coming comic con and get a final confirm, that would be awesome. Praying hard now for it to come true.

<br>

PS: A small note, forgot to mention between Ellie and Joel. When Joel asked the therapist doctor if it's a symbol of reborn, of new life, and Gail told him, "It's death." And he goes still, just, "Oh." Love the death mention, love Ellie for drawing that and not hiding her love to it, love Joel's desperate forced positivity, and his sad hurt after the truth. It' beautiful, everyone is beautiful, every emotion is beautiful.

PPS: Love the depiction of all the supporting small characters in Jackson as well.

Gail, on and off, sometimes (mostly) just to be useful for the plot purpose, but also vivid, alive, pissed.

Eugene, heard his name mentioned by others at least three times before finally showing the real him. Love the way of casually keeping him loosely within the plot's reach, side reflecting his personality from people's memories, and then reveal the big conflict scene of his death. The trigger for the new round of heavy  angst. Totally didn't expect him and Gail married, but it made so much sense considering how Gail never had a good face to him.

Seth -- start with a wrong foot but turn back to be a really good ally. Has flaws especially when he's drunk, has a real, over-heated, burning heart (and head too). The character introduction and curve development is amazing.

P3S: Love so much to a gaping mouth: the cinematographic design of Eugene's death scene. No gun shot sound effect, not Joel or Eugene's POV. No direct fear or conflict or pain or guilty. Just a wide shot, a beautiful scene of the mountains and lake, just the calming peaceful nature, and then birds fly out of the woods. The frame is quiet, so is the sadness and after-shock. The pain burns low and slow, like all the emotions are buried by Joel or Ellie.

They are the kind of people who keep the outside calm and blank whatever's been happening inside, how broken or how many pieces they fell apart to, they keep that face with them, like the beautiful scene. And then, the blood and loss, are merely birds startled out of the woods. It's just too beautiful, too powerful.
