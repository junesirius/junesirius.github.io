\- You act like religion is for suckers, but there it is. Evidence. How can you still be so cynical?

Oh, wouldn't it be lovely if I wasn't?

Could've been a better man if I hadn't seen it all.

Yes, angels exist. Sound the bloody trumpets.

As for religion, yeah, all right, be nice to your neighbour and all that, but... the world isn't all puppy dogs and rainbows.

Can't just pray evil away. Still have to fight, hard, on our own.
