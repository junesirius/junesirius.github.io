Crying.

miss a hug like this so much

配乐的歌词也超级赞：

> Did you ever feel your heart broken?
> 
> Did you ever feel it's the end of the world?
> 
> The bells are ringing, but the blood's stop pumping
> 
> As I feel the weight of the fall
> 
> They say help is near, but no one here can feel our fear
> 
> It's a minefield, us, it'll never disappear
> 
> Cause you take me back, you take me back
> 
> I'm your kamikaze
> 
> And tonight's the night we might fall together

这种拥抱，这是失而复得的拥抱。
