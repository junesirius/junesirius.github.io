So much joy and so much pain.

Pain.

"I know you are a good kid. It's not your fault. It's the demon that makes you like that."

Pain.

Unbearable pain.

Why can't you just admit it. Why can't you just accept her as she is. Why must deny. Why must protect the perfect kid figure in your imagination. Why. Why.

That is the day, all the darkness comes in.

That is the day, all the pieces no longer stick together.

That is the day that changed everything. Everything.

Nothing is ever the same. Nothing.

And it's buried. Deep, deep down.

Didn't understand what I agreed with. Never talk, never tell. Just bury.

The hurt is buried.

The pain is buried.

But it's hurting. It's still painful as fresh. And more.

It never heals.

And it becomes worse, because no one to tell, no one to share the burden, no one to comfort. No one to help heal.

The pain goes down and down. Deep. So deep. It grows to the bottom of heart.

Pain. Unbearable pain.

Why can't you just admit it. Accept it. Why must you deny.

Even the heartbroken is so much better than denial.

You protected yourself. You hurt me so so deep.

Nothing has ever been the same after.

I already forgave. But I can never heal.

Never.

<br>

Of all the people, of all the time, we meet, get to know each other, to love.

<br>

Everything, everywhere, all at once.

It is in the instant, where we can find eternity.
