### S01E08 关于嫉妒

> You're finally getting in touch with your emotions, letting your barriers down.
> 
> \- You see, that's part of the problem. I'd like them back up, thank you. Because these emotions are... bloody inconvenient, that's why.
> 
> \- The Devil doesn't get jealous. I'm the one who inspires passion in others.

——————

（Dr. Linda Martin的高超话术：）

> I find people who are rude usually feel powerless in their own lives. Terrified of not being in control. But that's not you, I'm sure.


### S01E09 神父

> You sound... lonely.

A friend = A peer you respect, someone you like to spend time with, someone with whom you share a meaningful connection.

——————

> We all have demons inside.
> 
> We might not always understand it, but God has a plan.
> 
> \- Yes, I know. But why does everybody always think it's a good plan?

——————

> \- Please tell me you didn't come out here to talk to him.
> 
> God? This is as good a spot as any.
> 
> \- Does he ever talk back?
> 
> I don't need to hear him to... hear him. If you know what I mean.
> 
> \- Well, yes, he never talks to me, either.
> 
> \- Some people are just... beyond saving.
> 
> That's where you're wrong. There's still hope for him.
> 
> \- How can you still have faith in this boy?
> 
> God has faith in him. In all of us. Even in our darkest moments.
> 
> \- You really believe that.
> 
> I do. Why don't you?
> 
> **\- Because he didn't have faith in me.**
> 
> I felt that way once, too. But now I know, deep in my heart, God has a plan for me.
> 
> \- Oh, his plan for me was quite clear.
> 
> How do you know it's finished?
> 
> Remember, Lucifer, your father... has a plan.

**路西法的控诉：**

> You, you cruel, manipulative bastard!
>
> 你这个冷酷无情、爱操纵人的混蛋！
>
> Was this all part of your plan?
>
> 这都是你的计划吗？
>
> It's all just a game to you, isn't it?
>
> 这一切对你来说就是个游戏，是吗？
>
> Well, I know punishment, and he did not deserve that.
>
> 我了解惩罚，而他不值得承受这一切。
>
> He followed your stupid rules, and it still wasn't good enough!
>
> 他遵守了你愚蠢的规则，可是却仍然不够！
>
> So what does it take to please you?
>
> 到底要怎样你才满意？
>
> Break your rules and you fall!
>
> 违反你的规则就要堕落！
>
> Follow them and you still lose?!
>
> 遵从它们却仍然要输？！
>
> Doesn't matter whether you're a sinner!
>
> 不管你是不是罪人！
>
> Doesn't matter whether you're a saint!
>
> 也不管你是不是圣人！
>
> Nobody can win, so what's the point?
>
> 没人能赢，这有什么意义？
>
> What's the bloody point?
>
> 这一切又有什么意义？
