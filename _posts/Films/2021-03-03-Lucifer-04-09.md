（How to forgive myself）

> I know why I hate myself, because everything I touch, I ruin. From rebellion against Dad, to now. Look what I put you through. 
>
> I hate that I am poison for anyone who dares to care about me. Especially you.
>
> \- Lucifer. This isn't about me. I'm ok. I haven't crumbled into a million pieces. I'm still here. And I'm fine.
>
> If I turn around, will you be fine or will you look away in horror?
>
> \- It doesn't matter.
>
> 'Cause it does, Detective.
>
> \- No, it doesn't. Because it isn't about me. This is about you. I'm not gonna let you use me as an excuse to avoid dealing with what is behind all of this.
>
> \- You always talk about how much you hate about being blamed for humanity's sins. You know, "the devil made me do it." And I think I know why you hated it so much, because deep down, you blame yourself just as much, if not more.
>
> \- You have to stop taking responsibility for things you can't control. 
>
> \- Lucifer, you need to forgive yourself.
>
> I can't. 
>
> \- Why?
>
> I don't know how to.
>
> I don't even know where to begin.
>
> But... I want to.
>
> \- Lucifer, I think you just took the first step.

So did I...

I can't. I don't know how to. I don't even know where to begin.

But... I want to.
