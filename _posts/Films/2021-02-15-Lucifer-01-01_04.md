### S01E01 关于Evil

> How do you think I am the Devil because I am inherently evil, or just because dear old dad decided that I was?
> 
> 你觉得我成为撒旦是因为我生来邪恶，还是我们亲爱的老爹决定如此？


### S01E02 关于insecurity

> 说实话，我最喜欢堕落天使这个称呼，但那都是以前了，如今大家都称我为路西法（These days you just have plain old Lucifer）

——————

> \- And you've left Hell behind to take a vacation in Los Angeles?
> 
> \- Well, where else would I go?

——————

> （被指出喜欢用幽默掩饰不安（hide insecurity in humor））
> 
> \- What do you think I'm insecure about?
> 
> \- That you are changing, but that you don't know what's causing the change. Or who.

——————

> 你曾是上帝的天使中最闪亮的那一个，路西法（You were once the brightest of all of God's angels, Lucifer.）
> 
> 上帝又不是没派过他最喜欢的儿子去统治地狱，对吧？（It's not like God sent his favorite son to reign over Hell before, is it?）


### S01E03 关于fake, lie

> 我终于明白我父亲对那些伪神的抱怨了（Finally, I get my father's beef with graven images.）
> 
> 这是一个建立在谎言上的城市，没什么是真实的（This is a place built on lies where nothing is authentic or genuine.）
> 
> 你说这里的人都很假，但我觉得人们来这里是为了改造自我（You say people are phony here, but I think people come here to reinvent themselves.）

——————

> 我只惩罚有罪之人


### S01E04 关于power, control, influence

> It's not that you're afraid that you don't have power over Chloe, it's that you're afraid that she has power over you. But neither one is true.
> 
> 你害怕的不是你无法影响克洛伊，而是你害怕她对你有影响。但二者都是错误的。
> 
> People don't have power over us. We give it to them.
> 
> 别人不能影响我们，而是我们甘愿被影响。
> 
> You have to take your power back.
> 
> 你要把你的影响力收回来。
> 
> You're right. It's not her, it's me. I need to take back control.
> 
> 我需要重新找回控制权。
> 
> I need to behave like I always have.
> 
> 做回从前的我。

——————

> Let's say you really are the Devil, all-powerful, immortal, blah, blah, blah.
> 
> 假如你真的是撒旦，无所不能，不死之身什么的。
> 
> Does that mean you don't feel pain at all?
> 
> 这是否意味着你根本感觉不到痛苦？
> 
> Well, I... I do feel something, but it's not pain so much as, uh, a pressure, a nuisance, really.
> 
> 我会有一些感觉，但不像痛苦那么强烈，更像是压力或是针刺。
> 
> I do believe there's good and evil and right and wrong, but the whole fiery damnation thing, no.
> 
> 我相信世间有善恶与对错之分，但那套下地狱什么的我完全不信。
> 
> Does it scare you?
> 
> No, I mean, how could I be scared of something that I don't believe in?
> 
> Do I scare you?
> 
> No.
