很满意第六季的质量之后在看之前就提前先瞟了一眼第七季的评分，发现甚至比第六季的平均评分更高，于是有了更高的期待。很满意仍然没有失望，很优秀的设定，很优秀的讲故事口吻，优秀的剧本和拍摄和情感和讽刺。忍不住想，之前几乎要断言在2020之后很少再看见什么优秀作品了，黑镜这两季似乎就是用来证明我的错误。仍然有好的剧本，有好的作品，只是需要去找到它们。

也可能，“没有好故事”这条只适用于好莱坞，在世界其他地方，比如英国，仍然有好的作者能写出好的故事。Offence intended. 果然全世界还是英国人最擅长嘲讽和黑色幽默，擅长疯狂的想象力和讲故事。And I wonder why.

### 701 Common People

Absolutely amazing episode, brilliant, genius, sarcastic, realistic, everything one would look for in a Black Mirror episode, and it gives us more than we ask for. 果然不愧是整季评分最高的一集，没法用语言表述和赞美它的genius。It's just absolutely THE best sarcastic story ever watched. 过分现实，过于容易地relate，任何一个转折都能看见现实的对应。Just can't say it enough this is brilliant.

从广告植入开始，一步步逼迫着升级subscription level。“You can absolutely keep the basic subscription, but the higher subscription would have this and that benefit”，they promise more and better features, and the old ones are just getting more miserable. You want anything more, you just have to upgrade. And after you upgrade, there are just more tiers waiting for you, “the higher tiers are now the standard, and there is lux tier that gives all the best experience and everything you would want.”

They made it sound like optional, but they really aren't. The inserted ads ruined your job, your life, you can't live without upgrading, but you can't get money for it.

看的时候联想到了太多太多用unbearable ads试图把人从basic tier往更高级subscription驱逐的例子。最先想到的是多邻国和油管，already annoying, but not anywhere near life-threatening level, but already can see the similarity. The business needs benefit, if they can't get it from subscription, they get it from ads. I can understand where the ads come from, but it's not making it any less hateable. And the episode shows it absolutely in the most brilliant creative way.

通过暗网do crazy things to earn quick dirty money, that's just the second thing that shows how awfully dark humanity can get, and how easy to get your life fucked up. 男主的人设，he's just an honest man, a loving husband, poor but supportive. 暗网是走投无路之后的快速来钱渠道，and the beginning of the long steep fall into the hole. 这集讲故事的视角用的是最简单的铺垫，the things he once disgusted, the casual pass-through lines of what crazy things people are willing to do, all become exactly what he did. His life is fucked completely when he had to get a quick income from removing the mask. He lost his job from there, and to get more money, he'd have to do more crazy shit. Round and round again, it's an endless pit, a vicious cycle. A hopeless life of an ordinary man in the face of capitalism. Exactly just how the world driving ordinary family apart. They don't stand any chance.

The scene with selling the cradle is brilliant. "Good luck with the new baby." "We are not having kids." "Then what do you need the cradle for?" "We're shooting a music video. We need to set it on fire." Brilliant, brilliant design. It's absolutely the best design for the cradle's ending. For their broken hope and dream. There won't be a kid between them. They hold on to the future for so long, until the reality finally comes too heavy, they finally have to use the baby fund, then sell the last thing they hold on to, the cradle. And it's not to become a hope for a different family, it's just going to be burnt down to ashes, for a group of hippy artist, for their artistic music video. There is nothing more fitting than this for the cradle. There is nothing more sad for their story.

The choking and killing comes inevitable. However deep he's in love with his wife, the moment they run out of the subscribed lux package, the moment she starts the endless ads again, he had to do it. They both agreed the inevitable ending, so it's not murder, it's survival. At least one of them have to be able to live on. It's heartbreaking, it's painful, it's a powerful ending. It induces thinking, reflecting on our real world. And the fact that there is nothing we can do even if we recognize the problem, it's even sadder and powerless and hopeless.

Black Mirror is indeed very good at making audience feel sad and powerless and hopeless. Very depressing, very sadistic, very tragic. Very much just the life and world itself as is, as we live in. Cruel as always.

### 702 Beta Noire

一个多元宇宙故事。近些年来的热门主题，算不上特别新颖的设定。

内核是一个反抗bully的revenge故事，仍然算不上特别新颖。

所以这集大概只能算是okay-ish的程度。尤其是跟第一集一对比，只能算是平均水平。

在multiverse设定出来之前稍微有些悬疑的感觉，不太容易往那个方向想，揭露了之后倒也是意料之外情理之中。然后发现设定上又是用到了quantum computer，突然笑出声。就像601 Joan is Awful那集一样，the myth of what quantum computer can do is just going to keep getting more mythical by each episode and each season.

稍微有点《Everything, everywhere, all at once》的既视感，but not as good。Bully revenge的故事内核限制了整体的深度上限。Not born in the culture, not having a first-hand experience with high school life here, so can't really feel very related to the core emotion here.

结局稍微有些刻意的黑镜化，like they try to decide what's the most Black Mirror ending they can possibly come up with, and they come up with the Queen of Universe. It's unexpected in a very expected way. So it's actually kinda unimpressive. (The audience are definitely getting picky with all the unexpected endings we have been given all these years with all these Black Mirror stories.)

### 703 Hotel Reverie

这季里除了701的absolutely favorite story. 701的震撼来自故事的嘲讽性，这集来自所有beautiful emotion and lesbian moments. It's unbelievably beautiful, amazing, awesome, breath-taking. Love it so much.

特别特别喜欢这集的老电影质感。就像605的上世纪设定，这集的剧中剧也是老电影质感。果然每次一回到上世纪设定就会抓住我，就像304。这集的女同getting together蒙太奇发展也是非常有304的感觉，可以说这集是除了304之外第二个让我喜欢到那种程度的黑镜剧集了。共同点都是有女同。

但又不止。这集也有科幻元素，just like all the Black Mirror episode usually do. 进入VR式的剧中剧老电影，和AI-generated character互动，只不过it's not just a machine getting self consciousness, it's actually more like a shadow of a human getting copied inside. It's real, the emotion is real, the love is real. The feelings are real. Which just make the story all the more sad.

The memory wipe is heartbroken. Unbelievably sad. But inevitable. How else can they move the story ahead if they didn't wipe her memory, reset and remove everything? How else can they make the story the saddest, as most Black Mirror episode seems to aim to do? Brady might can get trapped inside the machine world, her body die slowly outside, living a happy life inside with a girl she never met in real life. Or she can come out, being the only one left remembering what she once had, and could never ever get again. The loneliness is unspeakable. The memory being everything she had left. There is just no happy ending possible for this story. Love the ending we get all the same. Love story is always so easily become tragic sad story, but no less beautiful and powerful.

Love the film in film setting. Love all the tech people and directors in the story. Only a writer knows how difficult it is to fix loopholes, every small detail can affect the story, everything needs to be tied together, you get one small detail wrong, you'll need a whole lot to steer it around again. The writer of this episode knows far too well about the pain of loopholes. As a writer myself, I can feel it so deeply, relate it so deeply. Every single plot has its purpose, every little creature like a dog and a passer-by character has their purpose, all tied together like a cobweb, the exquisite rigorous logic of one thing leading to another, that's the beauty of good story-telling. That's what I enjoy to design for my stories, that's what I always love to see in stories I read and watch.

The phone ring scene at the end of episode, it's a great beautiful saving for the whole sad ending, trying its best to turn it around to be a hopeful ending. But I wonder if it's trying too hard out of its way. Like, I wonder if that foreshadowing scene in the beginning where Brady saw the screen test clip, is just purposefully prepared for this ending. I wonder how the writer comes up with this ending, did the ending idea comes first and then goes back to insert the accidental running into the clip, or that test clip comes first, and the ending is just inspired by that.

The other very good foreshadowing example is about that spilled coffee. It just needs one passing sentence to mention coffee's existence, one that the audience might not pay much attention, but without that, the accidental knocking the coffee and destroying the server won't come so naturally. It's like one of those scriptwriting class instruction, and the improv performance instruction: you call back something that happened three scenes ago, that's how you amaze audience with the complete structure. Don't do that too far away in scenes because they'd forget it already; don't do it too close because it won't be much of a surprise when it's still fresh. Do it three scenes apart, and it will get you the surprised amazed cheers. The coffee line is just a good example, and there are so much more example in this episode. Practically every plot has a foreshadow.

Overall, love this story so much. Love it as much as San Junipero. The lesbian romance is always the most beautiful, romantic, amazing, touching, enjoyable thing to watch. I just hope there could be more like this.

The very only downside of this episode, is probably just the actress doesn't feel very good at acting. The vintage old movie actress is amazing, elegant, beautiful, just all the most classic movie vibe beauty. While the new era so-called big name actress, Brady, comparatively is so stiff, with only about one set of facial expression, always confused, surprised, stiff, trying to play the male part in a lesbian relationship. Just a little out of place. She could have done so much better. The casting or the acting isn't the most perfect, just for this one specifically. No offence.

### 704 Plaything

实话实说，其实不太理解这一集，不过这集里的1990年代复古小游戏，很有怀旧感，于是包容地看下去了。况且第一人称讲故事的是12叔，从声音认出来的熟人，就算只冲着12叔的声线演技，也足够把这集看下去了。

不过从概念上确实感觉是很神秘的一集，机器人有独立意识是一种生命暂时是可以理解的概念，但是像素小人也有群体意识也是一种生命，就好像稍微有点太超过了。嗑药之后看见的音乐里蕴藏的宇宙的真理，很难通过纯粹的画面感来理解。于是有点难以共情。

不过还挺喜欢这种平静的讲故事的语调和叙事，很calming，12叔的声线也是听着很舒服。

也很惊喜tuckersoft这个彩蛋，正好也同时在重温《Bandersnatch》，一眼认出是同一个宇宙了。很喜欢这种剧集之间的相互致敬。

### 705 Eulogy

又是一个重情感和解谜超过科技设定的剧集，黑镜好像总是在这两极之间摇晃得厉害，又从来没有忽视过任何一极，在不同集之间也平衡得很好。

这集的设定相对比较简单，只是一个memory recovery story, a reconstruction technique to help you remember what happened behind some forgotten memory, help you remember the past。节奏很慢的回忆体叙事，feeling-centric, romance-centric, sad beautiful story。

慢慢reveal what happened in the past, what are the things he's been trying so hard to forget and now so desperately trying to remember. Almost expect another Black Mirror-style crime story, but no, this one is just a sad little romance story. A story where two lovers just miss each other out like fate. 这样的错过，长久的痛苦，长久的误解，迟到的真相，淡淡的安静的疼痛，和回忆里重新想起对方面容的舒慰，作为最后的一点宽慰。

It's a rare nice peaceful story. A break from all the intense plots.

注意到这集的音乐使用得非常恰到好处。因为女主的设定是大提琴家，他们参与了乐队。于是时不时掺进来一些符合场景的音乐，说的是帮助男主的记忆，顺便也烘托了每一段记忆的讲故事时的氛围。又是一个慢慢讲故事来展开的故事。节奏很舒服。

### 706 USS Callister: Into Infinity

感觉很少看见黑镜出现完全是过往剧集的后续，这个可能是第一次。上一次的USS Callister据了解得了不少奖项，于是也不怪他们试图复刻那种成功了。把这集放在这季作为季终集也很明显的看得出主创想要力推这集。但也毫不意外地感觉续集远不如之前那集优秀，just like most sequels, they just can't copy the success, can't surpass the original. But this one is still decent, 大概是可以算过及格线的okay程度。

可能在看之前重温一下之前那集效果会更好，看的时候其实不是很记得之前的设定了，勉强地边看边回忆。不是很意外地看见公司两位创始人的好坏阵营在这里互换了一下。毕竟如果保持一致也太predictable和无趣了。但这样的互换其实也很predictable。

还挺喜欢设定里刚刚开始整个游戏设计的Robert Daly只是一个nerdy little obsessive nerd，唯一的乐趣是创造新的星球和宇宙。其实已经是整个世界的创世神身份，只是自己暂时还没有意识到，只是一味投身于创造之中，乐此不疲，但是孤独。而一旦意识到了自己的神的身份，意识到了自己可以做什么，power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, he turns evil immediately, just like his real self did. No one with that much power can stay good. Not unless they're saint.

左右两个碟片，一个可以救自己，一个可以救队友，非常明显复刻致敬黑客帝国红蓝药片了。到最后红蓝叠加变成同时解决两个矛盾的紫色碟片，a rare happy ending, a decent overall ending for the story.

Overall可以给个及格分吧。
