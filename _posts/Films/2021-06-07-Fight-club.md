It's brilliant. 

It's amazing.

Oh God, it's f\*\*king amazing.

I lost my words. I love it so damn deep.

It's really the most genius thing I've ever seen. 

David Fincher, is THE genius.

This is what should be called as an art. Real art.

This is what movies should be like, what art should do: hit me, hit me hard on the face, wake me up, push me to live the life, really live the life.

> “What will you feel if you die right now, right this moment?”

I will feel... nothing. I feel wasted, as if I never lived before.

Is this pathetic life the life I wished for?

No, it's not. But it is surely pathetic.

Wake up, stop feeling miserable about yourself. Stop feeling sorry, feeling pitiful, feeling so damn blue and down.

You are more, you are a lot more than that. You deserve to live, to feel the anger, to express the anger, and that desire to destroy.

Stop feeling fearful, feeling terrified, worried, anxious, about losing something you already have.

Don't be tied up by what you already have.

> “Only those who have no fear are free.”

You want freedom? Let things go. 

Lose everything, set loose of them, let them go, that's the only way you can get free.

> “If you don't become the person you want to be in six weeks, I will come back and kill you.”

A life that you are not really living, is a life that is not worth living.

Kill yourself, so you can reborn.

Six weeks. It's all the time that it needs.
