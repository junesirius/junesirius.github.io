最精彩也最难过的部分要来了。

> 在我爬上阳台后，我会对你说“我救了你之后会发生什么？”然后你回答“我也会把你救回来。”

相互救赎。

> 你觉得，有多少个我们正这样躺着？
> 
> 无穷多个（Infinite）。
> 
> 在无限的时间里（In infinite time）。

> You know, the only way to have something for infinity, is by losing it.

唯一能永远拥有什么的方法，是失去它。

哭到说不出话来。

You're not alone.

<br>

> “Is there anything I can do for him?”
> 
> No, not really. You just need to be there for him.
> 
> And when everything seems hopeless, you just take one day at a time.
> 
> And if one day becomes too much, then just take one hour at a time.
> 
> And if one hour becomes too much, then just take one minute at a time.

One day at a time.

That's what I would say to myself every morning.

<br>

> \- I just know that this isn't going to work out.
> 
> \- Why do you say that?
> 
> \- Because it's true. I'm just going to hurt you. And then you'll hate me.
> 
> \- No, you don't know shit about how this is going to end. We might get a nuclear bomb dropped on our heads tomorrow, and then dicussing this now is just a waste of time, so I suggest that you just stop talking about the future.
> 
> Let's play a game. It goes like this, it's called 'Isak and Even: Minute by minute.' It's about, the only thing we have to worry about, is the next minute.
> 
> \- What should we do at this minute then?
> 
> \- This minute we'll kiss.

这一分钟，我们亲吻。

突然觉得，现实里的Eva和Chris不会在一起了吧，这俩人看上去好配，动作也很亲昵的样子。
