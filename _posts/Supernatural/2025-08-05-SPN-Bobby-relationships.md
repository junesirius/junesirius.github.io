just saying,

Bobby had a thing with Jody (that Leviathan said he wished to have a life with her once this is over), which seemed mutual

Jody had a thing with Crowley (had a date with him)

Crowley had a thing with Bobby (couldn't help taking photo and tongue kissing him)

=> There's your love triangle of the day

<br>

And,

Bobby had a thing with Ellen (could marry her in Titantic AU and Zachariah's This is a terrible life AU)

Ellen doesn't like John (strongly, for what he did to her and Jo)

Bobby doesn't like John (strongly, for what he did to Dean and Sam)

=> Guess those who could have been together are indeed very aligned in likes and feelings

=> Really want to see the world Bobby and Ellen bring Jo, Dean, and Sam up T_T

<br>

(Why suddenly think about Bobby's could-be relationships: was suddenly writing a canon divergent scene where Ellen met Jody, and my magic brain realizes... both of them could have been Bobby's other half... But in the end Bobby never had either of them. All he had till the end were the Winchester boys.)
