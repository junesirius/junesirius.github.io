Jensen is looking at his phone with a serene frown when Misha walks into the green room. Misha was walking toward the desk where his own phone lay face down, but seeing Jensen's glued attention on his screen, he walks toward him instead.

"Everything alright?" Misha asks in concern.

Jensen almost jumps. "Jeez, wear a bell!" His fingers turn off the phone screen automatically. "Of course," he answers too quickly, not suspicious at all. "Why wouldn't it be?"

His gaze slides away, shifting as if it doesn't have a target but unmistakably lands on Misha's untouched phone on the desk.

Misha studies his look, head tilted ever so slightly -- the adorable move he must have picked up from ten years of playing Castiel. He raises his eyebrows, but says nothing.

"Alright." He walks back to the desk, and picks up his phone.

"Don't open Twitter," Jensen blurts out hurriedly, then immediately looks regretting the words.

Misha gives him a quick amused look.

And of course Twitter is the first thing he clicks open.

There they are, on the trend, their names side by side.

"Anything I said today?" Misha wonders if he should click on his own name first or Jensen's, his finger hovering over the screen.

"Nah, some old shit," Jensen pulls a resigned face. "Like, years and years old, I don't even remember. Man, I tell you, people on the internet are weird."

That is when Misha's own voice echoes from his phone, playing on a ten-second loop: "*Yeah you sassy bitch, you like it?*"

"Dude!" Jensen wipes his face with both hands, speaking slowly, one word at a time, "Why are you playing it out loud?"

Misha turns his phone around so the looped clip of the five-year-younger version of him straddling the blushing man on the stage floor is right in Jensen's face. His eyes sparkle with amused mischief. "Because you like it?"

Jensen shifts uncomfortably in the chair, one hand pressing the heel of his palm to his forehead, the other reaching down to the edge of the shirt, tugging it vainly. "I hate you," he says, defeated.

Misha takes the mere two steps left between them and stands right in front of him. His eyes glance cheekily downward, clocking in the accident that is apparently, inevitably replaying itself. "No, you don't. You love me too much."

Jensen finally looks up at the man standing before him, his face falling soft, his eyes locked on the familiar, beautiful, ocean-blue eyes. He sighs. "Damn right I am, come over here."

His hands reach for Misha's waist, clutching the blue sweater, dragging him close.

There is no more space for Misha to stand without falling onto Jensen completely. And the man's hands are still tight around him. Misha stumbles, having to sit in Jensen's lap before losing balance completely and toppling them both to the floor. The straddling position again. His own hardness starts to show under the tight jeans.

Misha wraps his arms around Jensen's shoulders, locking them behind his neck. Their lips are mere inches apart, and Jensen's eyes are drawn to them like a magnet.

"Careful, don't want to ruin the sweater. I like it," Misha fake complains. The warm, soft sweater is a little too thick for the April weather, but he has been refusing to change it ever since Rome.

Jensen's gaze moves up to meet his eyes again, drowning in the same shade of blue as the sweater. "I think I'm entitled to ruin it," the tips of his lips curl up. "Since I'm the one gifting it."

"I should give you something back," Misha says, leaning in slightly. Two inches away. Their shallow breaths brush light breeze on each other's face, melting into one.

"You already did. You are." Jensen closes the last remaining distance, pressing his lips to his angel's.

Misha tilts his head a little so their noses wouldn't bump, kissing back thirstily. His teeth tentatively close on Jensen's lower lip but don't quite bite. There is a tongue or two between their mouths, tangled together like snakes in mating.

They have to break to catch some breath after a while.

Jensen moves a hand to Misha's jaw, one finger tracing the line of his lips as if he's drawing them, eyes intent.

"I should get you some real lipsticks," Jensen smiles, voice slightly hoarse from the breathlessness. "Like the one I painted on your photo."

Misha makes a small, happy, humming sound. "I could get you some lip balms then. You know, just make it more edible."

"Edible?" Jensen barks a laugh, crinkles climbing onto the corners of his eyes. Misha's next kiss lands there, making him have to shut his eyes for a second.

"Yeah, like eating for dinner or something," Misha answers easily, pulling back just enough to sit up straighter. The hand that was holding his waist has slid down to his hip.

Jensen meets his eyes, brows raised in fond amusement, "Is that what I think... yep it's what I think it is. Dammit." The bulge in his jeans grows. He hisses at the strain, glancing back at the clock on the wall. And he curses again. "Dammit, but we don't have enough time."

Misha follows his eyes, sighing too. "What a shame."

But his face doesn't say the same. Instead, he shifts where he sits, moving in closer, until their hardness press together.

Jensen's breath hitches. He bites his teeth so no moan can leak out of his mouth. Misha lowers his head and kisses him on the lips again.

Jensen moves both his hands to Misha's hips, guiding his move.

They only pause nervously when there seems to be some sound of footsteps approaching the door.

Jensen whispers, "Did you lock the door?"

Misha gives him a look, and goes, "I'm a bit busy here, so no, I did not lock the door."

They hold their breath, waiting. The sound moves away and fades in distance.

They let the breath out, shallow and shaky.

Misha puts his hands on the back of the chair briefly, trying to straightening his upper body slightly, making the angle more comfortable. After all, the chair is a little cramped. His hips are in a strained position, especially where the metal implants are.

"Careful, you're fifty now." Jensen uses his hands to support him, adjusting the position with him, sliding down on the chair slightly.

Misha gives him a glare. "Why, people stop having sex at fifty?"

Jensen laughs hard, palms moving around the other man's ass. "Not us, apparently. Remember that song you played me that day? The one on the fan's phone?"

"That *'I want to have sex with Jensen Ackles'* song? Yeah, why? A little hard to forget, isn't it?" Misha lowers his body again, sitting almost right on top of Jensen's crotch. The grinding makes them both let out a long, satisfied sigh.

"My point exactly," Jensen manages to get some more rocking movement from the new position. Every time they grind together, there is a suppressed, quiet moan right on tip of their tongues.

"Yet you told them you're heterosexual." He purses his lips a bit.

"I also wear a rainbow shirt and tell them *'The carpet matched the drapes today'*," Misha protests. "And told them full penetration, twice."

Jensen can't help beaming at that. "Yes, you did. You just love exploding the internet, don't you?"

Misha nods with a big, wild smile. He leans in, lips hovering on the other man's earlobe, breathing heat there, speaking in a sudden lowered, grave voice, "You know what else I love to explode?"

Jensen shudders at the sudden deep voice. With one especially hard grind, his body slackens, letting out a long, breathy sigh. With one word melted in that sigh -- "Mish."

Misha grips a handful of the tightened muscle, closing his eyes at the same moment, collapsing onto the body beneath him. The happy, sated sensation explodes.

They ride the wave down slowly together, lips searching every patch of each other's exposed skin that happens to be nearby the lips and pressing kisses every which way.

They catch their breath at long last. And the first sentence Jensen says with his husky voice is: "We should do that properly again."

And Misha answers with a goosey, bright grin: "Tonight, seven, my place."

They've long forgotten about the straddlegate. Even as that word continues trending.

They have more things to do.
