**Summary:**

The man has been sitting there for ages, looking at the colored window facing south, not moving an inch, as if he has been there since the dawn of time. The afternoon sun shines through the window, casting a shade of blue on the marble floor. His eyes follow the color -- deep, weathered, and indescribably sad.

A kind, young student sits next to him, asking if he's okay.

The weathered man says, "Let me tell you a story. A story from four thousand years ago, about a man named Dean, and a color of blue."

The man has been sitting there for ages, looking at the colored window facing south, not moving an inch, as if he had been there since the dawn of time. The afternoon sun shines through the window, casting a shade of blue on the marble floor. His eyes follow the color -- deep, weathered, and indescribably sad.

Every campus has legends of its own, and rumor says the colored glass window in the south campus facing the lake is thousands of years old, and the man guarding it is even older. Young art students pass through the corridors, walking past the man as if he were not there. He doesn't look like a part of the place, but almost like a part of the building itself -- a part of the wall and window. A statue.

A kind, young student sits next to him, asking if he's okay.

The weathered man says, "Let me tell you a story. A story from four thousand years ago, about a man named Dean, and a color of blue."

<br>

In 1500 BC, there was this man born in Mesopotamia, named Dean. He worked as a metalsmith. The furnace burned hot and melted metals; he swung hammers to break the hardest metals and shape them into weapons. Weapons that would be used for wars, for attacking, for defending. For violence.

He looked at the spears and shields created by his hands, thinking, the world should be more than that. More than violence. More than blood. More than things that were meant to kill and things created because people were scared. He looked at his hands, and decided, they should be used to create, not to destroy.

He went searching for colored stones and ores from mines, and he added them to the molten quartz in his furnace. Metals melted into liquid, and when they solidified, they turned into the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. The translucent glass shimmered with a gleam of blue, like sky, like sea, but so much more. He held his breath, raising the colored glass against the sun, admiring it.

It was the most beautiful color he had ever seen -- the world had ever seen. It shifted under the sun, swam within the solidified glass, like a living portrait in a painting, like a statue, so vivid yet so still. The blue was otherworldly, ethereal, sacred. Dean forgot to breathe, and believed he had a glimpse of Heaven just through it. Tears came down his face and dropped onto the colored glass.

He loved the color so much he carried it with him all the time. He held it in the pocket closest to his heart. He stared at it whenever he thought about it, and every time, that blue grasped his breath away with its beauty. It shimmered under the sun, gleamed with life. Dean thought, it must be alive, how else could it be so astonishingly beautiful? He thought, it must be an angel that he caught eyes on.

He called it the Angel of Blue.

It was the age before dawn, the age before Roman and Greece, the age when magic was not a legend and gods walked among mankind. And that was an age, when gods and angels were born from man's belief.

It must be how it happened, Dean thought. That was how the Angel of Blue emerged, from the colored glass, from the color itself, standing before him. Because he had stared at the color long and longing, because his tears had fallen on it, because he had held it close to his heart for days and nights.

The Angel of Blue came to life.

And he had the bluest eyes.

<br>

<br>

"Does he have a name? The Angel of Blue?" the young student asks.

The weathered man looks at the colored window, deep in thought. "I think he does," he answers dreamily, more sadness seeping out of his eyes. "I think he does, but it's a story from a long time ago now. Too long, and the name was lost."

"Dean would give him a name as beautiful as the color," the young student says gently.

The weathered man turns to him slightly, a small smile curling at the tip of his lips. "Yes, yes, he did! I remember now. That most beautiful name was *Castiel* -- he called him *Cas*."

<br>

For a lifetime, they spent together, Dean with his Angel of Blue, his muse of creation, in the age of dawn. They built together, they created together -- glass, metal, art, inventions, creations, wonders. They lived together. They breathed together.

For a hundred years, they walked the Earth side by side, traveling from one land to another. For a hundred years, Dean wondered if it had all been a dream. He kept the very first colored glass with him all his life, closest to his heart. His fingers would caress that astonishingly beautiful shade of blue whenever he thought of him and found him incredible, and Cas would hold his hands and tell him, "That was me. I am right here now."

A hundred years was long, for a Mesopotamian, for a human -- it was already so much longer than any other man he knew, but it still didn't feel long enough when he lay on the bed, aged and withered. Cas sat by his bed, holding his hands, looking just as young and beautiful as the first day he had appeared. The exact same shining blue eyes, the same messy black hair, the same face with a sharp jaw. The color of blue did not age, nor did he.

"I have no regret in my life but one," said Dean, old as he was, telling Cas with a sad, faint smile, "that I'll have to leave you alone now."

His breath thinned, but he struggled with the last thread of that breath to tell Cas how much joy and luck he had found in those hundred years because of him. "I was a lucky man to find you, and that you came to me." Dean smiled at him, gentle, loving. "Remember all the places we went together? All the glass and metal we created together? I wouldn't trade a single day for anything else."

"I love you," he told his angel, his blue, the love of his life. "I've told you for a hundred years and I will say it one last time. Goodbye, my love."

"No --" Cas knelt before his bed, holding his hands. Tears fell from his face, just like the tears that had fallen from Dean's the first time he saw the color of blue that was Cas.

"I could not watch you die," he cried. "I was not even human, but you gave me life. So now, I'm giving this life back."

He took out that beautiful little piece of glass Dean had always held dearly to his heart, and touched it with a sad, but happy smile. "So you can continue to live now."

He started fading, like a fairy going back to the flower that had conjured him. He was going back to be just a streak of blue, a color on a glass, the true form he had come from before he had life, the life Dean gave him. He still looked at Dean with those breathtakingly beautiful, bluest eyes as he faded. "Goodbye, Dean."

Age left Dean. Time on him reversed like a clock winding backward, as Cas faded. He sat up on his deathbed, holding Cas's hands with more tears streaming down. "No, Cas --" he cried. "Why are you doing this? Will I ever see you again?"

With the last flicker of strength as a human, Cas smiled at him. "You will, Dean. You gave me life once, you can create me again. Remember me, and I will come back."

With that, he faded entirely.

The colored glass now had an extra streak of blue with more bright and shimmering life in it.

Dean thought, he could still see Cas's smile from just the color, just like looking into his eyes.

He kissed the blue gently and promised him in a whisper, "I will remember you."

<br>

<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">
<br>

"Did he remember?" the young student asks. "Did Cas come back, like he promised?"

The weathered man walks to the big colored window before them, touching long streaks of blue patterns inlaid in the mosaic. "Not at first," he says, looking through the color. "For two hundred years, Dean lived alone, never aged a day, never forgot his Angel of Blue. But he was afraid he might, and he knew, if he did, Cas would never come to life again. The thought of never seeing him again troubled him tremendously."

"But the blue on the glass, he would always remember when he looked at that blue, wouldn't he?" the young student asks him softly, following his gaze.

The weathered man turns to him slightly. "Yes," he smiles a little, thinking. "The blue on the glass, it's so much more than a color, do you know that?"

The smile makes his eyes younger -- the weathered man is not old, he has a young man's face, elegantly carved like a Greek statue, but it's the eyes that give away the time he must have seen. And now, they are brightening up, as he watches the colored glass closely.

His finger traces the pattern. "It's a letter, a notebook. It has everything that needs to be remembered, if you know how to read it."

He glances at the young student. "You have lovely blue eyes, too, just like him."

The young student smiles warmly, nodding at the window. "What does it say?"

<br>

Dean continued to live as a young man. He painted every shade of blue that he saw on his way, on every kind of material. He added different stones to the furnace, and created new things from them.

He came back to Mesopotamia, but he didn't stay long. It had become a new land to him, just like all the other lands, with no one he knew. He travelled to Babylon, to Egypt, as far as India, even China.

He journeyed across the world, always carrying that small piece of colored glass with him. He would stare at it, press his lips on the two streaks of blue on it. People thought him strange, mad even, because he looked at it as if it were the love of his life. They laughed at him. Dean never argued.

And he never aged. He thought it must be because the life was shared by Cas, and Cas did not age.

He never had a companion for his travels -- his wandering and drifting, really, for he didn't have a home to return to -- he didn't think he needed one. He was only waiting for someone to come back.

In 1200 BC, by the Red Sea in Egypt, Dean saw the bluest water he had ever seen, and painted it. "I wish you could see this, Cas," he spoke to the water and the waves, dangling his feet above the shore. "It's so beautiful, it reminds me of you. But I know, if you *were* here, it would look as pale as a cloud in a rainy sky."

The colored glass against his chest warmed, and a voice rose behind him: "I'm here now."

Cas reemerged, just as he remembered. The blue eyes, the black hair, the little lopsided curl of his lips -- nothing had changed since the last time he saw him.

Dean grabbed him and held him for a long time, burying his face in Cas's shoulder. "I missed you," he told him. "I waited so long."

Cas held him tight, leaning his cheek against his. "I missed you too, Dean," he said, voice quiet, almost sound sobbing.

For another hundred years, they lived together, travelling the world together. The clock of life started ticking for Dean again, because with Cas, he started truly living the life.

The world was different from the last time they were there. They went to places they had seen, and places they hadn't. It didn't matter where they went, Dean thought, happy. Even if everything was the same, even if every day was the same -- with Cas, it didn't matter, he was content.

By the end of another hundred years, Dean was too aged to move another step. They sat together on the riverbank of the Red Sea, Dean's eyes were slowly closing.

"It's so good to see you again, Cas," Dean told his Angel of Blue, the love of his life. "But now, I have to go. I've already had twice the life of anyone and more, I was a lucky man. My only regret is I can't stay longer for you, for I am only a mortal, and your true form is so much more eternal."

Cas leaned on him, resting his lips on Dean's cheek, tears falling. "I will not watch you die, Dean. My true form is nothing but a streak of color. It was you who gave me life and showed me the world has so much to see. That life holds so much more. I have to give that life back to you now. I have to save you."

Dean sobbed, for he knew what was coming. He hugged Cas like his life depended on it. "I will wait for you again," he told him.

Cas wiped his tears away with his fingertips. "It's not a farewell," he comforted him softly, with a teary smile of his own, and said the same. "I will wait for you again."

As Cas faded, Dean turned from an old man to a young one, and the colored glass he carried, added a new streak of bright blue. As blue as the Red Sea before him, reminding him of everything the past hundred years they had spent together.

That was how their story unfolded, as the wheel of history turned, and they walked alongside it. Together when they could.

For three lifetimes, they travelled the Earth before the Common Era. The lands were wild and free, and they saw the rise of the bluest architecture,  made of glazed bricks, the Ishtar Gate of Babylon.

They met in Rome again, in 1 AD. Venice had the bluest sky, and they witnessed the lively cities of the Roman Empire in all their brilliance.

Three times in the dark age of the Medieval world, they reunited and witnessed the crusades launched by people with the bluest beliefs.

They listened to the bluest music in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in France, in the Gothic age of the 1200s.

By the time of the Renaissance, they went to hear the bluest poetry in Italy, when Petrarch composed *Sonnets to Laura*.

They read the bluest story together in the 1800s from a brilliant, lonely girl of the Brontë family, the story of *Wuthering Heights*.

And that was the last time Dean had seen him.

<br>

The weathered man tells the story as he points at the colors on the glass window.

"Dean made that piece of colored glass larger," he tells the young student, "so there would be more space for Cas to return to."

He chuckles a little, thoughtful. "It's like making him a bigger room to stay in before he comes back to life again. A bigger house."

The young student smiles with him. "I'm sure he appreciated that."

The man tilts his head, looking back at the glass. The afternoon sun is setting slowly, and the brightened pattern is stained with warm orange color. But the blue lines on there are still vigorously shimmering with the color of sea and sky -- the color of time and space, of joy and sadness. Winter frost on the other side of the window coats it with icy crystals, making the color even more ethereal than it already is. There are thirteen long and short streaks of blue -- thirteen times they've met and lived, thirteen times they've loved and parted.

"I never knew color could be a language," the man says slowly, "or that it could have a life of its own. Maybe I did, and I forgot."

He lowers his head, eyes resting on the lowest streak of blue, the one that has the darkest shade. When he raises his head again, there are glimmers of tears in his eyes. He asks, aching, "What if I'm forgetting things? I feel old every time I am alone, but I can't remember how old. I feel like I've forgotten so much -- even my own name, sometimes. All I remember is that story. All I know I can't forget is that story. What should I do if I've forgotten some really important things?"

The young student places a hand on his shoulder, rubbing gently, soothingly. "Why don't you look at the glass then? It's like a memoir, isn't it? Maybe just read a little more, and you might remember."

The man sits back in the chair before the colored glass, reading it like a book, a diary, a long journal, a love letter. The other man sits next to him, watching him patiently.

"Do you remember now? Who are you?" he asks softly.

"Yes," the weathered man blinks rapidly, breathing out, drops of tears tangled in his eyelashes. "I'm Dean. I'm the one from the story I thought belonged to someone else."

His young companion smiles encouragingly.

"And I think, after all this time, I've finally found out the pattern in the times Cas came to me," Dean says, contemplative.

"What is it?"

"When something is so blue that I could never hold it back anymore, it stirs in me, consumes me; when I miss him so much it's going to kill me, eat me alive; when the life force is about to leave me, that's when he comes to life, to save me, to bring *me* to life again." Dean huffs quietly with realization, the drop of tear sliding from the corner of his eye. "He comes to me when I need him the most. Oh god, I miss him so much."

He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand.

"Then what is so blue this time?" his young listener asks.

"Me," Dean replies reflexively, finding the answer right on the tip of his tongue before he knew it.

And the winter.

It's the bluest winter. He tells him his loneliness, his detachment, his alienation. He doesn't belong to this time and place, or any time and any place. He's homesick, and he's cold. They are on a land so far from the land he was born. He misses the sun and wind of Mesopotamia, but he can never go back again, for it's never the same as four thousand years ago. He thinks of Cas so much, because he's the only one who knows him, who would understand. Cas is the only one who he can feel at home, when home is long gone. He thinks of Cas every living second with every inhale and exhale of his breath, until his chest aches with the pining.

Several students walk past the corridor where they sit, schoolbags on their backs, chatting with friends, casting curious glances at the two of them. They hurry on with a fast pace, forgetting them the moment they pass, as if they are nothing more than a tree by the path, a window in the wall, a statue on campus.

Dean's eyes linger on the tiles they stepped on, then wander back to the quiet listener sitting beside him. He realizes he doesn't have a schoolbag, nor is he wearing a school uniform. He doesn't know why he assumed he was just another student of the campus -- they don't usually stop and sit down with strangers, and spend hours listening to their long and old stories.

"It's been almost another three hundred years," Dean whispers, devastated. "I miss him so much, but I can barely remember his face. Only the color of his eyes. I'm afraid I wouldn't even recognize him, even if he stood right before me."

His voice trembles, then, when he asks, "Who are you?"

The man sitting next to him reaches out and takes his hands, pressing a gentle kiss on the back of them where the wetness from the tear remains. Their eyes lock, and a small smile emerges.

Cas looks at him, with those blue, blue eyes: "Hello, Dean."
