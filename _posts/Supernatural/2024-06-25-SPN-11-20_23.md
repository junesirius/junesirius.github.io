> Metatron: No, no. I am saying the chapter *Chuckles* is devouring pounds of pages at the expense of... juicier stuff. Stuff that people might actually want to read.
>
> Chuck: Like what?
>
> Metatron: Well, like, uh... (turns around and picks up the manuscript) ...like the archangels. I mean, you have got maybe two paragraphs on them in here.
>
> Chuck starts to strum more notes on the guitar.
>
> Metatron: And that's it! Don't you think they deserve a few extra words. Especially your favorite, – Lucifer.
>
> Chuck: (stops playing the guitar again) <u>He wasn't my favorite.</u>
>
> Metatron: Oh. He helped you defeat Amara. You trusted him with the Mark. And when you asked him to bow to mankind --
>
> Chuck: He refused.
>
> Metatron: He rebelled! And in doing so, kinda wrecked Christmas.
>
> Chuck: Okay, all that's in there, except the – the bit about Christmas.
>
> Metatron: If you say that Amara is off limits, fine. But you know every great hero is defined by his or her villain.
>
> Chuck: (sadly) Lucifer was not a villain. He – He – He's... H-He wasn't a villain.
>
> Metatron: (looks at the manuscript) Okay. Real talk. Th-This is still a safe place, right?
>
> Chuck: Safest place ever created.
>
> Metatron: Okay. There are two types of memoir. One is honest... The other, not so much. Truth and fairy tale. Now, do you want to write *Life* by Keith Richards? Or do you want to write *Wouldn't It Be Nice* by Brian Wilson?
>
> Chuck: I want to tell the truth.
>
> Metatron: Then you've got some work to do. There are no revelations in this book! And that's weird, given who you are. There's no new information, no soul-bearing.
>
> Chuck: <u>That's because I don't have a soul.</u>
>
> Metatron: Right! But you invented them. *You* *invented* souls. *Souls*! Try shining a light on that. How did that make you feel?
>
> Chuck: Nauseous.
>
> Metatron: (annoyed) Oh. (groans) You know what?! No. That is not G-O-D talking. That's Chuck talking. And I get it – when you were on Earth, you had to go full method. Well, it's time for you to get back into character.
>
> Chuck: This is me.
>
> Metatron: Really? This – (holds up the manuscript and flips the pages) <u>This pile of self-doubt and nebbishness flooded the Earth?</u>
>
> Chuck crosses his arms.
>
> Metatron: Followed up Sodum with a blockbuster Gomorrah? Created as much as he punished? No! Unh-unh! The guy I worked for – total badass! And yes, he could be a dick. Now, *that* guy... had some stories to tell. And he has a lot to answer for.

> Amara: I've missed you, Dean. It's been a while since we've spoken. I'm aware my brother has surfaced. If you should cross paths, if he should reach out to you, he should know this – Lucifer, his favorite, isn't doing so well. <u>(Casifer appears, tortured and beaten) To say nothing of the vessel, your friend Castiel.</u> By choosing to ignore me, my brother is allowing this to happen. These and... other things. I thought you should know. (She fades away)

> A seemingly calmer LUCIFER strolls through the room with a book, flipping pages with studied nonchalance.
>
> LUCIFER: (to Chuck, without looking up) So where were you?
>
> CHUCK: That’s a... long story. How do you feel? I healed you.
>
> LUCIFER: Mm. Yeah. <u>Didn’t ask you to.</u>
>
> CHUCK: Son, be reasonable.
>
> LUCIFER: <u>One cosmic Band-Aid on my knee and what, you think we’re, we’re even now? (he looks up) Is it time for us to go play catch in the yard?</u>
>
> The sound of a door opening.
>
> LUCIFER: (looks back to his book) Screw you.
>
> DEAN: (calls) Guys?
>
> SAM and DEAN enter through the front door, upstairs.
>
> SAM: Hey, how’s it goin’ in here?
>
> They head down the stairs.
>
> CHUCK: (to Lucifer) Listen, I know I’ve been gone for awhile.
>
> SAM and DEAN put their bags down with quiet rustles and clinks.
>
> CHUCK: I’ve missed a few... million... birthdays --
>
> LUCIFER: Yeah, and the second your apes send a distress flare, boom. Daddy’s home.
>
> CHUCK: That’s not what happened.
>
> DEAN: Hey, these apes saved your ass.
>
> <u>LUCIFER scowls and snaps his fingers. SAM and DEAN look sick but quickly realize nothing happened.</u>
>
> CHUCK: (shakes his head) He can’t hurt you.
>
> LUCIFER: <u>Oh, so you’re controlling me now!</u>
>
> CHUCK: It’s just a safeguard.
>
> LUCIFER stares at CHUCK, incensed.
>
> SAM: Hey guys? Uh, Chuck? Lucifer... uh, Dean... Think we can try and focus here? Y’know, end of the world, common enemy, all that?
>
> LUCIFER: (slams the book shut, standing) Enemy of my enemy is my friend. (stands right in front of CHUCK) Team Amara. Go Amara.
>
> CHUCK: You don’t mean that.
>
> LUCIFER: You’re really not gonna say it.
>
> LUCIFER and CHUCK regard one another. Chuck blinks but doesn’t look away.
>
> SAM: He’s not gonna say what?
>
> LUCIFER: <u>(to CHUCK) Screw you. (to SAM and DEAN) Screw all of you.</u>
>
> <u>LUCIFER storms out between SAM and DEAN. When he’s left the room, CHUCK huffs and begins to leave as well.</u>
>
> CHUCK: (turning back to SAM and DEAN) Kids, huh?
>
> SAM and DEAN just gape and shake their heads.

> Loud, muffled rock music plays. Camera pans to another section of hallway to reveal SAM and DEAN standing in front of a closed door. <u>SAM bangs on it.</u>
>
> SAM: <u>(yelling) Lucifer! Y’know, sometime you’re gonna have to come out and... talk to... God.</u>
>
> There’s no answer. SAM throws up his hands.
>
> DEAN: It’s like the worst episode of Full House ever.
>
> The music stops.
>
> LUCIFER: <u>(yelling through door) If Dad has something to say to me, I’ll hear it from him! Until then, I’ll be in my room.</u>
>
> SAM: (abortively) It—
>
> Music resumes, louder.
>
> DEAN: (to LUCIFER) It’s not your room.
>
> SAM: It’s *my* room.
>
> SAM bangs a few more times. There’s no answer.
>
> DEAN: Whatever.
>
> They walk away.

> SAM, DEAN, and LUCIFER approach two chairs in the telescope room. CHUCK is already sitting in one. LUCIFER takes the other.
>
> SAM: <u>One of you is gonna have to, uh, go first. You know what? Lucifer, you agreed to have a sit down if God would show, so – (he gestures to CHUCK)</u>
>
> DEAN: <u>And Chuck, you did say you’d talk.</u>
>
> LUCIFER: <u>Him first. I’m the one who’s owed an explanation.</u>
>
> CHUCK lets out an aggravated little sigh but says nothing.
>
> DEAN: <u>Okay, let’s try ‘I feel’ statements. (to SAM) Doctor Phil.</u> (SAM shrugs) Eh?
>
> SAM: Ah, yeah. Of course.
>
> They go sit awkwardly on the steps to the telescope.
>
> CHUCK: (to LUCIFER) I am… sorry? that you feel that I betrayed you. That I acted without cause. (LUCIFER is shaking his head) I’m sorry that you can’t see you gave me no choice. (to SAM and DEAN) I’m good.
>
> LUCIFER: (to SAM and DEAN) You heard that, right?
>
> SAM: (to CHUCK) We all know that you are God, but maybe could you be a little less ‘Lordly’?
>
> CHUCK: But I am -- I am the Lord.
>
> LUCIFER: Wow. There he goes.
>
> CHUCK: I did what I had to do! To create the world, I had to lock Amara away. And when the Mark corrupted you, and I saw you posed a threat to humankind, I did the same with you.
>
> LUCIFER: No, you betrayed me. You gave me the Mark to lock her away, and when it changed me – when it did what the Mark inevitably does -- you threw me away.
>
> CHUCK: No, son. The Mark -- (he pauses) You always cast a jaundiced glance at humans. The Mark didn’t change you. It just made you more of what you already were.
>
> LUCIFER: <u>What I was, was your son. Your child.</u>
>
> CHUCK: Why should I put you first above all others?
>
> LUCIFER: (to SAM and DEAN) <u>You have any idea what it’s like to argue with your father when your father is God?</u> (to CHUCK) Everything is a tautology with you. Everything is, “Because I told you so.” Everything’s, “It *had* to be done.”
>
> DEAN: Pretty sure that’s all fathers.
>
> SAM clears his throat in a warning. DEAN waves him off.
>
> LUCIFER: Okay, fine. (he sits up straighter) Big picture, as God. You did what you had to do. But little picture? You *sucked* at being a dad.
>
> CHUCK: Okay, maybe I didn’t handle everything perfectly. But tell me: could I have kept humankind safe with you on the board? (LUCIFER stares) I know about your little bid to replace me with the angels. Okay, ‘New God,’ what would you have done about you?
>
> LUCIFER: That is *not* the *point.*
>
> SAM: <u>I-I can’t believe I’m actually about to say this, but... um. Lucifer is right.</u>
>
> CHUCK turns to look at SAM.
>
> SAM: (continues) All he wants is an apology, and you’re too concerned about being right to give him one. But apologies aren’t always about being right. Sometimes they’re just about apologizing.
>
> DEAN: Yeah, and the great thing about apologies is you don’t even have to mean ‘em. Y’know, I lie and tell Sam I’m sorry all the time.
>
> SAM turns and levels a look at him.
>
> DEAN: (mutters to SAM): Sorry. (he brightens) See? That’s. Heh.
>
> CHUCK: Enough from the peanut gallery.
>
> He waves his hand. SAM and DEAN are deposited unceremoniously in two chairs, which turn out to be in the chess nook upstairs.
>
> Cut back to LUCIFER and CHUCK.
>
> CHUCK: What? What would you have done?
>
> LUCIFER: It doesn’t matter. You are my father and you forsook me.
>
> CHUCK: <u>I did. I was supposed to love all creation equally. I wasn’t supposed to have favorites. But you… You were mine. I gave you the Mark because I loved you the most, because I thought you were strong enough to bear it. And when I saw that I was wrong... When I watched my choice devour my most cherished son, I hated myself, and so I punished you. And I am so sorry.</u>
>
> Cut to SAM and DEAN rising in their chairs upstairs, walking to the railing as CHUCK and LUCIFER emerge from the room downstairs. <u>LUCIFER is grinning.</u>
>
> SAM: Hey.
>
> DEAN: So... are we good?
>
> <u>LUCIFER and CHUCK nod to one another, then to the Winchesters.</u>

<br>

> CROWLEY sits on his throne, drinking from a rocks glass.
>
> CROWLEY: Stealing my moves, Dean?
>
> After a moment, DEAN walks from behind a pillar.
>
> CROWLEY: Let me guess. You got Lucifer back in the fold. He snapped you here.
>
> DEAN: No, it wasn't Lucifer.
>
> CROWLEY shrugs, goes to take a sip, but DEAN takes the glass.
>
> DEAN: <u>Ah-ah-ah! It's time to sober up. You smell like a Dumpster outside the Liquor Barn.</u>
>
> CROWLEY: <u>What's this? Concern for me? I appreciate your attempts at bro-mantic rekindling.</u> But I think we both agree that ship has sailed.
>
> DEAN: That's not what this is about. We need your help.

> LUCIFER: And here I thought I had made real inroads with you guys.
>
> ANGEL #2: You thought wrong, Serpent.
>
> LUCIFER: Serpent.
>
> ANGEL #2: We loathe you. We'll always loathe you.
>
> LUCIFER: Welp, I came here to ask a good-faith favor of you folks, but as you are clearly less than kindly disposed, perhaps you'll, uh, lend an ear to my very own Jiminy Cricket. Hmm?
>
> CASTIEL: Hello, brothers. Sisters.
>
> ANGEL #1: Castiel?
>
> CASTIEL: It's me.
>
> ANGEL #2: Do you think we see any daylight between you and the Adversary?

> ANGEL #2: Let's hear it from Him.
>
> CASTIEL: In good time. Do I have your support?
>
> ANGEL #2: <u>I can't even look at you, Castiel. You befouled yourself with the Deceiver.</u>
>
> CASTIEL: You know, <u>every second that I've spent subordinating myself to Lucifer, it's been a torment. It's destroying me, it's burning through my vessel. But I would do it all over again, because through me, he and God, they will defeat the Darkness. That's my role in this fight.</u> It's God's fight. You can play a part in that fight too, if you join me.

>
> SAM: You lock me up where I can't hurt anyone and you throw away the key.
>
> DEAN: Sam, no.
>
> SAM: Dean, you told me you couldn't beat Amara, that it would have to be me. Well, this is it – me.

> SAM: (to DEAN, quietly) We talked about this. It's time to do the smart thing.
>
> DEAN: So, what am I supposed to do, just sit by and watch?
>
> SAM: No. We're both in this fight. <u>You're leading this army.</u>
>
> DEAN: Oh, <u>you mean babysitting the bad guys?</u>
>
> SAM huffs out a laugh.

> Castiel: I was just... so stupid.

> Castiel: Thank you.

> CAS: Dean.

> DEAN: Cass.

> <u>Cass approaches Dean and hugs him.</u>
>
> DEAN: (accepts the hug good-naturedly but then looks sad) Okay. Okay. All right.
>
> CAS: <u>I could go with you.</u>
>
> DEAN: No, no, no. No, I got to do this alone. <u>Listen, if -- when -- when this works, Sam -- he's gonna be a mess. So look out for him, okay? Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.</u>
>
> CAS: Of course.
>
> DEAN: <u>(places his hand on Cass’s shoulder) Thank you for everything.</u>
>
> Sam comes back to the group.
>
> DEAN: <u>Okay, look. I want a big funeral. All right? I'm talking epic. Okay? Open bar, choir, Sabbath cover band, and Gary Busey reading the eulogy.</u>
>
> SAM: Done.
>
> DEAN: <u>And for my ashes, I like it here. Yeah. You know, as far as eternal resting places go.</u>
>
> <u>Dean reaches into his pocket and takes out the keys to the Impala. He hesitates a moment, as if collecting himself and walks over to Sam. Sam is shaking his head with tears in his eyes.</u>
>
> DEAN: Come on. You know the drill. No chick-flick moments. Come on.
>
> Sam reaches to take the keys but pulls his hand back. He pauses a moment with his head down, clears his throat and then takes the keys.
>
> SAM: Yeah, you love chick flicks.
>
> DEAN: (chuckles) Yeah, you're right. I do. Come here.
>
> <u>Dean pulls Sam into a hug. Sam sniffles, pats Dean on the back then pulls away. He clears his throat to collect himself.</u>
>
> DEAN: Okay. Let's do this.
