I'm so ashamed, Castiel. For what I've been doing the whole night, thinking about you, imagining you in all kinds of forms and ways. You'll never imagine what human imagination can do. All the dirtiest, kinkest, sluttest ways it can go. All about you, all around you, all the things I can do to you, it's always you. Reading those stories, those rumors about you, half of me felt so bad about how far they would have gone to hurt you, to humiliate you, to see you in the most un-angelic way, the other half was excited, find unspeakable pleasure in the imagined images.

I confess to you, Castiel, I feel so ashamed, I don't know which half of me is the real me, the me that is in dominant. I see evil inside of me, but I also see love. Cass, my dearest dearest angel, I hate to see you hurt, injured, dying, messed-up, bleeding, or in pain, that much I do know. But more time than often, you're even more messed up than I am. But I still love you so profoundly, I can't even explain why.

You see, the funny thing is, you are not even my usual type. You are just too... kind, too good for me. See those of my crushes before you? The pirate that has been killing people and robbing around for two hundred years, the Sith that has killed the whole temple including all the younglings... My types are usually the bad guys, the evil sons of bitches, the smart-asses that think the whole world is theirs to fuck up with. Some are good-turned-evil, some are evil-turned-good, but all of them complicated, standing between white and black. But then, there is you, bright, saintly, with big white shiny wings and lightings, thinking of nothing but to save people, to help people, to save the world, to love every soul. Isn't it just weird that I would even fall for you? But truth is, it just happened. I can't explain why and can't drag my heart out of it. My mind is just all around you, all the time, non-stoppingly, achingly.

I watched and read and imagined about you for hours, buried my mind in the images of you, sunk myself in the simple primal joy, and then, all of a sudden, the great sadness and loneliness started to crawl in. I realize I'm kissing my fingers as if it's your lips, touching myself as if it's your fingers around my body. I close my eyes, so I can imagine as if you are around me, behind me, somewhere near by, so that I don't have to remember I'm just myself, alone, in a lonely empty house.

I'm even starting to feel grudge towards you, you know, Cass? If it's not because of you, if it's not because of all the love for you, how would I feel this lonely and painful again? Being reminded that there is no way in the whole world I can find any human remotely like you? Even remotely as cute, as gentle, as kind, as nerdy and funny, as caring, as you are? How could I bear this emptiness any farther?

They say the bad dreams are not the worst, the good dreams are worse. With all the sweet, sweaty, over-private dreams and imaginations with you in there, when I come back to reality knowing none of them would ever come true, how can you ask me to live this human life just the same as before?

They say love is agony, to love is to hurt, to feel full and to feel more incomplete. I see that now. But it's already too late to pull out.

So here is my confession, my dearest beloved Castiel, my angel, my love: I confess that I love you, love you too deeply that it's like the rose vine that cuts and twines into my heart and slowly gradually kills me. But as long as I get to continue to love you for as long as I can keep, this pain and loneliness is the price I'm willing to pay for as long as you can stay in my life.

So come to me, Castiel, come to my pray and confession. Hear me, answer me. Come to my dream. If I can't hold you in this world, at least allow me to hold you there, in the world inside of my brain when no one else sees. At least that much you can give me.
