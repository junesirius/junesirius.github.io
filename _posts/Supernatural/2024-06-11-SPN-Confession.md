I'm so ashamed, Castiel. For what I've been doing the whole night -- thinking about you, imagining you in all kinds of forms and ways and settings and shapes. You'll never have much idea of how far human imagination can go. All the dirtiest, kinkiest, sluttest ways it can rush towards. All about you, all around you, all the things I can do to you, for you, on you, in you, it's always you. The worlds and settings and universes are different, but in the center, there is always good old you. Reading those stories -- those made-up rumors -- about you, half of me felt so bad about how far they would have gone to hurt you, to humiliate you, to see you in the most un-angelic way, the other half was excited, ignited, found unspeakable pleasure in the wildest imagination.

I confess to you, Castiel, wishing for forgiveness for all the dirty thoughts I've ever had for you. I wouldn't dare to look you in the eyes if you showed up before me at this moment. I don't know which half of me is the real me, the me that is in dominance, the me that decides what I want to do. I see evil inside me, but I also see love. Cass, my dearest dearest angel, I hate to see you hurt, injured, dying, messed up, bleeding, or just slightly in pain. I care so deeply for you, that much I do know. Though more time than often, you're even more messed up than I am, you've done wrong much worse than any human capable. I still love you so profoundly regardless, I can't even explain why.

You see, the funny thing is, you are not even my usual type. You are just too... kind, too good for me. See those of my crushes before you? The pirate that has been killing people and robbing around for two hundred years, the Sith that has killed the whole temple including all the younglings... My types are usually the bad guys, the evil sons of bitches, the smart-asses that think the whole world is theirs to fuck up with. Some are good-turned-evil, some are evil-turned-good, but all of them are complicated, standing between white and black. But then, there is you, bright, saintly, with big white shiny wings and lighting, thinking of nothing but to save people, to help people, to save the world, to love every soul. Isn't it just weird that I would even fall for you? But the truth is, it just happened. I can't explain why and can't drag my heart out of it. My mind is just all around you, all the time, non-stoppingly, achingly.

I watched and read and imagined about you for hours, buried my mind in the images of you, sunk myself in the simple primal joy, ducking and ostriching from reality, and then, all of a sudden, a great wave of sadness and loneliness started to crawl in. I realize I'm kissing my fingers as if they're your lips, touching myself as if it's your fingers around my body. I close my eyes, so I can imagine as if you are around me, behind me, somewhere nearby, holding me with your invisible wings and warmth, so that I don't have to remember I'm just myself, alone, in a lonely empty house, in the lonely human-only universe, living my life without you.

I'm even starting to feel a grudge towards you, you know, Cass? I blame you for the hurt I'm feeling, it's all your fault. If it's not because of you, if it's not because of all the love for you, how would I feel that much lonely and painful again? Being reminded that there is no way in the whole world I can find any human remotely like you? Even just the slightest remotely as cute, gentle, kind, nerdy yet funny, caring, loyal, innocent, pure, hot, as you are? How could I bear this emptiness any more minute, yet have to live with it for the rest of my mortal life? Where are you, besides inside of my love-fulfilled-yet-love-thirsty heart?

They say the bad dreams are not the worst, the good dreams are worse. With all the sweet, sweaty, over-private dreams and imaginations with you in there, when I come back to reality knowing none of them would ever come true, how can you ask me to live this human life just the same as before?

They say love is agony, is poison, to love is to hurt, to feel full and to feel more incomplete. I see that now. But it's already too late for me to pull out.

So here is my confession, my dearest beloved Castiel, my angel, my love, listen carefully: I confess that my biggest crime, my sin, my mistake, is that I have fallen in love with you. I love you so deeply that it's like the rose vine that cuts and twines into my heart and slowly gradually kills me. But as long as I get to continue to love you for as long as I can keep, this pain and loneliness is the price I'm willing to pay for as long as you can stay in my life.

So come to me, Castiel, come to my prayer and confession. Hear me, answer me. Come to my dreams. If I can't hold you in this world, at least allow me to hold you there, in the world inside of my brain where no one else sees. At least that much you can give me.
