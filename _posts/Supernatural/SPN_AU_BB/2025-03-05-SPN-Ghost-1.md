"The place is good enough, close to the office, good view, but no compete with California of course," Dean talks on the phone, pacing in front of the large floor-to-ceiling window that has the view of a running river right down below. The penthouse view. "But at least the rent is decent -- not crazy, in this economy -- says a lot already."

"Not like you need to worry about the rent." Jo laughs on the other side of the line.

"Hey, money is money." Dean paces back to the kitchen, grabbing the bottle of Master Cleanse and drinking a gulp. The taste still makes him frown, but at lease it's good for health.

"Like all businessmen say."

"Yeah why am I not surprised, the whole industry says that -- hell, the whole world says that, that's how we make money, am I right?" He laughs into the phone.

"I wouldn't know." Jo's voice unimpressed. "Not like I'm going to be business major or anything."

"How's school? Everything okay there?" Dean's voice gets more straight now, dropping the teasing tone.

"Why, if I get bullied, you'd dash in here kicking their asses?"

"I might worry more about the other guy, you know, call the ambulance before you kill them or do something worse. But yeah, got to look out for my little sister."

Jo snorts a laugh. "Bye Dean. Oh and, mom and dad said congrats on your new job."

Dean raises his eyebrows. "There's no shame to congratulate me yourself, you know."

"Oh I know." Jo chuckles, hanging up the phone.

*What a pain in the ass.* Dean amuses, putting the phone back into the back pocket, walking back to the center of the living room.

The place was furnitured when he moved in, the sofa, the TV stand, the bed, all included and in good shape. And not the cheap stuff, he can tell.

He's actually impressed with everything and the view, the rent should at least go double or triple. He has asked the renting company about the reason why, but all he gets is a big vague "You find a good deal" as if they suddenly take an interest in the charity.

There is no such thing as free lunch in the business, and no one would let go of free money, so he did have suspicion. But after inspecting the place for three rounds, there is still no problem he can find, the building structure is compliant, the renting contract is legit, he even has his lawyer going through the lines and there is nothing suspicious. "Guess it really is a good deal then." His lawyer told him.

So he moved in. Not with many possessions, just a number of boxes with some clothes and books that can fit into his Prius. He's here, new job, new place, new life ahead. Fresh start.

Dean Smith feels good about the life.

<br>

*Probably it's just because it's the first night, in a new room, on a new bed.* Dean tells himself, trying the yoga breathing.

He's still turning and rolling over in the middle of the night, feeling uneasy.

He opens up eyes, staring at the ceiling. The alarm clock on the bedstand shows around two now. He only has another four hours before having to get up for the first day in office. He wouldn't want to be late for the first day.

The sleepiness is there, he can feel it, the head heavy from the usual biological clock, but something is disturbing his gut. The feeling of being watched by something unseen in the dark.

Dean widens his eyes, trying to scan the room. There is nothing there, of course. The quiet night. So quiet he thinks he can even imagine neighbor's light snoring.

He closes eyes, trying hard, again, to hypnotizing himself into sleep.

That's when he thinks he hears the dripping sound from the bathroom.

*What the hell? Please not the leaking problem in the first day.* Dean moans, dragging himself out of the bed, turning on the light in the bathroom.

It's as fresh clean as any new bathroom can be. No dirt on toilet lid, no stain in the bathtub. No leaking tap.

*Then where the hell is the dripping water sound coming from? Pipes inside the walls?*

Dean glances at the walls, can't see anything except just feeling some chillness seeping through his nightgowns, making his feet cold. The temperature is lower than he expects. He sees condensed moisture forming some wetness on the wall, a thin layer of frost. Guess April is still not a warm season then.

He gets back to the bed.

The sound of dripping water continues.

He manages to count them in place of counting sheep, and finally gets a few hours before the alarm goes off.

The morning is filled with yawns and he's only back online after the second cup of coffee.

Dean gets on his way to the office.

<br>

Seven to five isn't an easy schedule but Dean gets used to it. The room is already dark when he comes back. Dark, and empty, and quiet. Not like he's expecting a wife and a warm dinner waiting for him at home or anything.

He prepares his own dinner and finishes it in front of TV.

Dishes done, trashes taken out, he sits down with a book, and that's when he notices that prickling feeling is back, the feeling from last night that he almost already forget or would think of it as a dream. The feeling that he's not alone. The feeling of being watched, being observed, being analyzed. The feeling of a prey right before the predator jumps on them. The feeling of a sitting duck.

Dean shifts in his ergonomic office chair, trying to ignore the strange sensation. Two pages passed with no idea what he's reading, he has to put down the book and walks around the room, scouting.

He turns on all the light in the room, every corner bright and lit-up. He walks from one corner to another, inspecting the places where he already inspected during apartment tour. There is nothing there. And of course there is no *one* there.

Dean laughs at himself. "Since when did you become a paranoid?"

He turns off the lights, leaving only the one above his desk.

The lamp flickers, blinking and diming, on and off, on and off.

"Come on!" Dean glares at lamp, as if his gaze can make the light behave.

It does not.

He turns it off and back on. The light shakes worse. His eyes hurt from staring at the blinking light, it's giving him headache.

He just turns it off.

*I'll deal with it tomorrow.* Dean thinks, taking a mental note for tomorrow's to-do item.

Standing in the dark, that is when he starts hearing sounds again. Someone is crying, he thinks, like a kid or a young woman. The sound is quiet and distant, like last night's dripping water sound.

*Some neighbor might be watching some drama TV then.* Dean tells himself, forcing down the unreasonable thoughts that are slowly creeping up inside his head. Not liking how they sound like.

*I'm not crazy.* He thinks, hard. Just some electricity problem and neighbor's TV and pipes in the walls.

<br>

He can't sleep, again.

Of all the things, this is the one that annoys him the most.

He can live with a busted lamp among everything else, but this feeling of being watched, being noticed, being surrounded by the darkness not knowing what's in there, it's killing him.

Dean curses, and sits up, turning on the lamp on bedstand.

Somber orange light lights up the room, taking away the dark shadow. The feeling does not ease, and Dean can't close his eyes and can't fall asleep. He scratches his head, exhausted. It's killing him but he doesn't know what's killing him.

He leaves a wall lamp on in the living room when he lies back down again, trying very hard to ignore that corner of the mind that tells him he's being a crying baby afraid of the dark.

The night does not go by easily.

<br>

Dean snaps out of the dream in a gasp, his chest heavy with weight. His hands clenching the chest, panting. He already can't remember the dream, just the lingering feeling of the weight on the chest, the breathlessness, the sweat on his back still remind him of a rough night.

He checks the clock, it still has twenty minutes before his usual clock. He gets up anyway, showering away the sticky feeling.

The shower water is freezing cold, for quite a while. He has to wait there, shuddering, cursing. And eventually it turns up, leaving the whole bathroom steaming with the hot steam. The mirror covered by the steam.

Dean is wiping his hair, when he has a glance at the mirror. And that freezes him cold. The steam on the mirror has four capital letters, unmistakably read: "DEAD."

He flees out of his apartment as fast as he can.

<br>

*There is something in his apartment.* Dean is sure.

They tell him there is nothing wrong with his apartment, the maintenance guys, after checking the lamp, the electricity, the pipe, and the AC. They tell him everything working perfectly, temperature warm and cozy, lights bright and constant. They wish him a good night and leave.

Dean has to gather up enough courage to go back into this place that is his new home for merely two days and he is already thinking about moving out.

*Jo would never let it go and it will forever be her tease.* Dean grimaces, slumping down on the chair.

They tell him the mirror is clean, but it might be a previous prank someone draw on it, leaving slight trace of skin oil or something, that's why the words show up. They try heating up and steaming again, but no words this time. "Probably nothing." They say.

But "probably" is not the same as "exactly" or "absolutely", is it?

Dean still cannot sleep. And after the word on mirror, it's getting worse. He always has to leave a wall lamp on in the nights now. And he has to use some melatonin to help.

He stares at his own image in the mirror, seeing the bag under the eyes growing larger and deeper and darker. He asks, "What the hell is going on?" The reflection stares back at him, exhausted, no answer for him.

The water tap turns on by itself in front of him, steam covering the mirror from bottom up. The letters start writing themselves, one stroke at a time, by some floating invisible hands: D - E - A --

Dean yells in terror and runs out of the apartment.

He sleeps in the office that day. And the next.

<br>

"*Something* is in my apartment!" He can't stop himself from snapping at the person on the other side of the line, someone from the housing management.

"Mr. Smith, there is nothing in your apartment, we had undergone multiple rounds of thorough investigation, both before you moved in and upon request. The latest one was only two days ago." The operator answers, tone unchanging, not too different from a robot.

"I'm telling you, I can feel it! And apparently, with all those Death Notebook memo, I'm given an early warning notice, and I'm not gonna ignore it!" Dean rubs at his eyes, feeling the temples throbbing. The lack of sleep is tearing him apart atom by atom.

"You will still have to pay all the rent for the rest of the year as well as the deposit money. It is written under section twenty-six of the rent release, stating the situation where early termination is unavoidable." The robot tone tells him flatly. Too smooth.

Damn it. Yeah, he knows the clause. He frowned at it before signing, but it's kind of standard protocol.

"I could have been dead! Or might will be! The threating message is pretty straightforward." He tries again.

"The terms for death of tenant is covered in section thirty three. You will only need to give two months' written notice and continue the payment until then."

Dean snaps the phone shut, cursing.

<br>

He goes back to the apartment, eventually, before the week is over. *This is ridiculous,* he thinks to himself, *what he sees can't be real.* Keeping distance between the troublesome source, sometimes the situation would just look more optimistic by itself. Same for the calming time before quarreling couples go into divorce.

Dean's courage grows back.

He steps over the threshold. The door slams behind him, locked by itself.

All the lights in the room, whether it was on or off, connected or not, start frantically flickering. Blinking and flashing, dizzy and blinding, like the worst kind of club lighting.

The coffee machine and the blender turns on by themselves, motors and blades humming and running, spinning in vain.

He can hear the tabs turning on, water overflowing in the bathtub and sinks, flooding to the floor.

His desk printer starts printing automatically, eating blank papers and spitting ones with letters. At a glimpse, he can see it repeats the same message over and over -- "DEAD".

Dean jumps on his heels, turning around to try the door knobs, desperate. It holds still under his grip.

He shouts "Help" and pounds on the door -- no one comes to him. He reaches his phone for an emergency call -- the phone has no bar.

The temperature is dropping, his breath forms to white fog. He glances back, white smoke swirls and flutters in the center of the room, forming into some shape.

His throat already starts to get hoarse from the vain yelling for help, his hands and feet freezing cold.

Dean Smith thinks he is two seconds away from having a heart attack -- the kind that commonly known as: "scared to death".
