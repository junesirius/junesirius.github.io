"You got some nerve come here, Red." Lucifer looks out at the slim woman before him through Vince's eyes. He doesn't even bother getting the band members out of the green room -- not that he cared, or they care, really. "Just a groupie," he told them.

Rowena doesn't seem to mind that term either, or if she did, she doesn't show.

"Lucifer," she calls the Devil's name sweetly as if a lover -- she does play the role perfectly. She wears a bloody red long dress tonight, fitting her well.

"My Lord," she glances at him through her long upper eyelashes, blinking sheepishly. "If there is anything I can do for you, just ask --"

"You got any beauty spells locked up in that witchy brain of yours?" Lucifer touches the skin on Vince's face, turning to the lightened-up make-up mirror. Dead skin falls from where his fingers touch, leaving ashy traces. The vessel is degrading fast. "I got a big show tonight."

"Of course, do you want to cover that up or something more permanent? Making this vessel stronger, perhaps? Strong enough to hold you?" Rowena wanders behind him, eyeing the Devil and his reflection in the glass. She reaches for her handbag left on the green room couch.

"It does look good on me, don't you say?" Lucifer regards himself, lifting the chin to check the body he's in up and down. "Show me what you got, will you?"

Rowena has her back toward Lucifer now, glancing at her phone rapidly, typing quietly while stammering, "I-I-I'd help, I would, but I don't have the Book of the Damned with me. I lost it."

Lucifer tuts loudly, turning to her. "You know damned well where you put it. Did you see what I did there? 'Damned.' Besides, you don't need the book. Clever girl like you must have it all up here by now." He points at his head, then Rowena's.

Rowena sneaks the phone back into the handbag, taking a step back from Lucifer. "And if I refuse?"

Lucifer smiles wide and sweet, "Then I snap your neck again. Only this time, I'll rip your head clean off afterwards and burn your bones to ashes. We clear?"

Rowena curls her lips unhappily. "Yes, my Lord," she says obligingly, rummaging her handbag again to pull out a handful of herbs. "Shall we begin?"

<br>

So that is the scene they run into -- Rowena dipping her finger in some mixture of herbal water, painting on the bare chest of a man that is, to be honest, not that bad looking. The man was a little well-known rock star back in the day anyway -- he got the build and the look.

Crowley stands in the doorway, clearing his throat deliberately. "Is this a bad time, Mother? Shall I come back later?"

Rowena takes a loud exhale and immediately steps back. "About bloody time!"

She chants a short prose of Latin with lips flickering rapidly, ending with a fierce "FES... TI... NA!" Her eyes turn purple, while the pattern on Lucifer's chest burns into the skin like a branding.

Lucifer yells with surprise. Larger patches of skin fall from his body, decaying like an old tree's bark. He gasps in fury, "Red, what did you do?!"

Rowena pants heavily as she still holds out her hands toward Lucifer, "Sped up the decaying process, My Lord. You thought Keith Richards was bad? Try Iggy Pop!"

Lucifer growls, swooping toward her, "Decapitation is far too merciful for you, Ginger Bitch!"

Rowena raises her hands high in the sky, chanting even faster than before. Lucifer's steps stagger, falling to his knees to the floor.

"Mother, wait! There might be a small change in the plan," Crowley says by the door.

Rowena turns to him, with purple magic lights still bright in her pupils. Power of magic flies around her like a visible electric field. "Is that why you're taking so long, Fergus? Fraternizing with the Winchesters? Are you trying to turn against me, again?"

Lucifer starts laughing and pulling himself up from the ground, forcing Rowena to shift her attention back to him. The Devil's legs are still shaky, but his eyes glint with humorless laugh. "I see you brought quite some familiar faces. What's this, a friend reunion again? So soon? And all for me?"

He raises a palm suddenly and tears the door frame off. "You know I can feel you from a hundred yard away, Castiel. You think you guys can surprise me? Why don't you come out and play?" His pupils turn devilish red, staring at the door's direction as if they can literally breath out fire.

Dean and Sam rush to the poor civilians that are caught in the middle of a war zone -- the drummer and those other ones from the Ladyheart band -- right now hiding behind the sofa and in the wall corner, not having the faintest clue what's happening. They manage to get them out while the Devil's attention isn't on them.

Castiel steps toward Lucifer with his angel blade in hand. "We're not here to kill you," he tells the Devil, in a low and sincere voice.

"That's a pity," Lucifer laughs, "'Cause I am."

He waves a hand. Rowena is the first to get thrown out and crash onto the opposite wall.

Crowley tightens his jaw, charging forward, with an angel blade of his own, only to get thrown across the room like a fly blown away by a bat.

Castiel leaps forward, stabbing his angel blade into the man's bare back when Lucifer's attention was still on Crowley. Lucifer lets out an outrageous yell, grabbing Castiel by his neck, forcing him kneel on the floor, choking him while bashing him with ruthless punches.

"What's your plan again, exactly?" the Devil says, the red light in his eyes dimming, but his fists do not slow down or lessen the force. Cas's head is forced in an unnatural posture, lifting helplessly crooked up. His face is nothing but broken flesh and blood. Blue-white grace light starts showing in his open mouth and eyes, and the Devil's grasp is still tightening. "Thank you for not killing me, by the way." His voice is even turning into something gentle now. "Not that you can. But you know what? I have killed you before, like squashing an insect, I'll just have to do it again, properly this time. Dad is not here for you this time."

"NO --" Dean yells, dashing back into the room, throwing himself at Lucifer, without even a gun or blade in his hand.

Lucifer is surprised for a second, to say the least. Perhaps by his idiocy in the moment of heroism. Or perhaps just a moment of distraction.

In any case, that precious little second is all they ever really need.

Dean grabs the Devil's fist that hovers in the air, Castiel grasps the other that's still choking him, and the angel cuff clicks into place.

Lucifer struggles, but all the remnant of red lights in his eyes fade completely. The cuff clings with his moves but doesn't give way. "You gotta be kidding me." He stares at the two before him unbelievably, giving Cas another frustrated kick.

Dean gives the Devil a punch on the head, which finally knocks him out, shutting him up.

Sam and slowly-crawling-up Rowena and Crowley move toward Vince's unconscious body that has a trapped Devil inside. Dean leaves him to them, turning to Cas.

Cas is climbing up slowly, wiping the blood stain away from the corner of his lips. Dean lends him a hand.

He examines his wounded face carefully. Both Cas's eyes are swollen, black and blue all around, barely stay open. The split lips and gashes on the cheeks look terrible. The choking marks on his neck are the worst.

Dean swallows. "How bad is it? Can you heal?"

Cas blinks slowly. Thin grace lights up feebly in his eyes. Dean thinks the swollenness goes down a little bit, but it can also just be his wishful thinking. Not even the bleeding is stopped.

Dean watches him intently. "It's okay if you can't," he says gently, "we can always heal the slow way, you know."

Castiel just frowns deeper, closing his eyes, focusing. The bleeding stops, but only barely. The scabs form where the wounds are, as if he's trying to accelerate the healing process but still can't get it quite there. The circles around his eyes still look quite nasty.

*Exactly how bad was that extraction?* Dean can't help wondering, but he has to push it down. Otherwise he'd keep wondering just how bad *he* has hurt Cas and that would lead to endless sleepless nights.

"Alright, don't tire yourself out." Dean pats him carefully on the shoulder around the farthest edge, hoping that wouldn't cause Cas any extra pain. He forces his voice to sound cheerful. "Let's get home and patch you up the human way. I'm sure you'll back to full strength just in a beat."

Cas only gives him an apologetic, upset look.

Dean helps him up and moves to the car.

Sam and Crowley already finished squeezing an unconscious Vince-slash-Lucifer into the backseat.

"Why isn't him in the trunk?" Dean growls. Now he can't decide if he wants Cas in the front seat or back.

He leads Cas to the passenger side.

"What if he wakes up before we get there?" Sam asks reasonably.

"So? I don't give a rat's ass about how comfortable he is." Dean raises an eyebrow.

Sam sighs. "We still need his help. And he needs to be *willing* to help. The least we can do is not to piss him off more than he already is."

Cas chimes in just in time, not very helpfully, "That would be a very difficult thing to do." He meets the brothers' eyes, then adds, "Considering how angry he already was, and he would very much like to kill all of us as soon as he could. Just saying."

Dean forces a smile. "Good to know. Now can we go?"

Sam moves toward backseat door, while Crowley and Rowena are just about to walk away. Dean points at their backs: "Not so soon."

Crowley grumbles with grudge, "What?! Thought you got your reward already, I didn't even argue for a share. Still can't get a day off?"

Dean takes a breath to make the smile on his face looks slightly more genuine. Then tells them, "We might still need some more of your help."

Crowley snaps grumpily, "What am I, 911?"

Dean looks at Rowena, trying his best smile given the circumstance. Rowena rolls her eyes, limping with her high heels in her hand, and says tiredly, "What he said."

Sam helps out, "Once we're done with him, he's all yours. Revenge or anything, whatever you want."

Dean eyes him from the side, "We are?"

Rowena's lips curl up slightly. "Now we are talking."

Crowley's face also brightens a degree. "Look at you, Moose, you have the potential of being the next best salesman, you know that? I'll keep the position open for you."

"So we good? You coming to bunker together?" Dean raises his voice.

Crowley considers, then, "Not really in mood for slumber party right now, but call me. You know my number." Not waiting for Dean's answer, he turns to the witch, holding out a hand in an inviting gesture, "Mother, shall we?"

The two of them disappear in a black-purple smoke.

Dean blinks at the empty space.

Sam says, "Guess that's as good as we can ask for."

Dean decides he's right, shrugs once, and climbs into the car.

Cas already falls asleep on the passenger seat.

Dean turns the ignition quietly, and heads home.
