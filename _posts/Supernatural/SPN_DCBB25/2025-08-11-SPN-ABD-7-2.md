"What do you mean, kid?" Bobby asks. "*We*? We are a bunch of ghosts and many of you can't even touch a thing. What are you gonna do to fight against demons and a pissed-off archangel?"

The ghosts of old hunters and Roadhouse frequents are all on Charlie now. She glances at them nervously. "Just a thought, if it's body we need, I think there's a cemetery not far from here..."

"You want to be a haunted skeleton?" Bobby frowns.

Ash says, "That doesn't sound very cool."

Jo adds, "Almost like a zombie apocalypse. Except we are good zombies."

Charlie shakes her head quickly. "You're right, bad idea. Don't mind me."

Sam holds out a hand, redirecting their attention back to him. "Maybe not. Hear me out --"

They turn to him. Sam continues, "What if we split, half of you stay in bunker with Dean and Cas, don't let the demons come in --" just as he speaks, a loud pounding noise comes from the bunker's front door. The demons barricading out there are still relentlessly trying to break through the heavily sigil-protected door. They don't really know how long that door is going to hold. "-- Those who are interested to go for a field trip take a walk in the cemetery and we go to Hell together. Most of us are trained hunters, what's so different from fighting inside a fleshed body and fighting with skeletons? Keep away from iron and salt, close to holy oil and water, we should be fine."

"That's hell of a plan," Bobby breathes out sharply, looking around them. "But honestly I can't think of a better one. Anyone?"

The rest of the group falls quiet.

"Great, we do that then. I'll go with you, kid." Bobby volunteers.

"Count me in," Ellen says the same.

"Bobby, Ellen, you stay with Dean. Mary and I will go with Sam." A deep voice cuts them off from behind the group.

"John Winchester," Ellen turns to the newcomer, tone icy.

Bobby eyes him, expression guarded.

A quiet tension simmers in the air.

John avoids their eyes, looking directly at Sam. "Don't think I'm popular around here anyway."

"Damn right," Bobby answers coldly.

John shoots him a quick glance then turns back to Sam, managing a quick quirk of his lip, stepping closer. "What do you say? Your mother and I would love to run the mission with you. It's Hell, right? I've been to the place anyway, wouldn't get lost."

Dean keeps his eyes dedicated on Cas, his back to the doorway of his room where the others are gathering, but his Adam's Apple bobs up and down quickly. He has to snap his eyes shut to keep more tears from pouring out, but they're falling from the corners of his eyes nonetheless.

"Mom, Dad, it's dangerous out there." Sam says difficultly. "Maybe not everyone can make it."

"All the more reasons to come," Mary says gently.

Dean finds there isn't enough strength in him to voice anything. Any objection to the plan that can go wrong in so many ways. Any farewells to those who might never survive as a *soul*. Nothing but a whimper.

Sam's eyes are hot, but he nods appreciatively. "I never thought... " he pauses to manage the twitch of his face, torn between a sob and a smile. He looks at Mary and John with gleaming eyes. "I'd never imagine a day I'd go hunting with both my parents. I'd love that."

The perpetual pounding and scratching on the front door echoes louder and louder, passing through the corridors and reaching their ears. The bunker protection might be failing.

They glance at the noise's direction nervously.

"It's settled then," Bobby says resolutely. "Go. The rest of us will cover you and guard the place. And Dean, you can stay with Cas."

"I'll help with the bunker computer," Ash proposes. "Think I see some extra defense commands in the system."

Charlie pops to his side. "I'll help."

"I'll take the front door," Ellen says quickly. "Bobby, you take the back door. Jo, stay with Dean and Cas."

"I can fight, too!" Jo pouts reflexively.

Ellen gives her a look. "I need you sending us message if anything happened to them. Bunker is too big even for all of us."

"Which is a good thing in our case," Dean husks, slowly letting go of Cas's hands, standing up and turning back to everyone. They fall silent and listen to him. "The war room has the building construction, I can go over it with you. And everyone has one more advantage over demons -- you can walk through walls and floors, they can't. We'll need more holy water too --"

Pastor Jim raises his hand with his cross in it. "I got it."

"-- And the armory. We have big guns here, just need to move them into position."

Caleb and a few other old hunters raise their hands. "On it."

Dean's eyes land on the translucent figures around them, scanning their faces one by one. He breathes out heavily, and tells them wholeheartedly. "Thank you," he says more than gratefully. His eyes are burning hot with tears again but this time he blinks them away. "Thank you for fighting our war."

"It's everyone's war, Dean, not just yours." Bobby interrupts him roughly. "Don't ever think you're saving the world alone."

Dean pulls a shallow smile, then turns to grab Sam into a hug. "I'll see you around. Come back safely."

Sam nods over his shoulder. "Don't worry. I got Mom and Dad with me. Never felt safer."

Dean lets him go, wiping his eyes roughly, smiling bitterly at his parents. "Mom. Dad."

John and Mary give him a film nod. "Dean."

Everyone starts moving to their positions. Dean goes back to Cas's side.

It feels like a Deja Vu again, going to Hell, going to the Cage in the nowhere. Descending the stairs into nothingness, with a demon and a witch on his side. But the other companies are too different that Sam can feel their eyes on his back from time to time. Sam tries very hard to not glance at their current vessel.

"Well, that's a scene I never thought I'd seen." Crowley tuts loudly, eyeing the skeletons of John to Mary. The bones and skull of their current form shake and clatter as they make moves. The crispy sound echoes in the bleak passageway of Hell.

They still manage to pack and carry flagons of holy water and holy oil with them.

"Says by a demon," John retorts disapprovingly.

Sam is actually surprised that John hasn't topple the whole jar of holy water on Crowley. He wonders if it has anything to do when he last mentioned he's "a friend" back in the car outside Missouri's.

"Nor do I," Rowena agrees. "Haven't seen in my three hundred years of life. Haven't imagined with my wildest imagination, and you knew I can imagine many things."

"And a witch," Mary regards her.

"And you two are zombie ghosts. Be good ones before losing it, alright?" Crowley snaps his finger and lights the torches on the stone wall, continues leading the way down to the pit. "We already got enough problems."

Even him sounds exhausted. Sam observes.

Rowena is also surprisingly cooperative today, didn't even object much before agreeing to help. Sam points it out.

"What's the problem with you guys?" the witch rolls her eyes. "We don't do what you want, you're upset; we do what you want, you're upset. Make your mind, will ya?"

Sam rolls his eyes too. "Sorry! Just saying I'm surprised, that's all."

"You are just sadistic, I know. Poor Samuel," Rowena gives him an exaggerated smile, putting a hand on his shoulder squeezing intimately. Sam clears his throat loudly, shifting away, forcing himself not to look back at his parents.

"You boys just can't believe anything that's too easy to get -- a cake on a plate with a cherry on top. Your brother too." Rowena says brightly, taking her hand back, steadying the bag of ingredients she's carrying. "Though for his case, that cherry is an angel." Sam clears his throat loudly again.

They soon arrive at the level where the Cage is located. The deepest, lowest den.

The Cage hangs in the middle of nothingness, locked by iron chains wiring it around all its corners. The small confined prison where they used to temporarily talk to Lucifer -- which turned out to be not so temporarily -- still stands on the ground, which is the only reference to tell where the ground is in all the darkness and nothingness.

Rowena sets up her cauldron and the ingredients at the edge of where light still reaches, starts murmuring the spells. The runes and sigils carved on the side of the Cage brightens up in her command. A low rumbling sound like a distance thunder is rolling closer. More and more intense as the spell sinks in.

"Shouldn't we prepare him a vessel like the one you did for Lucifer?" Sam suddenly remembers, turning to Crowley.

"Sorry, one and only. Not exactly a vessel retail factory around here, in case you didn't notice." Crowley says dryly.

"He still has Adam, right?" Sam asks cautiously.

"If he hadn't broken his chew toy, sure." Crowley answers easily.

"Adam?" John asks in surprise. The skeleton's voice is raspy like sandpaper.

Sam swallows. Glancing back, he splutters, "Dean and I found out we had a half-brother a few years ago. Apparently he's also considered a Winchester by the archangels."

"A half-brother?" Mary asks confusedly. "What are you talking about?" She turns to her side, "John?"

Crowley whistles, "Awkward."

"I'll tell you everything later," John stutters, which Sam thinks he's never seen his Dad ever did before. "He's also my son."

Mary says slowly, "Okay."

John asks miserably, "How did he get involved in all this? I thought I protected him from this side of the life."

Sam lets out a short breath. "Not so much. Ghouls killed him and his mother, and archangels resurrected him as a vessel when Dean said 'No'."

"Oh God." John breathes heavily.

"He's stuck in the Cage with Michael for seven years now." Sam finishes.

"You couldn't save him?" Mary prompts.

"We tried," Sam tells them, feeling the bitterness on his tongue. "Death gave Dean a choice, saving me or saving Adam. He could only get one of us out, so he saved me."

John sighs loudly.

Rowena's chanting winds higher and faster, then halts abruptly. Their attention turns back to the ritual.

The witch slices her palms and claps them together, yelling the last pose: "*Torzul d, zamran!*"

The symbols on the Cage all lightens up at the same time, glowing together, combining into one, shining as bright as the Sun and more. The distant rumbling sound now becomes the thunder and lightening right on top of their heads. The heat and electricity in the air fries their skin.

"He'll kill us!" Sam suddenly realizes, yelling, covering his eyes. He vaguely hears the movement of others hurrying closer as well, something hard and rough colliding to his skin. But he can't open his eyes to see.

"Vaporize, not kill!" Rowena yells back.

"What's the difference?!" Sam counters automatically.

"Are you really spending your last breath bickering with this three-hundred-year-old bitch?!" Crowley shouts at both of them, ducking down somewhere. "We all going to die from your stupid plan anyway!"

And then, the blinding light recedes, a figure with the shadow of six massive wings descending slowly from the air.

Sam chances a glance. The figure wears Adam's body. But he doesn't want to think if that kid is still in there somewhere or butchered and tortured even worse than his soul once were.

"Michael," Sam speaks carefully, straightening up. He realizes John and Mary have thrown themselves onto him, covering his back as best as they could with their skeleton body. The soothing sense of security he felt a moment ago slides off him as they straighten up as well. Sam blinks.

"You wouldn't have been able to protect your son with your borrowed body, if I wanted to destroy every one of you," Michael announces solemnly.

Sam realizes he's talking to John and Mary directly.

John takes a step ahead, exposing himself to the light of the archangel without shaking. "I have to protect him as best as I can, just like I had been trying to protect you, Adam! I'm sorry I failed. I'm sorry about everything you're going through," he says loudly, looking at the archangel's lightened up face, the face that also belongs to Adam Milligan, or Adam Winchester, in his eyes.

Michael drops to the ground before them, bare-footed. The lights in his eyes extinguished completely, turning into Adam's bright blue eyes. He turns to John slowly, looking at him straight. "I'll let Adam decide if he'll forgive you. But before that, where can I get some decent burger or pizza? Adam is starving."

**Notes for the chapter:**

The spell Rowena used to open Cage: "*Torzul d, zamran!*" was referenced from the Enochian Lucifer used to rise Death. The Enochian can be roughly translated as: "Rise, show!"
