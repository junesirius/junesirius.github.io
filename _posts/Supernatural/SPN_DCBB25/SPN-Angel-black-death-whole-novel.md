## Draft

### destiel relationship arc

start with best friends, Dean "I need you" "family/brother", Cas already love Dean more than anything including the world

→ still keep the "love" to be just friendship/family love, not romantic love, still friend-family-brotherly love, but make Dean gradually realize what does that mean: no definition, but can be weighed, "everything has a price", Dean figures how much he would be willing to sacrifice to trade/sacrifice for Cas, just as much as his any other family member and more, so even if he doesn't admit, his action is already saying out loud: he is willing to sacrifice anything including Sam and his own life and the world for Cas (no need for verbal confession unless vibe feels right)



The ultimate question: how much are you willing to sacrifice for each other

Cas: willing to sacrifice himself and all angels and the world to save Dean

Dean: willing to sacrifice himself and Sam and the world to save Cas (and the world)

Cas thought Dean wouldn't choose Sam over him because he never did, Dean shows him wrong (but also because Sam is willing to sacrifice himself to save Cas and the world too)



Cas knows he loves Dean and willing to die for Dean from the beginning, and accept not loved back by Dean. He needs to know he's loved back, how much he matters to them.

Dean loves Cas and worries about him from the beginning, but he doesn't allow himself to think about it or admit it or define it, or really wholeheartedly love Cas and let himself be loved without scrupulosity. He's been hesitant to take the step. He needs to be able to allow himself to love Cas.

The key to save the world is to know they're loved by so many people, friends and family, accept them wholly as they are, and that they love them back, love the world enough so that they can save it.

The climax of this story is Cas will die if Dean doesn't admit to his love and allow himself to love Cas. He has to figure it all out at the end and open himself up.

### Outline

(Time: May 25, 2016)

(god POV + occasional character POV)

Angels are dying/going extinction because of ABD (caused by Darkness), Cas goes to investigate and tries to help/save angels, gets infested too. They find a vague lore about the purest/brightest light to be able to purify/save/cure angel disease. They thought it's Michael or Lucifer or the two of them together, take turn trying them out, getting them out of cage, asking for their help. Making them cooperate with each other, but Michael/Lucifer want to destroy the world together. Dean/Sam jump in to stop them, getting themselves killed and exploded, and the self-sacrifice explosion turn into the brightest light that cure the angels in Heaven. Cas goes to Heaven to get Dean/Sam back, but he's not cured yet. Dean personally uses his soul power (the brightest love) to cure Cas. All problems solved, HE.

In between the main plots, because the Heaven is crumbling down without angel guards, souls coming down to Earth, they get to meet with ghosts of people they lost in the past: the Novaks, the Winchesters, Jo/Ellen/Ash/Bobby, Charlie (like casual episodes in a SPN season) ~~→ move to Timestamps, because not directly related to the main storyline~~ → it may looks random and casual but actually important to the main plot because when they take back control from Michael/Lucifer, instead of using the Babe as a reminder of they have a home and loved by each other, they have all those friends and family there for them, know they're loved and cared and remembered and mattered to/by so many people, that's never a war of them against the world, they have all those people fighting with them.

### Outline curve

→get Lucifer

→help Lucifer recover (Lucifer suggest get Michael but they refuse)

→daily episode with ghost&demon(+surprise reunions+troubles)

→(Cas+situation get worse, Heaven can't wait longer) get Michael

→Dean/Sam say yes, kill each other, Heaven is saved

→Cas think they died, go to Heaven/vail to find them, let them decide if they want back

→TFW back together, Heaven on their command; thought problem solved, Cas is still dying

→Dean use his soul power heal Cas, soul-grace dance, Cas is saved

→TFW HE

### Setting

The Angel Black Death is caused by Amara/Darkness. Angels are essentially light, like God. Darkness almost killed God, so it's just as easy to kill angels, even when she's unintentional. "The mere touch of the Darkness is destructive."

Cas is also infected, but because A) the times he met Darkness face-to-face, he has Lucifer with him, his own body/existence is more or less protected by archangel (even if Lucifer isn't intentionally doing it), he's not infected back then → which is what they initially thought, but only partially right, the real reason is "he has warding light on him", but it's not Lucifer, it's Dean's love, he's loved and yearned by Dean, he's the only angel loved by another being like Dean loved him, so he's purified, protected by that love; B) when he goes back to Heaven to check up on infected angels, he goes with a very low amount grace, almost human, so only that portion of grace is infected. So his symptoms are slower and less deadly than other angels. But he still can't self-heal, and given time, it's still killing him. That's why his symptoms are only showing slowly.



Cas is infected but Cas's symptom is slow and nonlinear, especially slow when he's with Dean, noticeably worse when he's not. Because Dean is light, being with Dean is purifying him, slowing down the darkness spot spread, making him feel better altogether. So every time Dean stays close to him, cares for him, he's noticeably well, otherwise symptom would be immediately worse. (They didn't notice the pattern at first, but after a few times, Dean starts noticing, so do Cas and Sam. They still can't figure out/don't have time to figure out until after Heaven is mostly fixed and they come back down.) (That's also why Cas wasn't so sure about his own infection at first, because he thought he can heal as long as he stays close to Dean. But also worry it might pass to Dean as well, so he's trying to keep distance, which always makes so much worse. He's torn between wanting to be close to keep himself well and wanting to keep distance to keep Dean safe.)

### Claim

#### Claim Summary

When Amara invaded Heaven, angels were infected by darkness disease that is contagious and deadly, much like human's Black Death (so Dean names it "Angel Black Death"). All infected angels die painfully, the whole angel race is going extinct, Heaven crumbles.

Right after S11E23, TFW celebrate the victory after Amara/Chuck gone, then Cas notices ABD, goes to Heaven to investigate and unknowingly get himself infected. They find solution is to use "the Brightest Light" to purify the darkness. They think it might mean Michael or Lucifer. They get Lucifer back from LA music festival when he possesses Vince Vincente, fix his Nick vessel with Crowley's help, get Michael out of Cage with Rowena's help, try to talk them into saving angels but they want to destroy the world instead.

Dean and Sam say yes to Michael and Lucifer, and take over the control eventually, sacrifice each other to save the world and cure angels. Cas goes to Heaven to resurrect Dean and Sam, they only find out now Cas is also infected and dying. Dean realizes the real "Brightest Light" means love, he uses his soul and love to save Cas. Everyone saved, world in peace again. Happy ending.

#### Visual Elements

Lucifer is in rage, eyes red, shadow of his wings menacing. Cas spreads his broken wings to cover Dean, to protect him. Broken feathers falling down, his grace light is tainted with darkness, but he's still trying desperately to protect Dean.

Cas lies on the bunker bed, bloody and dying. Dark spots and sick symptoms are showing on his vessel and true form, darkness entangled with his grace light. Dean bends over him, caressing his face, looking at him lovingly. The light from his soul dances with Cas's grace, healing him.

### Editing Notes

~~Lucifer: "devilishly handsome face"~~

~~examine all "'cause", change some of them to "of course" or "because"~~

search "almost" and remove them

Re-organize chapter structures, most acts can be chapters, avoid too long chapters

Chap 3: Canon Vince's girlfriend Jen die from taking pills, OD to suicide, and Jen!Lucifer wear long bloody red dress

Chap 3 loose ends for later: Nick's wife/son are ghosts, can't move on, they promised to help her get peace when everything is done

~~Chap 4: where are Claire/Alex (S12E06) in Radiohead concert, Omaha~~

Chap 5 notes for later: John will meet Adam/Michael, and Mary will know, slightly awkward moments

#### Reference (Notes after work?)

It's a complete coincidence but as I write it and start getting writer's block, can't figure out where to take Dean/Cas relationship development, I realize the fic I'm reading -- I've been reading for the past month or two (it's an extremely slow read) -- [On the Wings of War](https://archiveofourown.org/works/245211) is THE most perfect reference and teacher to guide me. It's also heavily on the plot, it's canon divergent, it has so many different parties and the plot design is so heavy that it almost seems like destiel isn't in the focus of the story. And they start off as friends and brothers just like canon, and it's not exactly turning to romantic, just more of sacrifice for each other shenanigan. I'm dying to know how that story take their relationship to in the middle of writing somewhere around chapter 4. It gives me a lot of new inspirations and reminded me some of the old ideas I almost forgot (since the outline of the story started about eight months earlier than the writing).

#### Notes before/after work

Believe it or not, this story starts as a one-shot idea. Just a one-liner thought popped in my mind: "What would it be like when there is an outburst contagious disease infecting and killing angels like Black Death?" when the song I was listening to has a line says "I cry when angels deserve to die." I can immediately hear Cas say: "Do angels deserve to die? Do I?" And the story starts from there.

And then it very quickly gets stretched up -- the idea stretched itself up without me doing anything -- to a full-length story. I had to take out those very tempting mini-episode chapters and move them to timestamps to stop it from turning into a full-season-length S12 rewrite. I didn't see that coming either. But it's a fun journey.

Oh and, the other major thing I wanted to see really badly is that -- Cas would die if Dean doesn't open himself up, allow himself to love and be loved, admit to his feelings. I want to see him get forced to face the feeling that's called "love", because he never really learned how to do that or recognize that, even if he's already been doing that all his life. So it's a story of saving angels, and also a story of teaching Winchester what is love.

#### Act 1

> INT. bunker's kitchen - night (Cas, Dean, Sam)
>
> Celebration after S11E23 finale, thought the world is fixed, everything okay now

They're celebrating. Just the three of them in the bunker's kitchen, Sam, Dean, and Cas, with several dozens of beer and a full table of now-almost-empty pizza boxes. But nevertheless, it's a big celebration to their standard.

"Finally, finally!" Dean is saying, over a bottle of beer, can't stop beaming. "A big win long overdue, here we go!"

"Yeah I hear you," Sam agrees, a little over himself too, lazily leaning into the seat by the wall, sipping his share of beer. "No God, no Darkness, no angel or demon, no new freaking Apocalypse, no bigger disaster when the old one is barely missed. How long have we ever really get this much peace?"

Cas seriously considers his question. "At least eleven years ago," he answers with a straight face.

Dean looks up from his bottle, smiling even brighter. "Good to have you back, Cas."

Castiel meets his eyes and nods. "So are you, Dean. I'm very glad you're okay."

Dean studies his face, and Cas holds his stare -- it looks like they are just both silently researching each other, microscoping and dissecting, looking for the tiniest trace of something ominous hidden underneath that quiet and peaceful surface, looking at something they haven't seen in a long while, as if they didn't pretty much spend every second of the last couple hours together.

"How are you really, Cas?" Dean breaks first, voice soft. Judging by how Cas parts his lips and pauses, he is beaten by a millisecond by the very same question he was just about to ask Dean.

"I'm fine," Cas answers without really thinking, but his smile drops a tiny little bit, his voice mingled in a very quiet sigh. He shifts his eyes, turns to take a deep drink of whatever liquor that was sitting in the glass in front of him.

"No post-Devil-possession syndrome?" Dean chases his eyes. "Just, you know, when have things ever been easy for us? I'm just thinking loud, in case there is anything, we might want to give the celebration a rain check."

Cas stares back with slightly widened eyes, "No, there is no such syndrome, and I'm fine."

With that, he narrows his eyes and throws the question back. "What about you? No 'post-Darkness-entanglement-and-soul-bomb' syndrome?"

His fingers did an air quote, Dean's eyes drop on his fingers, flickering with amusement. He answers with a shrug and a small grin, "Nope, nothing, all peachy."

"Great! Uh, that is, great!" Sam chips in, looking at the watch on his wrist in a very deliberate motion. "Well, it's late, and it's been a hell of a day. Think I'll hit bed now."

Dean hums an acknowledgement, takes another drink slowly, then asks thoughtfully, "Don't you think, after the sun was gone and then came back, shouldn't the time be reset or something? Like, it's a new day or whatever? Hell, it's probably a whole new era when future historians look back. We got a BC/AD two thousand years ago, about time for another one. What should we call it? BD/AG, Before-Darkness and After-God era?"

Sam lets out a short chuckle. "Wow, Aristotle, I'll leave you to think about that." He stands up and pats his brother on the shoulder briefly, nods at Cas on his way out, and then disappears outside of the kitchen door.

Dean and Cas look in the direction where Sam took off, taking gulps of drink almost simultaneously, enjoying the comfortable lazy silence between them for a while longer.

"You know what this reminds me of?" Dean holds out a finger, vaguely gesturing the glasses of drinks between them -- or maybe it's gesturing the two of them, who knows -- looking expectantly at Cas.

Cas looks at him curiously. The sprout of a new grin is waiting at the tip of his tilting lip, suggesting another joke that Castiel knows he is likely not going to get. He asks anyway, "What?"

"Seven years ago, that brothel. You and me, drinking." Dean can't hold back his laugh any longer. The laughter creases the edge of his eyes. "I think that's the first time you actually drink, isn't it? Now look at you --"

As if on cue, Castiel finishes the glass in front of him in one long take. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand before answering, "I learned it from you."

"You learned from the best." Dean comments, satisfactorily, searching for more bottles that are not emptied on the desk.

They continue chatting. They talk and laugh. They share old funny stories. Dean doesn't consider himself nostalgia, usually, so this must be alcohol's fault that everything is getting dizzy and light-headed that he just wants to keep this moment longer. This moment when he knows everything is safe and sound, everyone he cares about are home and comfortable, Sammy in bed, just as if he is still an eight-year-old chubby kid that needs to go to bed by nine, and his best friend right by his side. A lingering rational mind is whispering to him that this might just be the postmortem affect of adrenaline rising too high and haven't come back to normal level yet. The other part of him only wants *this* longer -- his swimming brain can't really name properly what *this* is exactly, but the peace and quiet is just right and comfortable as it is, so he decides he likes it, indulges himself in *this* longer, wills *this* to last forever if he can, before anything else disrupts. So Dean reaches for the next drink, and keeps talking.

After god knows how long -- Dean loses sense of time long ago -- Cas finally tears himself away from his drinks and presses a palm on top of an open glass to prevent it from being raised to meet Dean's lips again.

"Dean," he says quietly but firmly, "I don't think it's wise to keep drinking more."

Dean shakes his head briefly to clear his mind, looks like as if a warm bubble around his head just get popped and he is trying to sink back to the seat from his floating state. "Guess you're right," he mummers sleepily, "as much as I'd like to stay, I'm probably too old for the overnight carnival and celebration now. Need to pass out for a couple hours." He stands up staggeringly, his eyes can barely stay open now, he'll own that to more tiredness than drunkenness.

"I understand." Cas stands up too, follows him out of the kitchen and helps Dean get back to his room before his crooked footsteps take any wrong turn.

"Get some rest, Dean." Cas says, his hands holding some of Dean's weight until making sure he's secure on his own bed. Then he gestures the other end of the corridor. "I'll just take the guest room."

"Good night, Cas," Dean mumbles, though Castiel suspects he might already fell in sleep before finishing the sentence.

Cas turns off the light, lingering by the door in the dark for two seconds too long. "Good night, Dean."

<br>

#### Act 2

> INT. bunker Cas's room - day (Dean, Sam, Cas)
>
> Cas senses something off in Heaven, Dean senses something off in Cas
>
> Dean suggest take out most of Cas's grace so he goes to Heaven as a near-human, to prevent getting infected by ABD disease
>
> (why Dean can feel something is off in heaven -- he feel it through Cas, profound bond)

Something is wrong.

Something is always wrong, as they often say, with them being Winchesters. But this feels... not really *wrong* wrong, but *off*.

"I don't know how to tell you, Sammy, it's like my hair is in the wrong direction, or... or spider sense gets triggered or something." Dean is a bit irritated, hands flying everywhere trying vainly to compensate for the lack of accurate words. "My gut says so, okay? And I know better than ignoring a hunter's instinct. Something is definitely off but I don't know what. It's like forgetting a dream you just had two seconds ago."

Sam presses his palms on the forehead. They shouldn't have this conversation before they even have their first cup of coffee of the day. And this definitely shouldn't be how the second day after saving the universe starts. But here they are.

"Your gut telling you anything else? A bit more details?" Sam lets his fingers handle the coffee machine in autopilot mode, presses the power button after putting in everything, and turns back to face his brother. "Heaven? Hell? Up? Down? From anywhere? Anyone we can call?"

"It's my gut, Sam," Dean stares at him, "not Google, how the hell would I know?"

Sam sighs. "You sure it's not a post-traumatic stress something? Or a nightmare? Maybe you should just take some more rest. You did only stand up face to face with the full-power Darkness and almost died yesterday after all."

Dean rounds his eyes, his voice on the edge of snapping. "I know what PTSD is, and this ain't that, alright?"

Sam debates whether to point out that Dean didn't handle that well after he came back from Hell or Purgatory no matter how normal he pretended to be, maybe this is just like those times. But judging by Dean's face, he swallows the thought back. "You talked to Cas about that yet?" is what he decides to go with.

"No..." Dean pauses, looks around, pauses again, and then almost amused, "Did... did he oversleep even later than us?"

Sam throws up his hands to mean "I have no idea."

The next thought coming immediately after hits both of them at the same moment. Dean stiffens and Sam straights up from pouring newly made coffee. They share a tense look.

It can't be good. Angels don't sleep, and the few other times when Cas did sleep, he was either dying of a lack of grace or already became human. Or worse, the no-show could be another quiet leave without goodbye where he decides to do his own things, and that usually doesn't turn out very well.

Dean and Sam rush towards the guest room.

Dean gets there first and starts bumping on the door. "Cas, you in there?" He raises voice over his own pounding noise.

A mumbling voice answers from inside, but sounds a hell lot like moaning. Dean lets out a breath that he doesn't know he was holding, but almost immediately holds it again.

They both tilt head and stick closer to the door trying to make out what Cas is saying, but the door that usually is too thin to hold anything back suddenly seems too sound-proof now to catch any sentence.

Dean takes two steps back and lifts one leg, ready to kick his way in, when Sam is right on time to put a hand in front of him to stop. "Whoa, hey, you want to maybe try turn the door knob first?"

Dean gives him a glance, not at all guilty of unable to think straight. "Good idea."

He turns the door knob, and the door opens obediently. Dean deliberately ignores Sam's look on the back of his head.

Cas is in the room, sitting by his clean unslept-in bed, hands pressed firmly on the temple, eyes shut tight, looking too concentrated that it looks very close to pain.

Dean dashes inside, holding him around the shoulder, shaking slightly. "Hey, hey Cas, buddy, what's wrong? What happened?"

Cas looks like he has to take great effort to put his hands down and set the volume in his head lower before he can even try to start talking.

"It's angel radio." He looks at Dean with a grimace, his face wrinkled with pain. "Something is happening to the angels, they're getting sick and dying fast. From what I can hear, it's contagious and deadly. So much voice, so much agony. I have to go now."

"Wait, wait, hold on a sec, Cas, not so fast." Dean presses him back to bed right when Cas tries to stand up. "Contagious and deadly, you say?"

Cas nods. "Yes, it appears so."

"And you are, what, just gonna walk straight into it?" Dean's eyes are practically -- literally -- glaring now, "Like a man walking into a Black Death plague town? Not even wear a mask?"

Cas stares at him, voice starting to get harsh, "Yes! I am not a man, and I have to know more. Angels are dying, I can't just sit here doing nothing!"

"Well, you can't help if you're dead or sick too." Dean points out the obvious, then adds half-heartedly, "Besides, who cares if a few flying monkeys died, not like they're so friendly or helpful in the past. Hell, personally I still think there are too many of them around, might as well..."

"Dean." Sam warns quietly, and Dean shuts up just in time.

Cas shakes off Dean's hands from his shoulder and stands up quickly, steps away from him. His eyes are furious now, and maybe also a little something like hurt. Dean can't say he didn't flinch. It reminds him so much of the very first time seeing Castiel in that barn. Even without his wings, Cas can sometimes still be very intimidating, terrifying even.

"Sorry, didn't mean to..." Dean starts but gets cut off.

Cas grits his teeth. "In case you forget, *I* happen to also be one of the 'flying monkeys.'" The air quotes almost get Dean choked on his own unintended laugh. He has to fight hard to stop the face muscle from twitching.

"They might be ass-butts from time to time, but they are still my brothers and sisters," Castiel says sternly. Dean avoids his glares and can't help but feel a sting in the chest. Even if he understands the saying -- believe him, he really does -- still, the word "brother" might just mean differently sometimes.

"So yes, I am going back to Heaven to see what's happening, to save them if I can. Or die trying," Castiel concludes.

"We'll go with you." Words slip out of Dean's tongue before his brain catches what he's saying.

"Dean, you sure?" Sam speaks behind him, Dean almost forgets he's still there.

Cas's expression softens slightly. "No, you can't, Dean. It will kill you, and you know that. No human can be in Heaven. I have to go alone."

"Or ask the sick ones come down here?" Dean suggests hopefully. "So you don't have to be around all those coughing sneezing guys?"

"Cas, do we know if this angel sickness can pass on to human?" Sam asks reasonably. Dean gives him an appreciated glance, at least some of them are still able to think straight.

Cas looks at Sam for the first time after they burst into the room. "I don't think so," he says after some thought. "Angels technically don't exist in the same dimension as humans, we only manifest into this dimension when we need to. So whatever this is, I don't think it can cross dimension."

"Awesome." Dean's whole body muscle loosens up slightly, "good to know humans won't extinct because the flying dudes poke at the wrong place."

"But I don't think they can be moved to Earth or if they'd be willing to." Cas looks back at Dean again.

"Why not?"

"Would you be willing to go to a strange new place, like abroad or the Moon, when you're seriously sick and dying?" Cas squints his eyes.

"Fair point," Sam admits while Dean makes a funny little defeated sound with his nose.

"So can we all agree now that I need to go? Alone, and immediately?" Cas sighs, getting noticeably more impatient as time passes by.

Sam opens and closes his mouth a few times, looks like he still tries to object but doesn't know what to say. Dean stares at one far end on the wall slightly past Cas's shoulder, eyes unfocused, seems to be deep in thought.

Cas walks towards the door.

"What if," Dean holds out a finger, but still locks his eyes on that spot, not out of the contemplate, "what if you go as a human?"

The room falls silent, Dean looks up to meet two x-ray gazes that are so sharp that he almost can feel the cut on his skin. He shifts his feet uncomfortably. "Hear me out, you said humans can't get infected by this angelic black death, right? And you had been back to Heaven before even without or with little of your grace, so I'm guessing the pure born-and-raised *human*-human is different from the *you*-human. So think of being a human like having a dose of vaccine, what if we somehow drain your grace to *almost* like a human, keep it safe, you go there, do your thing, poke around, solve the problem, and come back juicing up again, voila, problem solved."

"Dean," Sam sighs, "I don't even want to start on how many things can go wrong there."

"I'm not saying I like it." Dean eyes him, then focuses back on the only angel in the room. "Hell, even *I* hate myself for saying that, God knows how tough it is every time see you lose your mojo, but it's still better than deadly sick or die -- a thousand times better. What do you say?"

Castiel considers carefully.

Dean studies him and waits.

Sam watches them both, turning his head back and forth.

"So?" Dean asks hopefully, "Would it work?"

"Probably," Cas says solemnly and slowly. The way he tilts his head, it looks like he's half thinking, half tuning back to the angel radio again. He frowns deeply again then decides, "I'd like to try it."

"Great," Dean says fake-cheerfully, gesturing to his brother and mouthing a silent "See? I'm a genius." Sam snorts with a light curl on the edge of the lip.

"So what do we need?" Sam asks.

"Nothing we don't already have in the bunker." Cas heads toward one of the stock rooms by the library, Sam and Dean follow him closely.

<br>

#### Act 3

> INT. bunker stock room - day (Cas, Dean, Sam)
>
> get the syringe and flask ready, heading out to Heaven's gate

Cas rummages through the drawers in the stock room, making all kinds of noises as random items get moved around.

"There." After a few minutes, Cas fetches a wooden box out of the top drawer, taking it back to the library table.

Inside the box, there is a syringe and a flask. The wooden brown cover of the flask has some mysterious illegible markings and patterns on it, so it might be somewhat unusual or magical, while the syringe looks just ordinary enough to blend in with regular hospital equipment.

"That's it?" Dean eyes them curiously, somehow expecting something fancier.

"Yes." Cas hands him both items. "You can use that to extract my life force and store them in the flask. I expect you may need to repeat the process a few times until I'm drained."

Dean swallows, he doesn't like how the word "drained" sounds like, not at all.

"You sure it's safe?" Dean takes the two things from him, feeling uneasy.

"No," Castiel answers in a low but steady voice, "but as you say, we may not have a better option. I would hope we can execute the process near the gate, so I don't need to stay in the feeble state for longer time than necessary."

Dean pulls a cheerless smile. "Don't use the word 'execute', will ya, buddy? Now I feel like an executioner."

Sam clears his throat behind them to remind the time.

Dean turns to the garage. "I'll get Baby ready in five."

<br>

> EXT. Heaven's gate - day (Dean, Sam, Cas)
>
> Dean extracts Cas's grace to be almost-human, Cas goes to Heaven through the gate

The gate is not guarded by any angel. The whole playground is totally empty, no sign of any human or angel apart from them. Considering most of the angels are probably busy tending their new disease outburst, it's more or less expected.

Dean still frowns at the place. He never likes this place, after the angels made the playground a Heaven elevator portal, nothing good ever happened every time anyone is near here.

The air in the Impala goes quiet for a few minutes after the car parks, all three of them fall into their own thoughts, before Dean breaks the silence. "You ready?" He turns to Cas in the back seat.

"Just do it," Castiel answers gravely.

There is not much space in the Impala to make it a comfortable surgery table, so they have to make do. Castiel leans back on the back seat next to the door with his eyes closed, Dean holds the syringe tight and close to his skin near the neck, and Sam holds the flask besides him, watching them with his worried eyes.

Dean swallows, eyes wandering around Castiel's vulnerable bare skin by the throat, remembering this is exactly how every time Cas got his throat cut and grace taken, now he's trusting him to do the exact same worst thing to him. Dean has to use his left hand to steady the right one, like holding a gun for the first time.

Dean takes another breath, and finally pushes out the last inch. It turns out that it is fairly easy to stab a needle into someone's neck and start extracting -- or maybe it's just the angel biology being different from human, or the syringe isn't as normal as he thought it is. Bright glowing light starts flowing into the syringe, Dean can't help stare at the beautiful light in there, his eyes get caught by the color and brightness of the light uncontrollably, his heart bumps with a sudden knowledge that to some extent, he might be looking at Cas's true form right now, no matter how small the portion is.

When he tears his eyes away, Dean notices Cas clenches his teeth tight with deep lines between his eyebrows. His breath catches pace too, getting deeper and quicker, clearly enduring some huge pain.

Dean stops immediately, though the syringe is already pretty full with grace. He takes the needle out of Cas, asking eagerly with a hand landed on the angel's shoulder, "How you feeling?"

"Continue." Cas breathes out the single word between his gritted teeth.

Dean sighs, pushes the tube into the flask, and starts extracting a second time. And then a third.

Cas looks worse by each minute, sweat rolling down from his forehead, his body sliding down weakly on the seat.

"Okay I don't think we should..." Dean frowns deeply and ready to give up on this terrible plan, Cas is just looking awful.

Cas grabs his wrist to prevent him from taking the needle out. "Keep. Going." His voice is hoarse and husky.

"Tell me I'm not killing you," Dean growls at him.

"You are not." Cas has to catch a breath between every few words. "You're doing the right thing." His eyes are still closed tight, probably to hold back pain, Dean thinks.

"Yeah sometimes the right thing sucks," Dean barks. "Tell me when to stop."

He can see the light in the syringe is already getting noticeably thinner, he can almost vividly imagine the mojo tank inside Cas getting lower as he drains.

"Almost there." Cas holds both hands on the edge of the seat to prevent himself from further sliding down, but even his fingers are too weak now to really do anything. His knuckles are white, more sweat pouring down.

Dean sees it all. "Okay I'm calling it." He decides after a few more minutes, gives up waiting for Cas's signal, taking the syringe away and handing to Sam, like he can't bear to hold the damn thing one more second, like it's a criminal evidence that he's hurting Cas.

Cas breathes heavily, his chest rising and falling with rhythms of an uneven tide on the edge of a storm. Dean feels just as shitty and can't stop beating himself in his mind.

"Ready to take a walk?" He means to use a light joking tone but fails, the concern and worry leaking from his eyes into his voice.

Cas finally opens his eyes and looks back. Dean thinks even the blue in his eyes fades somewhat with the lack of grace, but maybe it's just the effect of the light.

Cas tries to climb out of the Impala on his own but staggers so much he almost falls to the ground, Dean lends his shoulder to help and holds him to the gate.

"Think you'll be alright going upstairs and coming back by yourself?" Dean hesitates by the edge when Cas steps onto the sand.

Cas gives him a weak nod. "I'll be back as soon as possible," he says, in a tone of promise, and then the portal lights up.

Sands rise and spin like a mini-sandstorm. Cas lets out a moan that sounds far too close to a suppressed silent scream, as if he is being burnt alive or torn apart by horses running different directions but uses all his power to swallow back that pain so that Dean might miss it. But Dean didn't. Dean yells his name, can't help himself from instantly reaching out a hand and almost stepping on to the sand, trying to drag Cas back down.

"No, Dean! Don't!" Real panic echoes in Cas's voice.

Dean feels their fingers might have touched for a split second, but immediately there is a force throwing him out. He stumbles back a few steps, by the time he steadies himself again, the sandstorm has settled down, and Castiel is no longer there.

#### Act 1

> EXT. Heaven's gate - day/night (Dean, Sam)
>
> Dean waits outside the gate over-anxiously

Dean walks back to the Impala with a gloomy face, bending over the roof with fingers folded, frowning so hard into the deep space as if he can use the bare stare to tear open the air and squeeze himself into Heaven to help.

"Uh," Sam clears his throat to get his attention, "you want to find a place to rest? He can take days, you know, in case you're thinking about waiting here all the time."

"I'm not leaving till he's back," Dean snaps, his voice way too harsh than necessary. "You see the state he's in just now, he'll need us when he comes back." He thinks and adds, "And he might come back anytime."

"Right." Sam lets out a light sound that's almost like a chuckle if not counting the deep worry, "That's what I thought."

They wait in silence for a long while.

The sun sets down quickly. Dean doesn't pay any attention.

Sam shuffles his feet to keep body warm as the night falls, he asks bluntly, "Is this how things like when you guys were in the Purgatory?"

Dean tilts his head towards him, shooting him a questioning look.

"You know, the whole 'not leaving without him' thing." Sam adds quietly, and then quickly shakes his head. "Sorry, didn't mean to bring it up, you probably still don't want to talk about it."

"Yes." Dean suddenly unlocks, much to Sam's surprise.

"Exactly like Purgatory," he continues. "Even more so when it's time to leave. It's like..." He trails off, getting lost in his memory. The image of Cas grabbing his hands and then slipping back into the monster land is still too vivid, still burns his eyes hot. Even after Cas told him the truth, this is still the memory that hit him more than it should.

"Like what?" Sam's voice brings his mind back.

"Like I can never grab anyone's hand tight enough to pull them out of misery and pain, to really save them. They're just, always, slipping from the hold. Taken away. Lost." Dean's voice cracks, his eyes reflected with shiny stars of lights, his hands fisting by his sides. "All the time."

He keeps his eyes straight into the dark night, doesn't move for the slightest until the shininess slowly slips away.

"Dean," Sam sighs, putting a hand on his brother's shoulder briefly. "Cas will come back, he promised. He always come back to us, to you."

Dean gives him a small grateful nod. "He better does," he says huskily, "or I'll go find him myself and kick his ass."

Sam lets out a short laugh.

The air feels more breathable now. Even just slightly.

<br>

>EXT. Heaven's gate - night (Dean, Sam, dream!Cas)
>
>Dean waits anxiously and has nightmare of Cas getting infected and dying, blaming him for not saving him

They wait and wait. Night turns to day. Sam leaves temporarily on the second day to grab some food and comes back finding Dean sitting on the bench closest to the sand, never leaving his eyes from the portal, as if he's afraid he might miss the angel if he even blinks.

"We can take turn watching." Sam offers, handing his brother a wrapped burger with extra cheese.

Dean bites the food absent-mindedly and doesn't answer. But by the night of the next day, the exhaustion wins the silent argument.

"Wake me up if anything happens. Anything," Dean says for the third time, warningly.

"Yes, yes, Jesus." Sam rolls his eyes. "Now go! Before I drag your ass to the car."

Dean lies down on the back seat of the Impala and immediately falls asleep.

Dreams never serve him well. Endless dreams about the Pit that butchers him, the Cage that swallows his brother, the glowing light that turns his best friend into something horrible, the monster land that keeps all his hair on ends, and then more. Everything he experienced, everyone he lost, he might be able to shove things to the back of his head when his mind is clear, but the dreams always seem to be able to find a way crawl back, digging the old memories back up like a fucking grave digger of his brain, reminding him how fresh those wounds still are.

He rolls uneasily on the back seat, pulling the jacket covered on him, sinking deeper into the dream land. He's too tired, after all.

He is walking into a poor small middle-age-looking village. The houses are shabby, the road is dirty and stained. The whole vision looks bleak, like cutting out from a black-and-white silent movie from 20s. There is no color, no sound, no life. The stains on the road look just like dirt, or maybe what's left of horseshit, if it's an age with horse cart. He doesn't give anything much attention, just keeps walking, having a vague urgent feeling that he is doing something, that he needs to go somewhere fast, that he needs to find something -- or someone -- fast.

And then he sees them, the bodies. Piles after piles of bodies down the road, in front of the houses, down the ditches, and by the road. The stains are not smudge, he realizes, they are blood, too much blood, dripping thickly from these dead bodies, flowing and forming into a stream, then a river. All the bodies have deadly black spots on their faces and bare skins, all have horrified expressions ghosting on their faces long after they can sense anything anymore. All have black charred wings behind their backs.

This is an angel black death town, with no survivors. Dean realizes, appalled by the truth. He walks down the road, doesn't really want to look at any of the bodies or their faces, but the image is shoved right in front of his eyes, he doesn't have an option. They're everywhere. They just look so hopelessly human, no different from dying villagers from a 14th century plague-swept European town, if not counting the wings. Dean feels his heart knotted with twisted apprehension.

He continues walking down the road, not sure what he's looking for or where his feet are leading him to. But in this dream, it seems his subconscious already knows where to go. And his conscious catches up when he finds someone sitting by the corner of a wall, still moving, though barely. He runs to him, kneeling down, and recognizes this is Cas in a heart beat. Except, the body almost looks nothing like the Cas he knows. He's covered with black spots everywhere like everyone else in the town and they're still spreading like the disease is alive, and eating Cas up right before his eyes. Cas's eyes are shadowed with dark fog, his mouth and nose oozing with black goo. He is dying, and Dean can do nothing to save him.

"Cas? Cas!" Dean yells. He doesn't dare to touch him, in case it causes him more pain. His hands reach out to his shoulder tentatively, hover by an inch, but take back hesitantly moments later without contact. All he can do is just keep calling his dying best friend's name.

Castiel hears him. His swollen eyes somehow manage to look through the shadow and look into his.

"Dean?" He sounds unsure, Dean's heart is clenched with pain. "Is that really you?"

"Yeah Cas, it's me." Dean uses his softest voice. "I got you."

"You come." Castiel's face twitches, and Dean realizes he tries to smile but there is not even enough muscle to pull it, he feels his heart is being cut and sliced by the sharpest surgical knife. "You come for me."

"'Course I do." Dean manages to squeeze his sound through the lump in his throat. "You're family."

"Then why, are you coming so late?" Castiel's eyes suddenly turn fierce, rolled and filled with anger and accusation and pain. "They're all dead! All of them. And now it's my turn. Where were you when we need you? Why can't you come earlier? Why can't you save us? Save me? How many times do I have to die for you?"

Castiel suddenly straightens up his body, reaching out and grabbing him by the collar, dragging him closer and cursing to his face, "We are all dead! I'm dead, again! Because of you!" Dean can't bear to look at his eyes, the flame and pain shading all the blue and eating him alive, but he can't move away, either. He shudders, distressed.

"Dean! Dean!" Sam's voice pierces through the veil of dreamland, Dean gasps awake, breathing heavily like a drowning man fighting for air.

Sam is shaking his shoulder, looking more concerned than he already was when Cas walked into the portal.

Dean blinks at his face blankly, shadows of Cas's twisted face overlapping with Sam's, his brain is trying to catch up on the reality while half of his mind still stuck in the medieval town he left seconds ago.

"You okay?" Sam asks, hands leaving his shoulder the moment he sits up. "Nightmares?"

Dean rubs his neck. "Yeah," he moans, "not the best place to spend the night, you know."

Sam examines him, urges to point out that Impala seats usually don't make a person scream angel's name in their sleep, but on second thought, he ends up biting his tongue because he knows far too well Dean wouldn't say a thing what exactly did he dream about.

"Any news?" Dean walks out of the car, still rubbing his back and lumbar. The night is a little chilly. It's not entirely a lie that sleeping in the car is doing terrible things to his almost-forty-year-old spine.

"Nothing changed," Sam answers, "I don't see a single sand move."

Dean nods, and sits back on the bench by the Heaven's gate, silently taking the watch again.

<br>

#### Act 2

> EXT. Heaven's gate - night (Cas, Dean, Sam)
>
> Cas come back from Heaven, weakened, almost dead, (already infected but they don't know yet)
>
> Dean juice him up with his grace
>
> They drive back home

Cas comes back at the night of the fourth day.

He lands clumsily, as if he's shoved down the portal, falling all the way down from the sky and crashing on the ground. Lucky that the sand looks soft enough for the landing that he doesn't break any bones, but his body still makes quite a big thump noise.

Dean and Sam jump to their feet and rush to the messy human figure covered by the crumpled beige trench coat.

"Cas?" Dean gets there first, carefully sets a foot on the sand and puts a hand on his back.

Cas moans weakly, it sounds like even the moaning itself is giving him much pain. His face touches the ground, buried beneath the trench coat like the most of his body. Dean carefully gets the coat out of the way.

Cas is bleeding, blood dripping out of his mouth and corners of his eyes. Cuts and slices are everywhere on his cheeks, neck, hands and any bare skin. His lips are pale white. The shirt is bloody too but Dean can't spare another second to examine. Cas is closing his eyes slowly, like the eyelids are too heavy to hold up and he's just too tired that he wants nothing but to fall into sleep. There is only some last remnant of sparkling blue left in his pupils, which is going out rapidly like a light bulb with its switch turned off.

"Hey, hey! Stay with me, Cas, you hear me?" Dean palms his cheeks gently, feeling his hands quickly covered with sticky blood. The air smells rusty.

"Sammy!" Dean's voice is packed with trembling fear. "Flask!"

The warm wooden flask is slammed into his hands with lid taken off.

Dean puts a hand beneath Cas's head, posturing his head up a little and holding the opening of the flask right in front of his mouth.

"Come on, buddy," he murmurs, bordering to begging or praying, or it really is both. "Come back to me."

Starry flowing light spreads out of the flask, rising and flying in the air like a dance of pure light before sliding into the thin slit between Cas's lips.

"Cas?" Dean lays his head back to ground gently, reaching a finger beneath his nose to feel the breath. Faint air pushes onto his skin, but it only gets weaker and thinner, until completely undetectable.

Dean's heart bleeds painfully. Is it too late? Did they make a terrible mistake and kill Cas, again? And this time, he did it himself? He shuts his eyes and feels his chest too tight to breathe.

The lamps around the playground start flickering, lights going on and off, and then exploding one by one.

"Dean!" Sam calls out alarmingly, gun dropped into hands instantly.

Dean snaps open his eyes and checks on Cas immediately.

Castiel has opened his eyes, though his look is remote and unfocused. Bright blue light fills into his pupils, spreading to his face, his body, and then the space around him. The light soon gets too bright to look, Dean has to look away and cover his eyes with a bent elbow. The air is buzzing with static electricity and heat.

There is a flow of energy rushing towards them and passing by their sides without doing any harm. A word suddenly pops into Dean's mind: "solar wind." He has seen it from some science channel on motel TV some long time ago as a child, introducing how the sun's activity can let out electrical waves and winds of particles that almost look like a visible wind. A wind made of light. That must be what is happening now. Castiel, this beautiful holy creature of light, is letting out a bright rare wonder but he can't see it with his bare eyes, just like he can't look at the Sun. What a loss. Dean is silently in awe for the very few times when he starts to clearly realize the meaning of the word "Angel".

When the buzzing electrical feeling dies down, Dean turns back and opens his eyes again.

Castiel sits up with eyes wide and gentle, locked on him.

"Dean," he says with his low voice. His sounds familiar and deep, though maybe too sad and tired compared to what he used to be, but at least he's not weak or dying or anything along that line. The wounds and cuts all disappeared with that burst of light, and no sign of blood anywhere. Even the clothes are fresh as new.

Here he is, Angel of the Lord with a capital "A", fresh and new. Dean can't stop a smile unfurling on his face. "Cas!" He lets out a long relieved breaths, punching the angel on the shoulder, "Don't do that again!"

Next to them, Sam also exhales in relief.

Dean stands up and holds a hand to pull Cas up. When they head back to Impala and drive back to bunker, Dean even starts humming his favorite Zeppelin song when the tape shuffles to "Ramble On." Sam eyes him with a raised eyebrow in surprise, only to meet a beaty head drum following the rhythm in reply, and can't stop beaming. The weight on Dean's once slumped shoulders is visibly so much lighter now it looks like as if he can float.

Seriousness kicks back in when Dean glances at Cas from the rear mirror and notices his still tensed shoulders. He tunes down the music.

"Okay Cas, fill us in. First thing first, how are you feeling?" Dean asks.

"I'm fine," the angel in the back seat answers. "Not dying, that's an improvement."

Dean narrows his eyes. "What happened up there? Why were you dying again? Did those bastards hurt you?" Anger building up fast, he turns back to look at Cas directly, his right foot unconsciously presses on the accelerator pedal.

"Road, dude, road! Look at the road!" Sam cries out loud.

Dean looks back at the road quickly, releasing the foot pad, the car returns to its previous speed.

Dean still doesn't give up stealing glances of Cas from the mirror. "Is there a name? Anyone I can punch?"

Cas looks like he's struggling with words. Dean frowns. He knows the look, that's the look every time Cas holds something back, usually right before sacrificing himself for something -- or someone. He doesn't like that look.

"Is the problem solved? The disease?" Sam helps out by starting with hopefully easier questions, Cas chooses to go with that first.

"No," he sighs. "It's not that easy."

"Of course not," Dean echoes, unsurprised.

"And, if you really want to know, angels didn't do anything to me, it's just how Heaven works. Without grace, as far as Heaven concerns, I'm just an intruding human that shouldn't be there wandering around, so it would want to keep me there forever inside one of those individual rooms. It wasn't easy to come back. If I'm honest, I didn't even think I could make it." Cas averts his eyes to look at the window, though there is really nothing to see except for pure blackness of the night time.

Dean growls at the road ahead of him, "You knew this is gonna kill you and you did it anyway?"

Cas counters weakly, "No."

Their eyes meet in the mirror, Cas stares back at Dean's glaring eyes. "Yes? Maybe? I don't know how bad it will be, alright? I just saw there might be a shot to help and I took it! Like you and Sam always do!"

Dean is visibly annoyed. "Okay pal, new rule, from now on, every time you need to make a move, tell us everything you know, capiche? Man, we should have this rule like forever ago."

Cas grumbles with widened eyes, "I capiche."

Dean holds back a success grin. "Good," and then, "Now back to square one, what do we know about the situation up there?"

<br>

#### Act 3

> INT. Heaven - day (Cas, angels)
>
> flashback, Cas POV, his time in Heaven, witness infected angels

It is bad.

Castiel knows it's bad before he goes there, but the view still catches him off guard. He gasps in disbelief and pain.

He has never seen so many angels being so vulnerable and miserable.

He has seen enough angels wounded or permanently damaged from the wars back in the old biblical days when he was still in the garrison. His own hands have been covered with too much angel blood in the days when he did the worst wrong of all time. But none of that could compare with what he's seeing now.

It is not like war. It is not massacre. It is extinction.

Full-scale, whole-species, extinction.

The power supply in the Heaven is shaking violently. Power emergency alarm goes off every few seconds. Time flows differently on Heaven and on Earth, and for the mere seconds he sets foot on Heaven, it already weighs more than the eons he has existed.

Angels are dying. Dying in their true forms.

In the Heaven, angels usually choose not to carry their vessels around. So it can be difficult for humans to comprehend -- as he explains to Sam and Dean later, if it's easier for them to imagine, maybe think about suited-up staffs walking around office hallways, but it's nothing like that.

From what he perceives, their existences are more like clusters of light and energy, dispersing and aggregating across the dimensions. And all of that, is dying out. Their lights are shattering, energy draining, grace dissipating, existence disintegrating. It can be explained much easier with a scattering wave function in hyper-dimension and unbounded space, but Sam and Dean would definitely ask him to skip this part.

It's exactly like human's Black Death plague. Cas thinks, Dean is right. Except this is bigger, darker, heavier.

This pandemic is not caused by a lack of hygiene or Yersinia pestis, but by... By what? Cas has no faintest clue. What can possibly destroy Angels of the Lord in this massive scale, with such absoluteness? Not single angel seems to be able to get away from the contagious symptom, dark shadows spreading from one cluster of light to another, entangled into every fiber of energy, eating away the brightness from inside out, erasing the angel's existence like antimatter devours the matter.

If the mixed painful voices in the angel radio were heartbroken, being in the Heaven among them and hearing them up close is truly unbearable. Castiel feels himself being torn apart purely by the agony of the sound itself. It is most horrifying when the last bit of an angel's light gets fully eaten up by the blackness. The frequency of their last cry is the most high-pitched sound even an angel has never heard elsewhere before, piercing and scratching at the back of every angel's mind if they happen to be nearby. For Sam and Dean's understanding, as Cas later describes, think of it as the most painful human moaning and screaming sound when they're being tortured and dying, mixed with the sound of finger nails scraping the surface of chalkboard or screeching metals.

<br>

> INT. bunker - night (Cas, Dean, Sam)
>
> brief discussion of consequence of angel extinction

"Okay, that's vivid enough." Dean cuts him off uncomfortably. "I get it, bad, real bad, horrifying ass-level bad. About right?"

They are back at the bunker now, sitting by the war room table, beers in hand, books by their side.

Cas nods grimly.

"Umm, Cas?" Sam asks carefully, "What will happen if angels really extinct?"

Cas breathes heavily. "I can't imagine," he says after a beat.

"'You can't imagine'? What's that supposed to mean?" Dean demands with narrowed eyes.

"There will be no Heaven. All the souls in the Heaven will be cast in the wind, billions and billions of souls banished to the Vail or the Earth. Or worse, Hell. New dying souls linger in the Vail without a place to go, before the Vail cracks with the burden. That's just the start. What do you think humans would be like when they realize there is no post-life reward after they die? There will be no eternal happiness waiting for them regardless of how much good they do when they are alive or how much pain they have suffered?" Cas tilts his head again at Dean, eyes squinted.

Dean stammers, "Surely the post-life reward can't be the only thing people do good for."

"Some, maybe, but how many?" Cas sighs. "This angel disease -- pandemic -- thing, might not directly infect human, but it can still destroy the world in the end, given time. And we don't have much time left to save it."

Dean shares an alarmed look with Sam. "Annual world-ending event, awesome."

Cas quietly adds, "And there is more."

"More to this crap?!" Dean rolls his eyes.

<br>

> INT. Heaven - day (Cas, Dumah)
>
> Cas's interaction with one infected angel (Dumah) before he's throwing out of Heaven
>
> He knows now this ABD is caused by Darkness

Castiel searches corridors after corridors between souls' individual Heavenly rooms, looking for angel survivors. But he doesn't have much luck.

The place spreads and unfolds endlessly, and his body as a human is tiring out and dragging him back fast. His feet sore and heavy, his mouth dry and burning, he staggers, but keeps moving, though now he has to lean on the wall to keep himself upwards. A traveler lost in the middle of a desert might be in a better state than he is right now. One thread of his mind drifts away to the time when he saw that French writer pilot Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wandering in the desert, finishing his beautiful work of *Le Petit Prince*. His soul is somewhere around here too, if he remembers correctly.

He can feel cracks of wounds popping up on his face and lips, on the back of his hands, and gradually spreading on every part of the body, like a nut shell right before it gets crushed and explodes into pieces. Blood soaking through the white shirt, he doesn't know how much time he has or how far he can keep going. This whole place, the Heaven, is folding around him, grabbing its child in its embrace like a mother to her new-born child. It is his birth place, but it's not the place he would call home right now, and certainly not the place he wants to get captured and forced to stay at this moment. But he also doesn't think he can make it to the portal again.

"Castiel? Is that you?" an angel calls to him from around next corridor. The sound is weak and sick and only echoes its existence in his mind, but picks up sparks of hope at his approach.

Cas fights his way toward the call.

But the whole existence of Heaven pushes harder all around him. The force coming from air presses on him heavily, like a hurricane blowing and surging over a pitiful leaf attached to a tree, pulling him towards the wall, towards a soul room manifested only for him, moving along with him, trying to absorb him in.

The wall becomes too dangerous to hold on to, but as soon as he lets go of the hold, Castiel's human legs give way. He hisses as his body hits the ground and sharp pain spreads all over. He'll die here, Cas thinks, forced against his will to become a permanent resident of Heaven like all those other souls here, locked away in one of those billions of rooms and never see Dean again. He should have hugged him before leaving and said a better farewell if he had known.

"Castiel --" the other angel calls again.

"Dumah." Cas recognizes her voice.

Crawling ahead desperately with the last bit of his strength, Cas arrives at the turn of that corridor. Dumah is there, in her true form, shining faintly and fading. Black shades and dark spots get its hold on to her like every single other angel he sees in the Heaven. Judging by the density of the blackness, she doesn't have long.

Pain and grief tears Castiel's heart apart. The last time he felt so powerless and useless is when he has to watch Dean Winchester being tortured and sliced in the Pit while his garrison still has miles of demons to clear. He doesn't quite understand that sensation of worry and fear back then, but after spending near a decade on Earth, he realizes now that the fear is because he's afraid that he may be too late. The same fear comes back now.

"Castiel, I'm glad you are here." Dumah sends the words into his mind.

"Why -- what is happening here? What is this?" Cas frowns deeply, ignoring his own wounds cutting deeper by the pressure and sharp edge in the air, more blood seeping out from his body.

"The Darkness." Dumah's consciousness is thinning away, so is her life force. Her words can barely form apprehensible meanings through the transmission, but she is trying, holding herself together as long as she can.

Cas leans in to grab at the answer that is surfacing slowly. "But how? She had left this universe. This shouldn't happen."

"The damage was already done when she invaded Heaven last time. All angels were already infected back then, the symptoms only show later. The lower ranks died first, Cherubs, Cupids, the higher ranks came later, Seraphs too, no exception. Everyone in the Heaven will die eventually. Every. Single. One. Of. Us."

"Is that why I'm not infected? I wasn't in the Heaven at that time?" Cas can't help asking.

"Oh but you were. Because Lucifer was."

<br>

#### Act 4

> flashback: INT. bunker kitchen - night (Cas)
>
> Cas's memory when he's possessed by Lucifer, he's inside his own mind that looks like bunker kitchen
>
> He starts to remember when Lucifer was in Heaven and Darkness invades

Castiel doesn't remember much about anything when Lucifer walked him around. The memory is all fuzzy and vague, the image and sound from the outside world was just a low buzzing white noise like the one bunker refrigerator or fan would make.

He managed to find a TV and a place with the best signal in his head -- the bunker kitchen where he shared so many beers and so much laughter and jokes with the Winchesters -- and that's about it. Hours after hours, he just kept his eyes locked on the screen, which was not that different from watching bees. Tiny digital characters moving around on the screen was just like bees flying, even the buzzing sounds were familiar. Castiel didn't really mind if he had to watch them for eons without doing anything.

But then he does start to remember that day when Lucifer visited the Heaven. The same day the Darkness visited. The little TV he held close to his chest had worse signal than ever, images froze a lot, sound track was terribly delayed. It wasn't an easy day inside his own brain, but he decided he didn't really want to know what was happening out there. So he stayed in there, just staring at the snowy laggy TV screen.

And then, it happened. Like an earthquake.

The table was shaking, cabinets and shelves slipping around on the kitchen floor, crashing against the wall and falling to the ground. All the cups and glasses and fragile utensils are shattered to pieces. Cracks showed up on the luminous screen, fragments of glass scattering everywhere. He was afraid the TV might explode, and he briefly worried that, if it does break, how would he kill the rest of the time he'd spend in here -- which is probably, possibly, *forever*.

And then all the lights went out completely at the same time. The whole room fell into pure darkness, and the floor just continued shaking, exactly like an earthquake. The gravity direction shifted abruptly too, changing from downwards to sidewards then upwards. Castiel got thrown across room, hitting the wall next to the door, and then got mercilessly thrown onto the ceiling of the room, crashing onto the ceiling lamp by his back bone, feeling glass and metals stabbed into his skin, and finally ended up with all fours on the ground again, bloodied and motion-sickened.

He had expected Lucifer to show up after that, bragging about what he did today, his cocky voice floating around, filling the space. But no, the Devil didn't show that day. Actually he didn't even see him for quite a while after that. Lucifer must be busy, busy fighting against Darkness and saving the world as he promised, Castiel distantly hoped, but even if he didn't keep his promise, he was sure Sam and Dean would figure something out. They always do, and Castiel only hope this archangel weapon he secured by his body could make that task easier for them.

Castiel didn't connect the dots together then, but he does now. That incident of mere seconds, must be the exact time when the Darkness invaded the Heaven and blew everyone up, Lucifer included.

<br>

> INT. Heaven - day (Cas, Dumah)
>
> continue the conversation between Cas&Dumah, figure out why Cas wasn't initially infected

"Then how am I still alive, not infected?" Cas can't stop the question from rolling out of his tongue by itself. "I should have symptoms just like everyone else. I should have died in direct contact."

The cluster of light and energy that is Dumah contracts and shifts, voice more sluggish by each word. "You... you remember," her rusty voice chokes, breaking and catching. "Lucifer must have warded you off. That's why... why I'm hoping you can fix this, Castiel. Use that power, save us, save the Heaven."

"But I don't know how --" Cas feels uneasy and shameful.

"You will find out," Dumah's voice is barely there, breaking and gasping, like dying human coughing violently, but still somehow fierce and demanding, accusing in its tone. Black shapes and spots splash from the light circling her core, like flying ash and coal from an overburnt fireplace.

And then she starts chanting, breathlessly, like the last dying song of a thorn bird: "*And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness...*"

"I wish I share your belief," Cas murmurs grievingly. "But I'm sorry, I'm dying too, I don't even think I can leave this place any more than you do."

Dumah looks *through* him with the remaining flicker of her light that is barely there. "You will, Castiel. You are the one started it all, you and your little pets, so *you* will fix this. And quickly, save the remaining ones before it's too late. You own this to us!" Her voice breaks into agonizing scratching sound. If she's in a vessel now, it would look like she's choking on blood in her throat.

Castiel doesn't have time to respond when he senses two forces pushing at him at this very same moment as she stops speaking. The Heaven unleashes ever more power onto him, undeniably, irresistibly drawing him in. Castiel can see the space and dimension around them get twisted so contorted that the exit is just like the pinpoint in the eye of a furious hurricane. And Dumah, explodes from the very last peck of power she has left in the center of the light. The explosion wave throws Castiel across the corridor that was never really a corridor and hustles him out toward the gate. He falls right through the portal.

#### Act 5

> INT. bunker library - night (Cas, Dean, Sam)
>
> TFW discuss next move, research to look for solution to save angels

"The next thing I know, I'm on Earth again." Cas wraps up his telling.

"Well, that explains the clumsy landing," Dean comments.

"And the cause of the infection." Sam fills in, thinking hard. "At least now we know what we're dealing with. This, this angel darkness disease --"

"I still prefer calling it ABD -- Angel Black Death," Dean chimes in.

"Fine, this ABD," Sam corrects conformably, frowning deeply at him. "How do we fix it?"

Dean glares back. "Don't look at me, I don't know jack squat about angel biology, how the hell are we gonna play doctor?"

Both brothers shoot their questioning eyes at Cas.

Cas blinks once blankly, looking back at them just as idealess as they are.

Sam clears his throat, suggesting in an over-optimistic voice that sounds far too deliberate, "Okay, how about we stick to the basics, work with what we know, do some research, just like it's just another case?"

"A case," Dean snorts loudly. "Fan-freaking-tastic."

He takes a large gulp of beer that's been staying idly for too long and getting heated by the room temperature and tasting bitter. Dean swallows that sour-bitter taste before saying, "Do you remember our job used to be beheading vampires and werewolves? Not babysitting or feeding them with soup when they get sick?" He holds out a finger just in time to stop Sam from arguing. "Don't give me that look, tell me you don't think angels are just monsters with good PR? No offence, Cas." He flashes a quick eye at Cas. A slow nerve at the back of his head somewhere tickles and tells him that's a really asshole comment spitting in front of his only and best angel friend who barely survived another life-death situation. But with the brain mostly affected by the light drowsiness coming from the beer and the possible sudden drop on the adrenaline now that they're at least all back home again, Dean waves the uneasy feeling off without thinking too hard where it comes from or why.

Castiel barely moves his lips. "None taken."

Sam sighs. "I don't like them any more than you do, Dean, I mean, obviously except for Cas. But that doesn't mean I -- *we* -- would want them all dead. It's bad that they are around, but it's worse if they're not. You heard Cas, I'd rather help them out this once rather than dealing with billions of angry confusing falling spirits -- and don't forget we have so many friends and family up there in Heaven. So yeah, I'm fine with this. And maybe, if they own us one, next time they show up, we won't have to kill each other again."

Dean snorts again, louder. "I'd rather hope they never show up at our doorsteps ever again. But fine, points taken. Where do we start?"

Sam looks at the only angel in the room, which makes Dean turn his head in the same direction. "Start with what we know, about Cas," Sam says.

Dean frowns, still talking to Sam but not lifting his gaze from Cas. "Well, with all due respect, first of all, he's probably the least typical of an angel by now, with all the resurrection -- not that I complain -- and hanging around on Earth with us all this time -- still not complaining -- and everything in between, I won't be surprised if we end up finding out he's a whole new species on his own. And B, what are you gonna do about him? Anatomy? He's not a guinea pig for you to learn biology in college class. He's Cas!"

Cas hums a soft agreement to that obvious accurate comment.

Sam rolls his eyes at his brother exaggeratedly. "I know that, Dean, thanks for reminding. I just mean, research --" He gestures to the mountain of books around them, "-- with some knowledge transfer from Cas about what we might be looking for, so will you just shut up and start reading?" A pause, then adds hesitantly, "Please?"

Cas starts moving toward the books.

Dean returns a cheerless smile to that. "Super. I'll grab some more beer first."

"Some coffee for me would be nice, while you're at it," Sam calls after him.

<br>

> INT. bunker library - night/day (Dean, Cas, Sam)
>
> research get some result, find a lore about potential solution "brightest light", but too vague, needs to figure out what exactly does it refer to -- Michael or Lucifer or potentially both, aim for Lucifer first

As it turns out, the researching and heavy reading part of the job is actually not as boring as one might presume, though it's mostly Sam's expertise. And Cas's.

It would be easier if there is some kind of catalogue to indicate what each book is about, but the perk of not having one is that you get to run into things you totally wouldn't expect to read and ends up might actually learning something or even enjoying the reading time.

Like the one Dean is currently reading, "Ethereal Archetypes and Terrestrial Manifestation: A Comprehensive Ontological Examination of Transcendent Parallels between Angelic Entities and Biological Life Forms" -- which gets picked up because it has "angel" and "biology" in it, he has to look up dictionary to understand what those other words mean -- turns out to be pretty much listing all known creatures and pointing out their similarities and differences with an angel. And Dean has to stifle his chuckle from time to time, and specifically delegates part of his brain to remind himself not looking up at Cas -- who sits just couple feet away from him, buried in his own selection of books -- every other pages just because how accurate the description is.

The book says the angels might adopt their ways of manifestation by learning all animal behaviors, including but not limited to the man kind, examples including the way they tilt heads to examine target objects may come from birds, most likely pigeons; they can be protective and loyal for which canids tend to share the traits, most commonly seem as domestic guarding dogs; territory-aware like wolves, strategic like foxes, emotionally distant like cold-bloods, and show great connection and closeness with creatures that last as long as they do in the history of evolution, so they may guard jellyfish and bees as closely as humans because they exist since Ediacaran billions of years ago.

The more Dean reads, the more he feels like he has to introduce Cas to whoever wrote this book, it is almost as if they are literally describing Cas back to him. But pitifully, the behavioral descriptions are not giving enough information or indication about how exactly can they cure a sick angel. So Dean tosses the book aside, putting a note in his head thinking he might ask Cas some day about what's the deal with jellyfish.

The next book talks about hierarchy and structure of Heaven and Hell and their resemblance, which leads to deductive religious and cultural meaning. But Dean already notices quite some mistakes in the book with his own first-hand experience to know the book is of no use to him, and he seriously doubts if any of the Men of Letters scholars have ever run into any Prince or Knight of Hell. He might as well run a fact check with Cas about these things.

The next is about angelic occupational division, followed by magic experimentations and enchantments with angel feathers, and then more. Okay, Dean decides, he wants to take his words back, it stops being entertaining a long time ago, now he'd rather go out get some stretch or maybe punch something, or even wash his car again regardless how clean she already is. The only thing that keeps him trained in the seat and continue scrambling the pages is the tiny bits and pieces of information scattering around the pages about angels -- about Cas -- that makes him feel somehow he gets to know Cas slightly more as he reads. *Could be handy*, he thinks to himself, *later down the road. Maybe just a small thing he learns today could turn out saving Cas's ass some day in the future.*

So he keeps going. The books piling high from his left side get moved to his right side as he goes.

By the time he clears out all the books piled on his left side, Dean can barely recognize the word "angel". His brain has already rewired the meaning of that word into -- "Cas".

Right around the time when Dean wonders if he can sneak out of the room without the rest two of them noticing, Sam shouts out his eureka, "I find something! Hmm, maybe. I think."

"Aren't you a scholarship boy?" Dean gratefully lays down the book in his hands that must have more than a thousand pages with packed tiny fonts without any picture, and gets up promptly. "What do you get?"

Dean and Cas gather around him, each taking a side of the chair and leaning on the armrest over Sam's shoulder.

Sam fingers the line he's reading. It's Enochian. Apparently Sam must have learnt to read Enochian some time ago secretly and Dean is the only one in the room blinking blindly at it right now.

Cas translates for him: "*The brightest of all light can purify darkness.*"

Sam points at a short line of hand-written notes in the margin right by the Enochian, "I'm actually reading this note."

Dean leans closer. "'*Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that.*' Why does that sound so familiar?"

Sam answers immediately, "Martin Luther King Jr."

"And that's connected to our problem how?" Dean frowns, letting go for once to not mock at Sam's obsession with these historical figures that he can never understand.

"I'm thinking," Sam grooms through his thoughts with waving hands, "if that Angel Black Death plague is a symptom when angels get in too close contact with Darkness, and angels' true forms are like flowing lights, then it's practically *literally* a metaphor to say 'Light is getting consumed by the Darkness'. With the opposite of light -- the absence of light -- in their system, angels can't heal, that's why they're dying, and eventually all lights get consumed and they end up dead. It sort of makes sense."

"And so the cure is... giving them more light?" Dean tries to catch up, connecting the dots.

"Yeah, it's either that or ask their Father or Aunt for help... but I don't think we can get Chuck or Amara back to fix this -- even if we can, to be honest, I don't really want to see them again so soon." Sam ponders. "So the only option is just this --"

"-- the brightest of all light." Cas finishes his sentence. "But what does that mean? Who has -- or, what *is* -- the brightest light?"

Realization hits all three of them at the same time. Though it comes with different names.

Sam stuns and breathes, "Lucifer."

At the very same moment, Castiel says, "Michael."

Dean blinks once, then goes, "Cas."

Sam turns to Cas, "What?"

Dean eyes Sam, "Really?"

Cas looks at Dean, "Yes?"

Dean stutters, "No, not calling you. Just thought you get pretty bright light, buddy, so bright it almost burned my eyes off, like, yesterday. Pretty sure it's the brightest *I*'ve ever seen."

Castiel lowers his head sheepishly. "I'm flattered, Dean. If it's true, I have no problem giving away any and all of the light I have to save the angels. But sadly it is not, I'm hardly bright at all from a normal angel's standard right now, with all the extraction and resurrection."

Dean can't help breathing out a short relieved breath, not sure if he should feel glad or sorry for it. He murmurs a quick "Sorry" under his breath.

Sam is still staring at Cas. "Michael?" his tone incredulous.

Cas turns to him to answer, "Yes, as far as I know, Michael is the first archangel God created, the strongest and the most powerful among all angels and archangels, it wouldn't be a surprise if he is also the brightest."

Sam nods slightly but still not fully convinced. "Doesn't Lucifer also have a name called 'Morningstar'? I thought before the Fall, he was believed to be the brightest by many according to the lore. I mean, isn't that why Michael and Lucifer fight in the first place? Fighting for the title of 'brightest' or 'God's favorite' or something like that, it's like Heaven's version of Golden Apple Contest, and Apocalypse is exactly like Trojan War. Not to mention he *did* ward you off when Amara was in Heaven last time."

"Jesus, when can we ever break free from these two bastards," Dean whines loudly before Cas can answer, then asks. "Say we have two candidates, what's next?"

"We need them to, uhh --" Sam skims through the small texts below the Enochian line quickly -- luckily the rest is in English. He scans fast for the next few lines, his brows raising higher as he reads if it's even possible. "Huh -- give away their light willingly. The cost of purification can take away as much as all the light from the source. And only a determined mind can last long enough to not disrupt the purification process before complete, or all is wasted."

Dean steps away from the armchair slowly to lean his hip on the table. "Wait so, let me get this straight, the solution is to let Michael *or* Lucifer to -- what? Willingly sacrifice themselves to save all angels and humans? You ever met those two bastards? Don't think it's gonna happen till the end of the world. They might as well *want* the world end and all angels dead!"

Sam thinks about it for a second. "I don't know, Dean, I mean, we got some big guys talking to us, and persuaded them to do the right thing. I'm talking about God himself, and Devil, and Darkness, and even Death -- and most of the times, they ended up listening to us."

"I actually find it rather miraculous," comments Cas.

"We might as well put up a sign in front of the bunker: 'Celestial family drama counseling office', small print: 'For free once a year, if it doesn't work, feel free to end the world'. Nice plan, Dr. Phil." Dean waves his hands in the air, gesturing the imaginary signs.

"You get a better plan?" Sam raises his brows.

Dean stammers, turning to Cas for support, and in return the angel only gestures to Sam, very clearly showing the sign of "You know Sam is right" without actually saying it.

Dean sighs, annoyed but submissive, "I have a bad feeling about this. When can we get out of this we'll-end-the-world-or-the-world-will-end crap? Shit just never stop hitting fans!"

Cas gives him an upset smile.

Sam sighs a soft "Yeah" and falls to silence.

#### draft notes

The quote "Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that." The second half is: "Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that." They didn't read it here but that's exactly going to be what save the world (and Cas): Love.

### Chap. 3: Rock Never Dies

> look for Lucifer, Lucifer holds rock music festival in LA, a big fuss and fight like in show, reuse Vince Vincente/Ladyheart part plot, bring Lucifer in in Vince's vessel, help Lucifer recover - ask Crowley to rebuild Nick's body to help him strengthen (Lucifer suggest get Michael but they initially refuse)
>
> Cas show initial negligible sign of sickness, heal slow, easy to get tired, sleepy

#### Act 1

> INT. show dressing room - night (Vince, Jen!Lucifer)
>
> Vince POV, Lucifer possess him as his latest vessel

(**Words before chapter**: Some of the following parts heavily reuses S12 canon plot when Lucifer possess Vince Vincente.)

<br>

Vince Vincente is not having a good day.

The show tonight was actually great, Tommy and the rest of the band were over excited, the crowd was loud. Though honestly, he doesn't see the point of having a regroup performance for the Ladyheart, he's just doing those old friends a favor.

"They are hosting the biggest rock music festival on the planet and they invited us," Tommy told him on the phone when he was driving half way across the country. He didn't bother to ask who are "they" but just listened.

"I think it would be nice to have a reprise, you know? Get a few concerts for some practice run, find the old feelings like we are still twenties," Tommy talked faster and faster, undoubtedly taken away by the imagination, feeling young again.

"And then in the festival, bang, we show up, we sing, we might go back on top again. Who knows, it can be another 1985 Live Aid again, you might regret the rest of your life if you turn this down. So what do you say? You in it with us, Vince?" Tommy urged him.

"Okay then," Vince answered plainly, uninterested but he knew better than disappointing the only few friends he still had.

"Oh and, one more thing," Tommy added hesitantly, "it's gonna be in LA, you ok with that?"

He is not ok with it. Not at all. He said "Sure" back then in the phone just to make Tommy's life easier, but it's making his life back to Hell again.

"Jen." Vince sits down in front of the makeup mirror, looking down at the photo of the woman he loved and lost thirty years ago.

This place, Los Angeles, it's where everything between them started and ended. He has been avoiding the place for thirty years, but now he's back again.

Memory devours him like rising tide devouring a novice surfer. Vince can't really breath, his chest is clenched too tight.

"Vince--" a woman's voice is calling him, barely audible, familiar and alien. Sounds everything like his Jen, and everything that is not.

"Jen?" he answers automatically, looking around. He can tell Jen's voice from anywhere.

But he's all alone. Remote chatters and music drifting from outside the door, but inside, he's pretty sure he's all alone. The single light bulb on top of the make-up mirror flickers once. Thin curtain floats gently in the night wind. Might just be the sound of the wind then.

*Too tired and too messed-up maybe? That he even started hallucinating her voice?* Vince mocks at himself. If it's punishment, he deserves it. It was all his fault, after all.

Night wind blows into the room, cold, this time, giving him a shiver. It's almost summer time in Los Angeles, even the night time shouldn't be this cold. A thin thread of thought wonders briefly but drops the attention after a blink.

He only glances at the window briefly. The white curtains fly up in the wind ominously, rustling, fluttering, like a woman's dancing dress. Or a woman's swaying skirt when she is falling from the penthouse in a free fall.

*Jen has a skirt just like that.* His mind frantically thinks, panic starts climbing from his spine.

"Vince--" The voice gets louder, the sound of breath gets mixed in the wind.

Vince holds his hands on his temples, shutting his eyes. "Jen, please--" he pleas, tears gathering in his eyes.

He feels the floor shake. Once, twice. But is it earthquake or his leg shaking, he cannot tell.

He thinks the lightbulbs over the mirror start flickering again too. More intensely going brighter then darker, and brighter again, prickling his closed eyelids, leaving them hot and pained. Or maybe it's just the tears making the effect.

He swallows hard over the lump in his throat, letting the tears fall. "Jen, I'm so, so sorry--" he talks into the cold night wind in the middle of the room.

"Why?" she asks gently. Her voice so soft, so real, far too solid to be a hallucination from sound of wind.

Vince snaps up his head and stares through his teary eyes.

Undoubtedly, Jen stands right there, in her beautiful white dress, even still wearing her favorite lipstick color, the sparkling pink. He remembers it tastes like strawberry like yesterday. They would have kissed, and hugged, and had so much joy in each other's embrace, if she didn't -- if he didn't --

Vince breathes heavily. "Is this a dream?" he whispers, looking around the room again as if it can give him some answer, not daring to breathe as if it will blow the image of his love away.

"No, my love," Jen smiles at him, walking closer, "not a dream. I'm here." The edge of her dress floats around her bare feet. She walks over to him.

Vince can't do anything but stares at her movement, taking her in. Jen lands a hand on his cheek, caressing the stubble.

"I'm right here." She smiles gently, looking into his eyes. "But you didn't ask the right question."

"Are you --" Vince stumbles, tilting his head, leaning into her hand. He blinks the tears away to take a proper look at the woman standing inches away from him. He takes another deep breaths, asking shakily, "-- are you really you?"

"No," the woman that looks like Jen answers, her smile not fading but growing warmer, her hands still moving on Vince's face. "Better. I'm an angel."

Vince can't tear his gaze away, he can't move his head or body away, he just can't. Everything in her is drawing him in, and he's too tired to think or resist. He leans in more, dropping his head so his lips are almost already ghosting around her skin.

"Angel..." he murmurs under his breaths, his brain failing to register the meaning.

"I can't bring her back," she says as she moves the hand to his scalp, fingers lingering on his hair behind the ear, "but I can make the pain go away."

She tiptoes slightly, her mouth right next to his cheek now, mild airflow brushing by his face, mixed with a faint taste of fruity sweetness. Vince closes his eyes, indulging himself in the memory when Jen did that because she knew how much he loved it.

"As long as you say yes." Jen's voice blends with the image in the memory. Vince doesn't need to be told twice.

"Yes," he chokes in shaky, teary voice, opening his eyes to look into his love's eyes.

"Yes," he says again, feeling the pressure in his chest releasing as the syllable leaving his tongue.

Jen rounds her arms around him, then her figure dissipates. The lightbulb behind him flickers violently and finally goes out with a loud explosion sound.

Vince staggers briefly, takes two steps back before stabling himself.

He opens his eyes and looks into the mirror in the dark.

Two bloody red eyes look back at him.

Lucifer grins.

<br>

#### Act 2

> INT. bunker kitchen - day (Dean, Cas, Sam)
>
> look for Lucifer, find Lucifer host rock music festival in LA

Dean walks into the kitchen in his favorite dead man's robe, rubbing his eyes while yawning.

"Morning," Sam greets him from on top of a plate of spinach omelet, accompanied by daily news research on his laptop.

Cas is sipping a mug of hot coffee, held in both hands, fully concentrated. His hair is more ruffled than usual, probably from sleeping. Dean gets reminded again that Cas is still recovering from the grace extraction, which makes sleep a necessity and morning temper a fundamental feature.

He regards him fondly, holding back a small smile. "Morning, Sunshine," he says.

"Hello, Dean." Cas doesn't look up, fully occupied by his coffee.

Dean heads directly to the coffee machine. "Any news for today?" he asks, speaking over his back.

"Maybe," Sam answers, pressing a button on his laptop.

Lousy music comes out of the laptop's player. Strong beat, roaring lyrics, the mixed guitar and bass and electricals sound like they would regret their life if not breaking a string or two at the end of each song.

Dean covers his ear with one free hand, grimacing as the metal bombing on his sanity. "What the devil's music is that? Put that crap away, will ya? Since when do you listen to those?"

Sam pauses it mercifully. "That's exactly what I'm thinking -- Devil's music."

"Wait, you mean, literally? Not figure of speech?" Dean lowers the hand covering his ear, walking over to the desk, asking Cas to "Scoop over" so he can sit right in between the two of them and still steal a glance at the laptop.

Sam shows him a page that print out the lyrics of those hideous songs. "So, get this -- there is going to be rock music festival in Los Angeles, presumably the largest one ever held since Live Aid."

"So? It's LA, people do crazy things all the time." Dean squints at the screen, sipping at his coffee.

Cas is about finishing his coffee by then, turning to stare at the same screen with a small frown.

"Yeah, I thought so too, but see what I find in the lyrics." He scrolls the page down a little, pointing at the notes he put together earlier.

Dean reads them out:

*"Down and out as Darkness falls, shakes the Cage in deep withdrawals. Without Darkness there's no light, but he is someone's little boy."*

*"Perdition awaits, my soul is at stake. Will I find a stairway to the skies in the end?"*

*"I've been in Hell for many years, and all the time is lost for me, for eternity. I try to take back what was mine, a prison they have made my mind, my enemy."*

Dean comments: "Okay, the last one especially. That seems just a bit on the nose."

Sam nods, "That's what I thought. They might be onto something. What do you say, let's check out LA?"

Cas says slowly, eyes still on the music screen, "Why would Lucifer start composing and singing songs in a music festival? That doesn't sound very devilish, for one. And no one dies there, which doesn't sound like Lucifer, either."

Sam takes his laptop back, tapping the keyboard to search weird things or unusual death report in LA recently, which doesn't give much result.

Dean shrugs. "I don't know, dude might just want some fun after that big fight with Amara? Too drained to do any killing anymore, so that's just his way of a down time, perhaps? Hell, that's Lucifer we're talking about, who knows what he'd do or wouldn't? I'd send him a basket for not dropping bodies. Anyway, that's the best lead we got so far, I say let's check it out. At the worst, we get some free beer in the festival. You in it with us, Cas?"

Cas nods solemnly. "Of course."

<br>

> INT. Car - day/night (Dean, Sam, Cas)
>
> Cas show initial negligible sign of sickness, heal slow, easy to get tired, sleepy, headache
>
> (The headache is just the first symptom of infection, they just didn't know yet)

It's a twenty-hour drive from Lebanon to LA. Dean says he can probably make it fifteen if he rushes through the desert and all those desolate roads that don't have any other cars in sight. And Sam offers to switch driving for him to have a few hours of close-eyes on the shot gun seat. So that saves a lot of time too.

And during the most time of that drive, Cas is either sleeping or rubbing his temple uncomfortably, shifting in the back seat with a frown.

Dean glances at him through the rear mirror from time to time, until he finally can't keep holding his tongue. "You alright there, Cas? Need anything?"

Cas takes his hands away from his temples slowly, just to keep his whole posture still and controlled. "I'm fine," he answers gravely.

Dean squints at him, finding his shoulders strained from the control. The crinkles between the angel's eyebrows are knitted into deep lines from frowning for too long.

"It's the angel radio, isn't it?" he asks, knowingly. "You're still hearing their screaming, and it's bothering you every breathing minute?"

Cas lowers his eyes. "Yes," he says quietly.

Dean watches him closely, voice worried. "You want to tune that down a bit? No need to keep torturing yourself, you know. We are already doing our job. There is nothing you can do."

"I know," Cas says, having to press his temples again just as he answers, Dean imagines that's another terrible wave of deathbed crying upstairs just then. "I can't -- I won't. My brothers and sisters are suffering and dying up there. The least I can do is not to forget that."

"Yeah, not like you can ever forget anything easily just like that," Dean says. What he means is *I hate to see you suffer*, but he doesn't say that. Just presses on the acceleration petal harder, pushing Baby to dash toward LA as fast as she could.

<br>

#### Act 3

> EXT. rock music festival - LA - night (Dean, Sam, Cas, Crowley)
>
> go to LA concert, run into Crowley
>

The music festival is going to last a whole week, according to that gothic girl they met outside the field. They are there the third night, hardly missed anything good. The air is just heating up. Dean tells her they're all huge hard-core rock fans, driving all the way west to witness the whole thing.

The girl lets them in after ten minutes of talk. Dean can't say he's not pleased to know his grin and wink still work like a charm nowadays.

The festival is host in a wide field outside the city. Dean remembers seeing old TV news from Las Vegas music festival back when he's still a teenager, and thinking going to one of those festivals would be one's ultimate bucket list, 'cause Dad is never going to take them there. He didn't even bother mentioning. And now he's here, with Sam and Cas, not to enjoy the time and music and all the craziness a rock festival has to offer, but to capture the Devil himself, as if their lives aren't messed enough. Just great.

They move their way through crowd toward the stage -- it's so much more difficult than they thought possible. The music already started -- Dean suspects it ended since three days ago -- which means the crowd never stopped moving and crushing with the music. They feel like as if trudging through rain-coated woods, each step plodding in the mud.

Dean leads the way, splitting the crowd before him and squeezing through, hoping Sam and Cas can stick together closely enough not to get lost. It would be a hell of a trouble to find lost ones in crowds like this -- too loud to hear, too bright to see, just blind and deaf --

Which is of course what ends up happening.

"Keep close!" He yells back, trying to turn his head back from time to time, but his voice is overwhelmed by the music and crowds so easily, and the space between all those audience is tight even for breathing, let alone turning around. All he can see are the men and women wavering with the music rhythm. He has to just continue moving regardless.

Until Dean finally reaches close enough to the stage and the side signs that pointing to the back stage, he finally gets to take a full breath. From this distance, he can see those so-called rock stars' faces when they are howling songs like "Heaven is too far away from me", "Devil is calling me to join", or something of that kind -- which, is a little difficult to tell if it's Lucifer has dipped his fingers in the song or just generally how people nowadays love to hear. Dean turns around, not finding the two familiar figures behind him. He shouts their names.

But the only one answers him is -- "Hello, Squirrel."

"Crowley," Dean glares at the demon in elegant black suit, sipping his little colorful drink -- where did he get that little umbrella drink in the middle of nowhere?

"Didn't think to meet again so soon," Crowley smiles pretentiously, "but hello again. What are you doing here, busy losing Moose and your boyfriend?"

Dean scans around, looking for the human giant that should stand out of the crowd but find nothing. He sighs. Not wanting to admit the defeat, he asks instead, "You see them?"

Crowley huffs, making a pretense of standing on his toes to search around, then shrugs. "Somewhere around here," he says carelessly. "You'll find them once trouble comes, you know, that rule with you Winchesters? Just look at the place where shit hit fans, you'd find them right under that fan. Which reminds me, why are you here again?"

Dean rolls his eyes. "Look for Lucifer." He glares back. "Why are *you* here?"

"I can't just come here listening to some music?" the demon says grudgingly. "Some of the songs are actually good here, very suitable to Hell. I might consider borrow some idea."

"No," Dean tells him, "I don't buy it."

"Fine," Crowley's shoulders slump a little, but he still maintains a forced cheerful smile. "I'm following Lucifer too. My last lead says he's now possessing a poor bastard called Vince Vincente. Happy now?"

Dean shrugs dismissively. "What do you know about him?"

"Just some old-fashioned second-tier star like any out-dated Hollywood stars getting all lusty for attention after they're not young or beautiful or famous anymore," Crowley says nonchalantly.

"No, not the rock star, Lucifer!" Dean cuts him off.

"Oh," Crowley pauses. "Not much, just that he's probably pissed. And probably -- hopefully, weak enough to be killed."

"We're not going to kill him," Dean says.

Crowley narrows his eyes, "Remind me again why you're chasing Devil's tail if not to kill him? You know, for wearing your beloved angel around like a prom dress. Last I remember, you're all in for let Devil be damned as long as Feathers is in one piece."

Dean is just about to answer, when -- "Dean, where have you been? Cas and I were looking for you."

Sam emerges from the crowd, Cas closely behind.

"Where have *I* been? Where have *you* been! I was just thinking about calling those child-lost broadcast, you know, looking for two lost kids coming to the backstage." Dean stares at Sam, then checks on Cas.

Cas's eyes are on Crowley. "What are *you* doing here?"

"Why do I always get interrogated like I did something wrong?" Crowley complains loudly. "Can't I be doing something just so happened to help you out? Not that I'm counting, but it's probably... let me see..." he bends his fingers and pretends counting quietly.

"Alright, whatever." Dean bats his half-bent fingers away. "You say you're helping, then help! How do we get to Lucifer?"

"Not until you tell me why you need him -- alive. I've been working my ass off trying to figure out a way to permanently shut that fucker's mouth off." Crowley grits his teeth.

"Why are we working with the demon again? I thought you are usually against it, Dean." Cas chimes in.

"Not working, just so happened to run into him." Dean shrugs slightly. "Call it fate."

Sam sighs, giving way. "We needs his help -- or actually, not *we* we, angels. Angels are dying and we needs either him or Michael to save them -- and the world."

"Splendid, you got my attention right at 'Angels are dying'," Crowley shows a practiced smile. "When shall we start celebrating?" He raises the cocktail glass in his hand, pretending a toast, sipping a small sip.

He then turns to Cas, "Does that mean Upstairs is short of staffs again? My, my, isn't it just like old times, when you and I were hand-in-hand Thelma-and-Louise? For old times' sake, I can loan you some demons to take those probably short-handed administration works, what do you say?"

"Crowley! Fuck, no!" Dean shoves Cas aside, warning the slimy demon with a low and tired voice, just as Cas glares and growls, "No!"

"Alright that, you three, focus!" Sam says, putting a hand on Dean and Cas each, eyes on Crowley. "Lucifer is our biggest problem -- and solution here. Can we please focus?"

Crowley shrugs with his eyebrows flying up and down. "You said you could use Michael too, and you know exactly where he is, saving you all this trouble running around the town. So what do you say let's kill Lucifer together, then I don't care what you do with the other big brother douchebag?"

Sam turns to Cas for help.

Cas answers for him, "Michael is not going to be pleasant for staying in the Cage for the past six years. It might be difficult to reason with him."

Dean chimes in with a humorless chuckle, "Oh, and Lucifer will? For being there since the Dawn of everything and what happened last year?"

"At least we have dealt with him before, we know what he is like -- or was, until Amara tore him out of Cas," Sam says reasonably.

"And he might be weak after the fight. Hopefully it would make him more... persuasible." Cas considers the word carefully.

Dean huffs a laugh. "Is that even possible? The Devil? Persuasible?"

"Only in your best dream," Crowley says.

"My best dream doesn't include Lucifer, thank you very much." Dean rolls his eyes, then turns to Cas again. "Oh, and, before I forget --" He pokes a finger at Cas, so close to him it almost stabs on his chest, just in case it doesn't emphasize enough, "-- don't you ever EVER think about saying 'Yes' again, you hear me? Under no circumstance. Even if the world's ending the next minute. Even if it's Earth is going to explode, Sun crashes, whatever, just, NEVER to that again!"

Cas starts with a weak "Dean --"

Dean snaps, "Don't. Just -- just don't. I can't go through that again, or you might as well kill me."

"That might make things a bit easier, I agree," Crowley comments unhelpfully.

"You shut your mouth," Dean doesn't even bother looking in Crowley's direction, maintaining his stare with Cas. "Just, promise me, don't do that again -- or we call this off. Whatever reason Devil may trick you, and boy, he knows how to trick."

Cas has to nod faintly.

"Not even if I'm dying or whatever, and he says that's the only way to bring me back," Dean amends.

Cas widens his eyes, his temper rising quickly. "Dean! You can't ask that --"

Dean ignores his protest. "Cas," he says in a calm voice, low, but so much underlying pleading tone. "Promise me?"

Cas glares at him. "You're just being unreasonable." He turns and ready to move toward the back stage.

Dean puts his hands on Cas's shoulder just in time to stop him.

Cas stops his steps, but not looking back.

Sam looks at them with an almost amused look, and Crowley says, "Look at you two, just like old bickering married couple."

Dean glares at Crowley, then points his free finger at Sam. "What's so funny? You too! Don't even think about that! Can't believe Lucifer already tricked the both of you. Can't let that happen again."

Sam stops his uncontrollable grin, the muscle at the corner of his mouth twitching. "Fine," he says.

Dean eyes Cas's back with a sigh. "Alright, listen up. Crowley got some actual news for us," he eyes the demon, "why don't you catch us up?"

Rarely obligingly, Crowley gives Cas and Sam a recap on Lucifer and his new vessel, the rock star named Vince Vincente -- whom, surprisingly, among all of them, Sam is the only one heard of the name and his band.

"According to my little birds, his big performance is right tonight." Crowley announces at the end, then checks his shiny costly watch. "And looks like -- about time."

He snaps his drink away, straightens his suit, looks around them and smiles his iconic patented bright smile. "It's been fun, lads. Now if you'll excuse me --" He's ready to step away.

Dean and Sam reach for their hidden pistol automatically. Cas readies himself in a gait like he used to do every time before big fights, shaking his sleeve to prepare grabbing the hidden angel blade.

"The Hell you will," Dean snaps.

The three of them automatically form a half circle around the demon without needing a word.

Crowley eyes them with open amusement. "Really? You are about to start a fight *here*? In front of a hundred thousand human? You guys are more bold than I thought. By 'bold' I mean braindead."

Dean exchanges a look with Sam and Cas, lowering his voice. "And running straight into Devil without backup is your idea of *not* braindead?"

"I got a plan," Crowley says, a bit annoyed now. He glances at his watch again.

"Then spill," Sam demands harshly.

Cas takes a step closer menacingly.

The demon sighs -- which Dean's pretty sure is just another of his Crowley-branded pretended sigh -- then finally loosens: "Who said anything about 'No backup'?"

<br>

#### Act 4

> INT. music festival backstage - LA - night (Rowena, Lucifer)
>
> Rowena fake helping Lucifer, carry on with her previous plan with Crowley

"You got some nerve come here, Red." Lucifer looks out at the slim woman before him through Vince's eyes. He doesn't even bother getting the band members out of the green room -- not that he cared, or they care, really. "Just a groupie," he told them.

Rowena doesn't seem to mind that term either, or if she did, she doesn't show.

"Lucifer," she calls the Devil's name sweetly as if a lover -- she does play the role perfectly. She wears a bloody red long dress tonight, fitting her well.

"My Lord," she glances at him through her long upper eyelashes, blinking sheepishly. "If there is anything I can do for you, just ask --"

"You got any beauty spells locked up in that witchy brain of yours?" Lucifer touches the skin on Vince's face, turning to the lightened-up make-up mirror. Dead skin falls from where his fingers touch, leaving ashy traces. The vessel is degrading fast. "I got a big show tonight."

"Of course, do you want to cover that up or something more permanent? Making this vessel stronger, perhaps? Strong enough to hold you?" Rowena wanders behind him, eyeing the Devil and his reflection in the glass. She reaches for her handbag left on the green room couch.

"It does look good on me, don't you say?" Lucifer regards himself, lifting the chin to check the body he's in up and down. "Show me what you got, will you?"

Rowena has her back toward Lucifer now, glancing at her phone rapidly, typing quietly while stammering, "I-I-I'd help, I would, but I don't have the Book of the Damned with me. I lost it."

Lucifer tuts loudly, turning to her. "You know damned well where you put it. Did you see what I did there? 'Damned.' Besides, you don't need the book. Clever girl like you must have it all up here by now." He points at his head, then Rowena's.

Rowena sneaks the phone back into the handbag, taking a step back from Lucifer. "And if I refuse?"

Lucifer smiles wide and sweet, "Then I snap your neck again. Only this time, I'll rip your head clean off afterwards and burn your bones to ashes. We clear?"

Rowena curls her lips unhappily. "Yes, my Lord," she says obligingly, rummaging her handbag again to pull out a handful of herbs. "Shall we begin?"

<br>

> INT. music festival backstage - LA - night (Sam, Dean, Cas, Crowley, Rowena; Lucifer)
>
> fight Lucifer together, a big fuss and fight like in show S12E03 (reuse Vince Vincente/Ladyheart part plot), bring Lucifer back to bunker in Vince's vessel

So that is the scene they run into -- Rowena dipping her finger in some mixture of herbal water, painting on the bare chest of a man that is, to be honest, not that bad looking. The man was a little well-known rock star back in the day anyway -- he got the build and the look.

Crowley stands in the doorway, clearing his throat deliberately. "Is this a bad time, Mother? Shall I come back later?"

Rowena takes a loud exhale and immediately steps back. "About bloody time!"

She chants a short prose of Latin with lips flickering rapidly, ending with a fierce "FES... TI... NA!" Her eyes turn purple, while the pattern on Lucifer's chest burns into the skin like a branding.

Lucifer yells with surprise. Larger patches of skin fall from his body, decaying like an old tree's bark. He gasps in fury, "Red, what did you do?!"

Rowena pants heavily as she still holds out her hands toward Lucifer, "Sped up the decaying process, My Lord. You thought Keith Richards was bad? Try Iggy Pop!"

Lucifer growls, swooping toward her, "Decapitation is far too merciful for you, Ginger Bitch!"

Rowena raises her hands high in the sky, chanting even faster than before. Lucifer's steps stagger, falling to his knees to the floor.

"Mother, wait! There might be a small change in the plan," Crowley says by the door.

Rowena turns to him, with purple magic lights still bright in her pupils. Power of magic flies around her like a visible electric field. "Is that why you're taking so long, Fergus? Fraternizing with the Winchesters? Are you trying to turn against me, again?"

Lucifer starts laughing and pulling himself up from the ground, forcing Rowena to shift her attention back to him. The Devil's legs are still shaky, but his eyes glint with humorless laugh. "I see you brought quite some familiar faces. What's this, a friend reunion again? So soon? And all for me?"

He raises a palm suddenly and tears the door frame off. "You know I can feel you from a hundred yard away, Castiel. You think you guys can surprise me? Why don't you come out and play?" His pupils turn devilish red, staring at the door's direction as if they can literally breath out fire.

Dean and Sam rush to the poor civilians that are caught in the middle of a war zone -- the drummer and those other ones from the Ladyheart band -- right now hiding behind the sofa and in the wall corner, not having the faintest clue what's happening. They manage to get them out while the Devil's attention isn't on them.

Castiel steps toward Lucifer with his angel blade in hand. "We're not here to kill you," he tells the Devil, in a low and sincere voice.

"That's a pity," Lucifer laughs, "'Cause I am."

He waves a hand. Rowena is the first to get thrown out and crash onto the opposite wall.

Crowley tightens his jaw, charging forward, with an angel blade of his own, only to get thrown across the room like a fly blown away by a bat.

Castiel leaps forward, stabbing his angel blade into the man's bare back when Lucifer's attention was still on Crowley. Lucifer lets out an outrageous yell, grabbing Castiel by his neck, forcing him kneel on the floor, choking him while bashing him with ruthless punches.

"What's your plan again, exactly?" the Devil says, the red light in his eyes dimming, but his fists do not slow down or lessen the force. Cas's head is forced in an unnatural posture, lifting helplessly crooked up. His face is nothing but broken flesh and blood. Blue-white grace light starts showing in his open mouth and eyes, and the Devil's grasp is still tightening. "Thank you for not killing me, by the way." His voice is even turning into something gentle now. "Not that you can. But you know what? I have killed you before, like squashing an insect, I'll just have to do it again, properly this time. Dad is not here for you this time."

"NO --" Dean yells, dashing back into the room, throwing himself at Lucifer, without even a gun or blade in his hand.

Lucifer is surprised for a second, to say the least. Perhaps by his idiocy in the moment of heroism. Or perhaps just a moment of distraction.

In any case, that precious little second is all they ever really need.

Dean grabs the Devil's fist that hovers in the air, Castiel grasps the other that's still choking him, and the angel cuff clicks into place.

Lucifer struggles, but all the remnant of red lights in his eyes fade completely. The cuff clings with his moves but doesn't give way. "You gotta be kidding me." He stares at the two before him unbelievably, giving Cas another frustrated kick.

Dean gives the Devil a punch on the head, which finally knocks him out, shutting him up.

Sam and slowly-crawling-up Rowena and Crowley move toward Vince's unconscious body that has a trapped Devil inside. Dean leaves him to them, turning to Cas.

Cas is climbing up slowly, wiping the blood stain away from the corner of his lips. Dean lends him a hand.

He examines his wounded face carefully. Both Cas's eyes are swollen, black and blue all around, barely stay open. The split lips and gashes on the cheeks look terrible. The choking marks on his neck are the worst.

Dean swallows. "How bad is it? Can you heal?"

Cas blinks slowly. Thin grace lights up feebly in his eyes. Dean thinks the swollenness goes down a little bit, but it can also just be his wishful thinking. Not even the bleeding is stopped.

Dean watches him intently. "It's okay if you can't," he says gently, "we can always heal the slow way, you know."

Castiel just frowns deeper, closing his eyes, focusing. The bleeding stops, but only barely. The scabs form where the wounds are, as if he's trying to accelerate the healing process but still can't get it quite there. The circles around his eyes still look quite nasty.

*Exactly how bad was that extraction?* Dean can't help wondering, but he has to push it down. Otherwise he'd keep wondering just how bad *he* has hurt Cas and that would lead to endless sleepless nights.

"Alright, don't tire yourself out." Dean pats him carefully on the shoulder around the farthest edge, hoping that wouldn't cause Cas any extra pain. He forces his voice to sound cheerful. "Let's get home and patch you up the human way. I'm sure you'll back to full strength just in a beat."

Cas only gives him an apologetic, upset look.

Dean helps him up and moves to the car.

Sam and Crowley already finished squeezing an unconscious Vince-slash-Lucifer into the backseat.

"Why isn't him in the trunk?" Dean growls. Now he can't decide if he wants Cas in the front seat or back.

He leads Cas to the passenger side.

"What if he wakes up before we get there?" Sam asks reasonably.

"So? I don't give a rat's ass about how comfortable he is." Dean raises an eyebrow.

Sam sighs. "We still need his help. And he needs to be *willing* to help. The least we can do is not to piss him off more than he already is."

Cas chimes in just in time, not very helpfully, "That would be a very difficult thing to do." He meets the brothers' eyes, then adds, "Considering how angry he already was, and he would very much like to kill all of us as soon as he could. Just saying."

Dean forces a smile. "Good to know. Now can we go?"

Sam moves toward backseat door, while Crowley and Rowena are just about to walk away. Dean points at their backs: "Not so soon."

Crowley grumbles with grudge, "What?! Thought you got your reward already, I didn't even argue for a share. Still can't get a day off?"

Dean takes a breath to make the smile on his face looks slightly more genuine. Then tells them, "We might still need some more of your help."

Crowley snaps grumpily, "What am I, 911?"

Dean looks at Rowena, trying his best smile given the circumstance. Rowena rolls her eyes, limping with her high heels in her hand, and says tiredly, "What he said."

Sam helps out, "Once we're done with him, he's all yours. Revenge or anything, whatever you want."

Dean eyes him from the side, "We are?"

Rowena's lips curl up slightly. "Now we are talking."

Crowley's face also brightens a degree. "Look at you, Moose, you have the potential of being the next best salesman, you know that? I'll keep the position open for you."

"So we good? You coming to bunker together?" Dean raises his voice.

Crowley considers, then, "Not really in mood for slumber party right now, but call me. You know my number." Not waiting for Dean's answer, he turns to the witch, holding out a hand in an inviting gesture, "Mother, shall we?"

The two of them disappear in a black-purple smoke.

Dean blinks at the empty space.

Sam says, "Guess that's as good as we can ask for."

Dean decides he's right, shrugs once, and climbs into the car.

Cas already falls asleep on the passenger seat.

Dean turns the ignition quietly, and heads home.

<br>

#### Act 5

> INT. bunker - day (Dean, Sam, Cas, Lucifer)
>
> Lucifer back in bunker in Vince's vessel, they help Lucifer recover, by looking for a new/repaired vessel for him

Bunker has never before seen more like a hospital inpatient department -- practically everyone living in here could use some medical attention. Including the hostage. For a brief moment, Dean even feels bad for him, watching his passed-out vessel chained to the dungeon -- he almost looks like just a normal guy, that second-tier rock star is probably also still in there suffering big time -- until he remembers all the shitty things the Devil has done to them. To him. To Cas. He then wants nothing more than giving the bastard more punches.

But even without the punches, Lucifer doesn't look so hot. The degrading process is visible and fast, spreading from the skin to deeper underneath, as if watching a piece of fresh meat turning bad in room temperature in speed-up mode. The blackened, necrotic skin fall from his body like winter leaves falling, showing the flesh underneath. Then the flesh shrink as dark spots and sores spreading, like some moth-eaten woods, cankered and charred. After the flesh fall off, that is only the skeleton left standing. Walking and talking. But even the bones are crumbling down, leaving pieces of broken fragments on the floor, falling apart. With that rate, within a few days, they wouldn't have a chained Lucifer in the basement, he'd become a pile of dust plus some pitiful, spinning, vessel-less grace looking for a body.

"I can't believe I'm going to say this, but uh --" Dean says, sitting at the library table, to the other two, "We might have to find a way to help Lucifer recover."

"What?" Sam startles.

"Look at him," Dean points at the dungeon monitor screen, "no way he's 'the brightest light' the way he is now. I say we either patch that rock star vessel or get him another one."

Cas's face hardens. "Which means another soul would get possessed, whoever that may be. Is that what you mean?"

Dean stutters, "I guess."

Cas's eyes bore into his. "And is that what you mean when you specifically ask me and Sam to promise never to say 'Yes' to Lucifer?" He narrows his eyes. "Then it looks like there is only one option left. Dean, are you going to say 'Yes'?"

Sam jumps from his seat. "I'll never let you do that."

Dean raises two hands in the air in surrender. "Not so fast," He stares back at Cas, then shifts to Sam, "No, that's not what I mean, chill, alright?"

He turns the book in front of him for them to see, the pattern on the page looking vaguely familiar. Cas recognizes it first, "It's the Celtic curse Rowena used on Lucifer to accelerate the decay. If we can reverse it, maybe we can keep him steady in Vince Vincente for a while longer, until he recovers enough to help."

Dean looks at him. "Would that work?"

Cas drags that Celtic magic book closer to him, studying the page. He frowns, "I think Rowena made some change. There is no mention of ash of hawthorn tree anywhere, the last part of the curse I overheard is also not standard. She must have learned from the Book of the Damned."

Sam breathes out short, "Then only she would know how to reverse it."

Dean reaches for his phone, "I'll give her a call."

<br>

> INT. bunker/Hell - day (Dean, Sam, Cas, Lucifer, Crowley, Rowena)
>
> phone call to Rowena/Crowley to look for Nick's body but neither give straight answer
>
> Cas is getting more sick, cough

"Miss me so soon?" Rowena's over-sweet voice comes out of the speaker, in the background of some remote indistinct torturing and screaming sound.

"We need the reverse spell for that decay one you used on Lucifer," Sam blunts out.

"Jeez, don't sugar coat it," Dean hisses.

"Why?" Rowena's voice comes louder and clearer. Sound like she walked to a quiet corner of the room.

"We need to help Lucifer recover," Cas supplies.

"Oh, isn't that the sweet wee angel there? Hello, Sunshine." Rowena's sweet voice greets cheerfully. Dean can't help rolling his eyes.

"Rowena," Dean presses, tone more serious, "we need Lucifer to save the world, and he can't do that in that shabby vessel you poisoned."

"Then find him another vessel, problem solved," Rowena says in a tone that sounds completely like "Why is that my problem?"

"That's not helpful at all," Sam hisses between his teeth. Cas nods quietly to agree.

Dean sighs, shutting his eyes. "Not an option, any other brilliant ideas?"

"There is one, if you must --" Rowena says, with the sound of a wry smile at the edge of each syllable, "-- there's always that good old Nick -- what's his last name?"

"Nick?" Dean looks up, meeting Cas and Sam's eyes. "The vessel -- that man -- he possessed like ten years ago?"

"Bingo."

"He's still alive and kicking?"

"No, but three guesses where he ended up now."

Sam breathes out harshly. "Hell."

Rowena laughs pretentiously. "Aren't you the smartest student in the class, Samuel? Have fun shopping vessels, boys."

She hangs up after that.

"Works for me." In Dean's querying eyes, Sam shrugs.

Cas doesn't give much sign of opinions, just moving to sit down in the closest chair, looking like just tired of standing and staring at the phone for too long.

Dean rings the King of Hell next.

Crowley picks at the sixth ring.

"This is Hell," he greets glumly.

"Do you happen to know where Nick's body is?" Dean stares at the "666" on the phone's screen.

"Nick who?" Crowley asks.

"What's his last name?" Dean mouths to Sam silently, who answers with a shaking head.

Dean turns back to phone. "Just Nick, *that* Nick from like ten years ago, the one Lucifer possessed."

"Seven," Sam corrects him. Then speaking to the phone as well, adding, "Heard he's in Hell now, hope he doesn't mind his meat suit get borrowed again."

"Ah, that Nick," Crowley says with a deliberately stretched tone. Dean frowns at the screen.

"Ring a bell. What about him?" the demon carelessly asks.

Dean takes a breath, at the edge of losing temper. "Cut the crap, Crowley, you know exactly why we're asking, and you agreed to help! He's in your department. We're looking for his body right now. Any idea where?"

"No. Must be rotten somewhere all those years ago." Crowley answers plainly. "Dig up the grave if you must, you might find a couple bones from old Nick. No idea why you look for those junk."

"I don't buy it," Dean glares at the screen, wishing he can just grab the demon on his fine suit's collar to let him know how serious they are. His gut is telling him Crowley is lying.

"That's *your* problem then. Have fun hunting some bones, Squirrel." A pause, then, "Say 'Hi' to Feathers to me. Ciao."

The line is cut then.

Dean throws the phone to the middle of the table, wiping his face. "He's lying. He knew exactly where Nick's body is and he's not telling us. Freaking demons!"

"What are we gonna do?" Sam frowns at him. "He could be telling the truth, and we might just waste days and weeks digging empty graves -- if he even had one. Things were quite nasty back then, if you remember."

"Yeah, hard to forget that big swan dive. Thought that was it back then, if Cas didn't bring you back. Speaking of --"

Dean glances at Cas, who's just sitting there quietly, listening to them with a tilted head. If it's not because his eyes are still open, Dean might suspect he has fallen asleep. The scars and bruises on his face are still difficult to look at. The ones on his neck turned from black to purple, like a large circle of bruise scarf. Dean has to force his eyes away from there whenever his eyes land on Cas, and this is one of those moments.

"Someone's been really quiet," Dean pokes him. "You got anything to add to the table, Cas?"

Cas turns to meet his eyes. He opens his mouth, but before he can say anything, he starts coughing. Once. Then a second times. At the third times, Dean's eyebrows arch. "What's that?"

Cas eases his breath and says in a plain tone, "It's nothing. Just, something in my throat." But he's a terrible liar.

"No, it's not." Dean says straight, walking closer to look at him with better lighting. "You got a cold or something?"

His eyes scrutinize up and down the angel's shirt and suit jacket, Cas has taken off his trench coat and left it on the back of the chair.

"Those clothes, too hot? Too cold? Want A/C on? Anything?" Dean asks, tone concerning.

Cas shifts in the seat uneasily. "Temperature does not concern me," he says.

His Adam's apple bobbing up and down, looking nothing other than silently suppressed another round of urge to cough again. Dean does not miss that, the twist in his brows deepens.

"You sure about that? That looks exactly like the cold Sammy used to have every year around fall-winter time."

Sam protests weakly with rolling eyes that mean "I wasn't a sickly kid!" Dean's too distracted to see it.

Cas manages to get his breathes even again, pressing at his temples. "I'm fine. The fight with Lucifer was exhausting, that's all. I think we should focus on looking for Nick and his body as vessel for Lucifer, as soon as possible. Heaven and the Angels there might not withstand much longer, I'm afraid souls might start falling from cracks in Heaven soon."

Dean gives him another look, but decides to let it slip for once. He turns to Sam, shrugging lightly, "You heard Cas. Think it's settled then. How hard can it be to find a guy Lucifer handpicked seven years ago?"

Sam flinches.

Dean is taken aback for a second, whispering a quick "Didn't mean to..." under his breath.

They start the searching and researching just as if it's another run-of-mill case.

<br>

#### Act 6

> INT. bunker library - day (Dean, Sam, Cas)
>
> they research, try to find info about Nick's body but can't find any, decide to go to Detroit again
>
> Cas wants to come too but coughing and staggering and sick, Dean asks him to stay in bunker keeping an eye on Lucifer and research on how to patch degraded bodies and help Lucifer recover

"I can't find anything online," Sam shuts off his laptop, exhausted. "Detroit was in Hell back then, like, literally. No surprise that no one kept record for a mysterious body in a deserted apartment."

"We might have to go back there then, take a look what happened. He might still be there, with any luck." Dean thinks aloud.

"Then he will just be a pile of bones, like Rowena suggested." Cas comments.

Dean pinches the bridge of his nose. "Fixing that body gotta be easier than fixing that rock star's, eh? For one, the Devil isn't in him right this moment. It's like finding him something temporary usable as a substitute."

"I still don't like the idea," Sam sighs, but standing up obediently. "Alright, I'll go packing. Meet you in the garage in ten?"

"I'm coming too," Cas follows him to stand up. But he staggers, almost tripping over a table leg. Dean is quick enough to land him a hand on the shoulder. Cas has to hold on to the table for some support. Dean leads him to sit back down.

"Woah, buddy, I don't think you're going anywhere." Dean watches him closely, worried. "You alright? Is it just the light or you look even worse than two days ago?"

"It's the light," Cas says, breathing heavily, trying to stand up again, regardless of Dean's hand on his shoulder. Dean presses him back down, exchanging a look with Sam.

"You know what, we need someone keep an eye on the Devil too. I don't want to come back and find him on the loose again, or the bunker gets torn apart, or both. Why don't you get some more rest, research on how to patch a body, find some spell we can try later? We'll be back before you know it."

"I can still fight," Cas says stubbornly, not meeting his eyes. "You don't know what you might run into in Detroit." But his body leans into the seat.

"I know you can," Dean gives him a quick pat on the shoulder, trying to pull a small smile. "We just need you in a different battlefield."

"Alright," Cas says finally with a small pout, which Dean finds just too adorable to not stare for a moment longer than necessary.

"Call me if you need anything. I can drive to meet you if you need," Cas says behind them when they head for the garage.

"Of course," Dean answers freely, waving a goodbye.

"Something's up with him." Dean says, as soon as they pull out of the bunker garage and run onto the road, heading east. "He's weak, he's hurt, he couldn't heal himself. Oh, and he needs sleep now -- never a good sign."

"What, you think he's lying to us? Something he didn't tell?" Sam asks. "Like that time you said he was sketchy when Naomi was pulling his strings or he was running around with Crowley?"

"I don't know, man. I just don't know what's happening and I don't like it." Dean frowns at the windshield.

"He did just recently get his grace extracted and reinjected -- it gotta be like a major angel surgery or something, right? And then the whole trip to the Heaven and back, the fight with Lucifer -- It sorta makes sense he's exhausted, don't you think?" Sam says reasonably.

Dean hums quietly, not quite convinced.

"I just wish I know how to help him," he says bitterly.

"I know what you mean," Sam sighs, but doesn't have much to add.

They roll into Detroit in little more than ten hours. The night folds around them. Everything seems far too familiar.

Sam grimaces when the same shabby deserted apartment building comes into view. Dean manages to find it just by his memory -- the part of the memory he wished he had forgotten, but something like that, it probably already branded into his brain cortex.

Dean has to swallow down all the bitter taste on his tongue too when he shuts the engine and steps out.

This part of the town seems completely deserted since the Devil's show seven years ago -- not like it was downtown back in the day either, any way.

Sam breathes heavily when he gets out of the car, stepping onto the uneven ground.

The back street they parked is covered with litters, empty bottles mostly. Dean has to force his brain to not think if those are the exact same ones Sam has to juice up with demon blood from.

This really seems to be the worst plan they've ever made -- worst since Sam said "Yes."

"You okay?" Dean eyes his brother from the back.

Sam's chest heaves and falls violently when he looks up at the apartment window from outside. He bites his lips hard.

"Yeah," he says. "Let's go."

Sam finds the exact room like it's second nature.

It's layered with dust worth of seven years. The window is dark and dirty, but with a clearing that looks like a handwritten Devil's Trident. Dean stares at it for a brief moment, wondering if it's just another Lucifer's bad joke or it might actually have some magic in it.

There are two rotten bodies near the door, but neither of them are Nick. Sam remembers them, the sidekick demons killed by *him*. But now he looks at them, he realizes those were once two men, too. With their bodies decaying into bones and skeletons, and he wonders for the first time where their family might be. But that's not really the most urgent matter on their world-saving todo list.

Dean walks toward the window, wiping the dust on the floor with the tip of his shoes. "He should be here somewhere," he says.

"If no one moved him," Sam murmurs, looking around. "There's sulfur everywhere."

"Of course there's sulfur everywhere, Lucifer was here, remember?" Dean mocks.

"No, I mean no sign of angels then. And if it's human who find him and take him, why would they leave the other two unattended?" Sam reasons.

Dean thinks with his head tilted slightly, impressed. "Nice thinking, Sherlock. So we know it's demons taking him."

"Which means Crowley," Sam sighs.

"I knew it!" Dean grits his teeth, punching the air with frustrated hands. "Dammit, if he dragged Nick's body all those years ago, he could have stashed him anywhere. We might as well dig the whole Hell up and not find a bone from him."

"Dead end, then." Sam agrees.

But right then, their breath start turning into white mist. Room temperature drops so much that the dusty window starts freezing up. Dean reaches for his gun in one hand, EMF in the other. The little detector beep loudly with the pointer reaching the red zone.

"Ghosts," Sam jumps alarmingly, having his gun ready, loading it with salt-loaded bullets.

"How come there are ghosts all of a sudden?" Dean scans the room, whispering. "Not like anyone died here -- oh crap." He glances at the dead demon vessels.

Sam follows his gaze. "Or could be Nick coming back himself? This is probably where he died too."

"Nick?" A woman's voice says faintly. "Nick, where are you?"

Dean exchanges a confused look with Sam.

"Who are you?" Dean raises his voice. "Show yourself!"

The ghost of a woman in white sleeping gown with long brown hair emerges in the air slowly. She looks sad and terrified.

Dean takes a ginger step toward her, gun lowering a few inches, but still in her general direction.

Sam squints at her arms. She folds her arms like a cradle, with a semitransparent ghost of a sleeping infant in there.

"Is that..." Dean widens his eyes. "Is that a baby ghost?"

"Is that even possible?" Sam gapes his mouth too, when he takes a clearer view at the woman and the baby. "Babies can't possible be vengeful or something?"

Dean shoots him a glare, whispering, "Dude, *The Omen*, *Shining*, *Chucky*."

"Yeah, but they're not like babies that are still in cradles! And they're movies, Dean!" Sam hisses back.

The woman looks at them, moving her wide sad eyes from Sam to Dean, as if she only now gets a good look at them. "What is happening? Where is Nick?"

Dean huffs a laugh. "Yeah, lady, exactly our questions, too: 'What's happening' and 'Where's Nick'."

Sam answers, "I'm Sam, this is Dean. We're looking for Nick, too. Who are you?"

"Sarah," the woman answers dreamily, "and this is Teddy. Please tell me what's happening." Her tone is terrified, but nothing hateful or outrageous as they usually seen in vengeful spirits.

Sam exhales slowly, lowering his gun, stepping to her carefully like approaching a scared wild creature. "Sarah, it might be a little difficult to take, but, uh... you are dead, and now a ghost." He exchanges an unnerving look with Dean, waiting.

"I know," Sarah says, much to their surprise. "I remember having to see my husband say 'Yes' to the Devil, right there in our bedroom, and there was nothing I could do to save him. It broke my heart."

Dean blinks rapidly. "You know?"

"Your husband?" Sam says at the same moment, inhaling with realization. "You're Nick's wife, and this is his son," he nods slowly. "I'm sorry."

"How old is your son?" Dean asks.

"Three months," Sarah answers, teary-eyed immediately, looking down at the baby in her arms. The ghost of the three-month baby shine vaguely and peacefully, more like a soul from Heaven than a ghost.

"I'm sorry, but that's not possible," Dean says, bewildered. "Three-month-olds don't usually decide they have unfinished business and stay behind."

"Is your son always a ghost, like you?" Sam asks carefully.

"No, only from yesterday." Sarah looks up at him. "Something must be wrong. I think. The place I was in was suddenly so crowded in the last few days. And he just, suddenly fell to me."

"Heaven's breaking apart." Dean turns to Sam, frowning deep. "Souls from Heaven are falling to the Vail. Cas warned us about it. Even baby souls, god, it's so messed up." He breathes out heavily, lowering his hand with the gun completely.

"Why are you here, Sarah?" Sam asks instead. "It must be five hundred miles away from your home. Ghosts don't usually move around so much."

"Unless the thing or person they're attached to moved." Dean corrects him, forming a theory. "Do you know where your husband is, Sarah?"

Sarah shakes her head apologetically. "The distance in this place -- the Vail? -- it felt different. I don't know where exactly, but I can feel him. He's chained, he's in a lot of pain."

"Sounds like Lucifer now," Sam whispers quickly to Dean, who returns a brief nod.

"But he's on Earth, alive?" Dean takes a step toward Sarah, staring at her.

"Yes," Sarah answers breathlessly. "It's dark, the place he is, but there is a small closed window, high up on the wall, barred. Like a facility." She takes turns looking at them, pleading, "Can you help find him, and save him? I can't move on without knowing he's alright."

"We'll try our best," Sam tells her, but he looks away.

"Is there anything else you noticed, anything to help us find him?" Dean pushes.

Sarah frowns hard, squeezing her eyes, as if she's looking very attentively at something in the Vail. "It's all very vague, it's like I can sense around him, but not clear enough to reach him. I think... the air around him smells salty, I think that's why I can't get to him. I only came here because I sensed the disturbance in the last place he was, and you were speaking his name."

"Salty. That's good," Dean nods, "must be somewhere near the sea then, that's good, we can start from there." He gives Sam a look, head tilting toward the door.

Sam gives Sarah a friendly smile. "Thank you. We'll find him. Try get some peace," he tells her, though still can't quite look her in the eyes.

They leave the apartment.

And soon, out of Detroit.

"Abandoned facility. Somewhere near the sea." Sam says as he types into the laptop on the passenger seat.

"She's not Jessica, you know," Dean blurts out.

"What?" Sam startles, staring at him. "Of course not, I know that."

"Good," Dean has his eyes trained pointedly at the road before them, voice a little strained. "I saw the way you talk to her. Just thought to remind you that."

"Right, yeah." Sam turns back to his laptop, face carefully controlled, rapidly typing and scrolling the page for a few minutes. Then, suddenly lifts his head again, "I wasn't guilty because she reminds me of Jess, Dean. It's because she doesn't know Nick's already in Hell. They'll never reunite again. And we're not really there helping either of them, we just want Nick's *body* for Christ's sake. We're no better than what Lucifer did to them."

"We're trying to save the world here!" Dean snaps, clenching the wheel far too tight. The car shifts on the road unsteadily. "Lucifer ruined their lives, Nick said 'Yes' -- We didn't do any of that! In fact, once we're done with this crap in Heaven, stop the souls from falling from there, we'll send her to peace too. Now will you please focus on the case and find where Crowley stashed the body?"

Sam sighs defeatedly, stopping the arguing.

Dean fumbles his phone and dials a number from the speed-dial.

The phone rings until it goes to the voicemail.

Dean glances down at the screen with a frown, then talking to it: "Cas, you alright? We have some leads about where Nick's body might be, could use some help locating the exact place. Call me when you can."

Sam doesn't look up. "Cas not answering?"

"Yeah, must be sleeping or something. That's good, he could use some rest." Dean checks his watch. It's indeed quite late, now that he thinks about that. They've been practically driving the whole day and then just ran straight into that ghost show. His nerve is cracking with exhaustion now that adrenaline starts dropping.

"So could we," Sam says exactly what he has in mind.

They pull over at the first motel out of the town.

<br>

#### Act 7

> INT. bunker dungeon - night (Cas, Lucifer)
>
> Cas/Lucifer talk, mention Heaven, mention last year, Lucifer knows Cas's condition, taunts his feeling for Dean

Cas sits at the bunker library, hands pressing on his head as hard as he can, eyes closed with a frown. The pounding and pulsing inside his head is getting worse, though it does make the screening in the angel radio sound quieter. But it could also mean there might not be many angels left to save now, that they might already be too slow, too late. He tries not to think about that, or he's afraid he won't be able to control himself to go there and take a look again. Dean would be pissed if he found him leaving bunker again when he comes back. That much he can be sure.

Cas idly flips the book before him. It's a book about spells that supposedly help the spellcaster remain young and beautiful for as long as you want -- used by female spellcasters, mostly, as it seems. But most of the spells require a regular consumption of blood or heart of young girls without sexual experience. His attention drifts shortly, but his fingers continue the motion.

The monitor screen for the dungeon sits on the table in front of the book. Cas throws a glance at it every now and then. He can't bare to look at the Devil for too long though. Lucifer has waken up, but the angel cuff has made sure he can't do much other than wandering around, and the dungeon chains make sure he can't wander for more than two steps.

They have removed the table and chair from the dungeon, leaving it as bare as the Earth before Creation -- "Don't want him get creative," Dean had said before they left.

So now Lucifer just lies on the floor, staring at the dungeon ceiling.

Cas tries to read a few more lines on the book.

"Castiel --" Lucifer starts calling him in a raspy singing tone.

Cas glares at him through the screen, decidedly ignoring him. Dean had said not to interact with Lucifer too, not that he would want for any reason.

"Castiel ~ I know you are there ~ I know you can hear me ~ " Lucifer is relentlessly annoying.

Cas covers his ears, shutting his eyes.

"You know you don't need those to hear me, right?" Lucifer says through the angelic wavelength, as if he sees exactly what he was doing. The Devil's grating voice directly sound up in his head, sawing it off in two halves.

Castiel stomps to the dungeon. "What do you want."

"There you are, buddy. Finally." Lucifer sits up from the floor, grinning at him. "About time."

The vessel he's in has no skin and barely much flesh left now. When he smiles, it's a skull's smile with teeth and bones. But in Cas's eyes, he can still see the Devil's face behind that body -- weak and low energy he may be, they both are, the Devil's true face is still horrifying. Even more so with the skeleton overlay.

Cas trains his gaze on the floor, a step before him.

"Look, buddy, I'm dying, you're dying. Can't we have some death bed kind words, eh? Some heart-to-heart, like our good old days last year?" Lucifer opens his palms, in a gesture that would usually mean warm and welcome and peace-making offer.

Cas growls, "We're not buddy, and you're not dying. Nor am I."

"Okay yes, you're right. I'm not dying. Who am I? I'm Lucifer. You can't kill me like that. But nice trying." Lucifer says rapidly, dropping the pretense of being all sick and pitiful. "But you, my friend, on the other hand, are actually dying, don't tell me you haven't figured that out yet?"

Castiel doesn't answer. A sudden bout of coughing rises in his chest, sharp and fierce. He has to stand very still, gripping the doorframe for support, and holding his breath to keep it down.

Lucifer squints at him. "What did I just say?" He mouths a "Dying" exaggeratedly.

"This changes nothing," Cas answers gloomily. "And you won't say anything to Dean and Sam."

Lucifer widens his eyes with surprise like he just opened his Christmas gift. "Oh my Dad! They don't know! You know what I like most about you? You're like me. It's all about keeping big secrets and working on your own. Independence is underrated in marriage nowadays. Am I right? Like that relationship of yours with Dean Winchester... tut tut -- why aren't you married yet?"

Cas turns to shut the dungeon gate, not saying a word.

"Wait, wait!" Lucifer yells. "Don't go so fast. Look at you, touchy touchy. I'm just trying to give some friendly advice, you know, sometimes only an outsider can see the most clearly. You don't want him find out only when you're a corpse, do you?"

"It won't happen if you can do your part," Cas says glumly.

"And what's that exactly? Think I missed my debrief." Lucifer raises one side of his eyebrows -- the browbone that would have held eyebrow, to be exact.

Cas bites his tongue. "We'll talk about it later, when they are here." He starts closing the heavily hidden door again.

"Cas, Cas, come on! Don't be like that! Give me something. Anything! No?" Lucifer whines loudly.

Castiel can still hear him shouting alone when the door is fully closed. "You're the worst! You know that, Castiel? I should have just killed you. In fact, I should have just let Amara infect you, like it did to everyone else!"

Cas stops dead on his way back up.

It could be a trick. He looks up at the ceiling, thinking to himself. Dean had warned him Lucifer is full of tricks, and he has witnessed enough with his own eyes.

Cas fumbles his pocket, thinking maybe he should give Dean a call first. He realizes he left his phone upstairs.

"What did you say?" The heavy door is pulled open again.

Lucifer beams brightly at him with a mouth without lips. "Now we are talking. First thing first, do you have one of those nice little cozy chairs I can sit on?"

<br>

#### Act 8

> EXT. Fall River, Massachusetts - day (Dean, Sam)
>
> Dean/Sam in their way looking for Crowley's throne room. Dean worry about Cas, want to go back to him, decide to stay to help out Sam eventually
>
> (first important hint: first time show Dean has to choose between Sam/Cas, even though he worry about Cas, he does choose Sam over Cas, even for good reason, not explicitly highlighting or pointing out by anyone, just showing it as fact)

Sam has narrowed the locations down to a few sites near the shore around Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where there have been demonic sightings recently. He has written them down into a notepad.

They have to appreciate there aren't that many deserted hospital facilities around the area -- at least not as many as deserted factories. That's still a list of a dozen locations which probably will take them at least a day or two, even if they split -- which, "Still sound like a terrible idea," says Dean.

"Are you so restless because you're worried we can't find Nick, or because Cas isn't answering your phone?" Sam asks, from the other end of the phone.

Dean stares at the road ahead of him, with the sea gulls fighting for something in the middle of the road which is causing a huge traffic jam -- freaking big cities with so many people living in it.

"He hasn't replied any message or picked up any of the call since yesterday." Dean tries not to sound like a clingy partner but fails gloriously. "It's not okay. He's not well, and there's Lucifer in the bunker. I should never have left them there."

"He's an adult, an angel, he can --" Sam sighs, cutting himself off. "Forget it, what are you gonna do?"

"Thinking about going back home," Dean answers quickly.

"That's a twenty-six hour drive," Sam points out reasonably. "You wouldn't be there until tomorrow afternoon and you can't drive all the time without rest. How far down the list are you now?"

"Half way through, on my way to Fall River," Dean glances at the scribbled note. "But I'm stuck in Boston now. Traffic is Hell."

"Hell is Hell, Dean," Sam says in his Sam-branded patient soothing voice. "What about you check that one out, then go home, I can take the rest."

Dean is quite for a moment, then asks, "You sure about that?"

"Not really, I need you here. You know, demons can get nasty. But I get it." Sam sighs again tiredly. "If you think Cas needs you more, then go. It's your call. Gotta make sure he's okay, right?"

Dean considers for a minute, then gives way with a sigh. "You know what, you're right, we should finish this first. It's gonna be a long-ass drive, I'll need my switch driver and you'll need backup if we do find Crowley's hideout. Might as well stick to the plan and we can both go home early."

Sam huffs a small relieved breath. "Sounds good to me."

Dean shifts his attention back to the road and the task in hand, but he finds it so difficult to keep his mind from wandering back to bunker from time to time.

<br>

> INT. Needham Asylum - Fall River, Massachusetts (Dean, Sam, Crowley, Nick's body)
>
> Dean/Sam find Crowley's throne room and Nick's body, bring Nick's body back to bunker with an unknown demon (actually Nick) inside

Dean knows this is the right place when he drives to it. Spooky decommissioned asylum, fancy gothic style pointed-top architecture, wandering black-eyed demons patrolling around.

He sends a quick message: "Needham Asylum." And goes in there quietly alone.

The place is like a ghost house in those classic horror movies from outside, but the inside, surprisingly, is like a neat office building. Black-suits hurry their way from one office to another, with clipboards and printed something in their hands -- he wouldn't have known they're demons if not for their black eyes.

Dean supposes he might should have thought about Crowley's preferred style of running things, knowing his fancy little suit and cocktail and everything. He walks down the corridor with a sign that points to the principal doctor's office.

Two demons at the door try to stop him from entering, ended up smoking on the floor, each with an angel blade-shaped hole on their chests. He pushes the door open. Crowley sits on his throne, legs crossed, is listening to a black-suit reporting something about the statistics of crossroad deal numbers and qualities. He gets the rest of the demons out of the room at the sight of Dean, uncrossing his legs.

"Squirrel! I didn't hear the door bell! You should have sent a card in advance." Crowley says cheerfully, pitch higher than usual.

"You hung up on me last time. Figured I'd have to make it formal." Dean deadpans, spinning the blade in his fingers.

Crowley eyes it warily. "How did you find me? And where are Moose and Feathers?"

"Took us some effort, but you didn't hide as well as you think." Dean answers flatly. "So we're having small talks now? Why don't you give me a tour around here and point me to where you stashed Nick's body?"

Crowley regards him for a second, then walks down from the throne with a bright smile. "Sure, no problem. This way."

Dean stares at the back of his head watchfully. "What, just like that?"

"Just like that," Crowley says, pushing open the wall covered by the bookshelf, which spins open to reveal a hidden chamber. "What can I say, I'm a nice person."

Dean snorts once, following him inside, two steps behind.

He knows immediately this must be the chamber that Sarah ghost lady sensed from all those miles away. The air is damp and salty, smelling of must and mold. A dirty, tiny window sits near the high ceiling, letting some faint light in. In the middle of the room, on a metal chair, chains the body of Nick. Iron chains tie his hands and feet to the floor, another one winding around his neck like a leash.

The body is well preserved, as it seems. All the flesh and blood look as healthy and complete as when the human was still alive, no sign of degrading from being dead for seven years. Dean takes a step closer, noticing the body is not just lying there lifelessly. His chest rises and falls as if the man is just deep in sleep or coma.

"What's this, your kinky personal project?" Dean turns to stare at Crowley. "Is the guy still alive?"

"I wouldn't go that far to call it 'alive'." Crowley walks around the chained body, examining it carefully, smiling pleasantly. "Just got a demon inside. Keeps the body fresh. Otherwise it's just a pile of dead meat, it smells after three days. You have no idea how long it took to get everything done."

"What everything?" Dean's eyes follow Crowley's move, shifting between the demon and the body.

Crowley looks up at him, proud. "I learned a thing or two from the witch. Finally figured out how to decode most of the Cage's lock magic and runes, and have them all transferred to this body, carved into every bone, every blood, every molecule of every cell. The Devil can live in that body just like he did in the Cage, but he's gonna be my little bitch." He grits his teeth satisfyingly as if he's already imagining chewing the Devil between them.

Realization dawns on Dean. "So that's your plan when we ran into you and Rowena in LA. You were about to cast him into this body and have your little moment of revenge."

Crowley shrugs, then glares at him with grudge. "Then you lot just *had to* show up and ruin the day for us, didn't you? Mother and I had him under control."

"You and Rowena would be dead if we weren't there!" Dean protests.

"We were almost dead *because of* you!" Crowley growls.

"Alright, why don't we all calm down and take a step back? No one's blaming anyone." Sam arrives right on time. Dean doesn't even hear him coming, figuring must be their voices pointing him where to look.

"Moose," Crowley squints at him, "Aren't you always the peacemaker? I was just trying to tell your brother how helpful I was!"

"Yes you were, and we are grateful for that. Now would you mind do us another favor of loaning Nick's body? We want the same thing here, anyway, right? Lucifer in that body, and you got the controller, I assume?" Sam says smoothly. "We'll need to borrow the remote too, if you don't mind."

Crowley seems to be pleased, smiling like a cat tasting butter. "You promised to give him back, right? I have a buck load of things I'd like to try there, start with hopping on one feet and dancing with one hand touching his nose."

Dean rolls his eyes impatiently. "Yes, you can have all the fun once we're done with him. Now, the body, please? We don't have all day here."

They load Nick's body into the trunk of the impala, hidden inside a sackbag as if it's just a large bag of potato. The demon inside stays in there, part of the buy-one-get-one-for-free deal, as Crowley says. With the iron chains still wrapped around the body and the demon-proof sigil in the trunk, the demon can't get anywhere anyway. And with all the spell work and runes, the demon doesn't wake up however rough they haul and drag the body. Dean thinks it's fine then, they can handle a punch-the-clock demon even if he gets inside the bunker and gets loose.

They leave Crowley's place hastily.

<br>

#### Act 9

> INT. bunker - night (Dean, Sam, Cas, Lucifer, Nick)
>
> Dean/Sam get back to bunker, find Cas super sick in the dungeon with Lucifer, Dean helps Cas get rested first
>
> they get Lucifer into Nick

Dean calls Cas's name the minute he's back in the bunker.

It was a long drive, just like Sam said and he also knew. It took them a whole day driving from Massachusetts to Kansas -- that's the only time Dean thinks flight might does have a reason to exist in US. And Cas still hasn't answered any of his calls or texts in that whole twenty-four hours of drive.

He races into the bunker library first, where they have last seen Cas. And finds Cas's phone on the table next to an open book. All thirty-something unanswered phone calls and text messages on the screen.

Sam gasps at the dungeon monitor, yelling, "Dean! The dungeon!"

Dean doesn't need him say a second time to rush into the lower level.

The dungeon's door is wide open. Dean sees it before getting there, the two immediate worst-scenario thoughts popping into his mind are: Lucifer has escaped, and Cas was hurt again.

He dashes inside without thinking.

Lucifer sits comfortably in a chair -- as comfortable as a skeleton that his vessel now is can still feel, watching with full interest at the shaky figure kneeling on the floor six feet away from him, coughing and choking like breathing is the most impossible thing to do in the world.

"What did you do to him, you son of a bitch?!" Dean roars at Lucifer, running to Cas, kneeling beside him to see how bad it is.

Cas has one hand on the floor holding himself, the other hand covering his mouth, coughing blood. His palm and corner of his mouth are dripping with blood.

"What did I do? Nothing!" The Devil protests loudly and innocently. "Why does something break and everyone always just blame me?"

"Let's get you outta here first," Dean ignores him, helping Cas on his foot.

Cas staggers, Dean slings his arm around his shoulder and holds his waist, taking him to his room. He seems to get a lot better just as they move away from the Devil. And when he settles down on the bed, his coughing has stopped. Though his face is still pale. And the moment Cas is able to start talking again, the first sentence comes out is: "I'm sorry, Dean --"

Dean shushes him gently, using his sleeve to clean up the blood at his lips. "Shhh -- save your strength, Cas. We'll take care of Lucifer. He'll pay for whatever he did to you. Why don't you just take some rest first, and we'll talk later?"

Cas looks like he can't agree more. His breath is still labored, his eyelids seem too heavy to keep open.

Dean regards him studiously, putting a hand on his forehead as if testing his body temperature. He can't help telling him, "Remember I said I used to take care of Sammy when he was a sickish child? I'd sit by his bed all night just to check if he's still breathing every two minutes 'cause I'd be too worried. I couldn't have a full night's sleep until he was bouncing back."

He looks at the angel's closed eyes, and the dark tired circles around them, the old bruises that are still not fully recovered. His fingers ghosting on those trails on his cheeks, Dean whispers, worried to his bones, "Cas, please tell me you'll be fine. Everything is going to be okay."

"It's going to be okay," Cas mumbles sleepily with closed eyes, looks like already half-way falling asleep, but Dean catches it.

Dean sighs a small sigh, hesitating by his bed, and eventually turning off the bedside lamp. *Please be okay.* He stands in the darkness for a minute silently, watching the light from the corridor casting a thin layer of light on Cas's figure. The angel looks peaceful from this angle, the dim silver light is almost like halo, for a moment Dean can imagine him not wounded or weak, just an angel lying peacefully on the bed. Dean lets his breath out slowly and quietly, and closes his door.

He goes back to the dungeon right away. Sam's already there, with Nick's body left outside the dungeon door, barely out of Devil's view.

Lucifer is sniffing the air like a freaking dog. "Sam, buddy, haven't seen you for a while. Miss our roomie days? And what's that out there, don't tell me -- a gift! That's so very considerate of you to bring me some gift, I should prepare something for you too, let me see..." He shakes the cuffed hands, snapping his fingers. Sam is visibly startled just by the sound and motion of that. But nothing happened.

Lucifer frowns at the cuff, annoyed and disappointed. "Whatever, I'll get you a new one once I get out, don't say 'No,' Sam. 'Cause you know what? I always get out." He winks at Sam.

"No, you're not." Dean stomps in. "You're right, we were preparing you something nice and beautiful, but you can forget all about that for whatever you did to Cas, you son of a bitch!" He lurches forward, ready to beat Lucifer again.

"Wait, wait!" Lucifer circles around to separate himself from Dean with the chair in between. "I swear to Dad, I didn't do anything to him! He did everything to himself! Why does no one ever listen to me? In case you didn't notice, I never lie!"

"What do you mean 'He did to himself'?" Dean asks outrageously, not believing a word coming out of the Devil's mouth.

Lucifer shrugs. "Why don't you go ask him yourself -- oh I forgot, *he*'s the one who lies a lot. Just like what I told him, not healthy for relationships --"

"Okay, enough." Dean's fist lands on Lucifer's face.

"Ouch!" Lucifer grimaces. At the same time, Dean holds his own bleeding knuckles close to him, hissing and cursing. Bloody thing is now practically a skeleton, he completely forgot how hard bones are.

The now-twisted and broken nose bone on Lucifer's face makes him looks like a bad-quality medical specimen. And quickly, those broken bones give up connecting to each other or connecting to the rest of the skull, they fall off to the floor. Followed by the cheek bones, then jaw bones.

Piece by piece, like a Domino, what's left of the body of Vince Vincente is disintegrating before their eyes like an avalanche.

This is a bit out of course even for them. Dean and Sam are stunned, just staring. Even Lucifer seems to be surprised, letting out a small annoyed sound of a tut, raising his hands in front of his eyes to observe, only to see the finger bones drop off the floor like cracked tree branches, followed by the palm. The handcuffs drop free from the end of the empty waist.

"Hurry! Nick's body!" Sam snaps out of it first, racing outside the dungeon door.

Dean follows him closely. The two of them carry Nick's body inside, placing in front of the discomposing Devil's old vessel. They take a step back, waiting.

Lucifer's skeleton body stumbles toward this new, whole and complete vessel as if trying to moving inside there, but the moment he moves, the leg bones are crushing down too. He drops to his knees, then there's nothing to hold straight. All the bones scatter on the floor like exposed remains of those who die in the wild and chewed by vultures and coyotes. Bright grace light burst out of the ruins of the body, circling little beneath the dungeon ceiling, like a cloud made of bright light.

Dean and Sam have to narrow their eyes in the light, feeling their eyes stung by the brightness.

The demon inside Nick's body is waken up. He jumps to his feet, looking up at the ceiling, covering his eyes. He says, with the very familiar, exact same tone and voice of Nick, "Holy, it really is you! I never thought I'd ever see you again!"

Dean jumps, prompting, "Nick? I mean, the original Nick?"

Nick turns to them, just as surprised, "Dean? Sam?"

"Holy crap, he's the original Nick," Sam breathes heavily.

"How's that even possible? Get the whole complete set, inside out?"

"Sorta make sense, I guess? His soul must be corrupted in the Hell and became a demon. Then when Crowley invited him back into his old body, he must be happy to do so. So now here we are."

"We gotta have some better definition of what's 'sense'." Dean yells, turning back to the Lucifer-light. So does Sam and Nick.

Lucifer-light coils and recoils in the air like a circling vulture, statics crackling and buzzing in a high tune. Nick rises his arms, opening toward the light. "Yes," he says with an awed voice. "Yes, Lucifer. Come in me. Fill me up. Make me complete again."

"That's just sick," Dean can't help commenting.

Sam gives him a look. "He's a demon, what do you expect?"

Lucifer, without hesitation, pours into Nick's body through his opened mouth. The demon's eyes are rid of the pupil-less blackness, turning into burning white.

A loud thunderous sound rumbles the place. Lightnings shine from the thin air. Dean and Sam barely manage to have their eyes open, watching as Lucifer settling comfortably inside Nick, stretching his shoulders. Enormous, complete wings in its full span cast grand black shadow on the wall behind him.

Lucifer sighs contentedly. "Now we are talking."

He turns to Sam and Dean with a bright smile, and snaps his fingers.

But nothing happens.

Lucifer blinks confusedly, snaps again.

Still nothing happens.

He looks awkwardly at his fingers. "Give it a second. Must be warming up."

"Right," Sam says coldly, snapping *his* fingers. And the grace-light in Lucifer's surrounding and his eyes recede. The shadow of the wings disappear.

"What?! HOW!" Lucifer yells petulantly.

Dean grins slightly. "You got one thing wrong, Luci," he tells the Devil sweetly. "You don't get out. You just jump from one cage to another."

Sam smirks. "Crowley said 'Hi!'"

<br>

#### Act 10

> flashback: INT. Needham Asylum - Fall River, Massachusetts (Dean, Sam, Crowley, Nick)
>
> Crowley explains to them the whole controlling Lucifer through the Cage spell thing, transfer the control temporarily from himself to Sam
>
> INT. bunker dungeon - continuous (Dean, Sam, Lucifer)

"We want the same thing here. Lucifer in that body, and you got the controller, I assume?" Sam was saying to Crowley, back when they were in that Asylum, standing in front of Nick. "We'll need to borrow the remote too, if you don't mind."

"What do you think the control *is*, Moose? A TV remote?" Crowley mocked.

Dean and Sam glared at him with the same blank looks.

Crowley let out an impatient sound. "The control is not a *thing* you can carry around or borrow. It's *me*! *I* get a direct link to this body, this new cage -- tuning the lights up and down, I say go left he can't go right. The Devil is going to be just a puppet once he's inside that body."

"Then come with us!" Dean said, "Tell the Devil what to do, isn't that what you wanted?"

Crowley looked uneasy. "Happy to, but did you lot forget all the demon-proof sigils everywhere in that place? You might as well burn me alive then ask me walk into that damned place. The bloody floor is worse than walking on the summer beach on bare feet! Why do you think I never visited?"

Dean shrugged. He did forget bunker was the safest place on Earth, supposedly anyway -- looks like it's still true, to some extent. "Do I look like I care?"

Crowley sighed, resigned. He snapped his finger. "There, now Moose can act as my proxy. My agent on field. Happy?"

Sam narrowed his eyes. "What did you do?"

"Everything you want and more. Now get out of my place and have fun with the Devil." Crowley walked back to his throne room, heading to the corner cabinet to pour wine.

"I don't feel anything." On their way home, Sam had said, frowning. "Do you think Crowley told us the truth? We now have the control over Lucifer?"

Dean glanced at him, shrugging. "I don't know. Depend on how much you trust Crowley, I guess -- but he was doing okay recently, all things considered. He wanted Lucifer suffer as much as we do, so yeah, I think it should be a good bet -- as good as we can have, anyway."

"Or Lucifer gets a free new body, and we are screwed. No pressure, right?" Sam breathed out heavily.

But as it turns out, Crowley did give them the real deal -- the Cage-bound body, the perfectly easy-to-use control. The whole set.

"Sit," Sam commands, pointing at the chair in the dungeon.

Lucifer's face twitches, teeth gritting, eyes murdering, but his legs, walk toward the chair and sit down just as he's told.

"Kneel," Sam says again. The lines on his face are smoothed, Dean thinks he's never seen Sam so relieved.

"Kinky," Lucifer says jokingly, trying to hold his arms to the chair, but his body moves forward, knees bending. He kneels before them, looking up with narrowed eyes. "Okay, I get it, now you're going to enjoy a moment of power --"

"Shut up," Sam commands with a sharp voice.

Lucifer shuts his mouth instantly, half the sentence cut short.

Sam smiles small, satisfied. Dean huffs, amused, "We should have that earlier."

They leave the dungeon shortly.

"That went so much better than I thought." Dean grins slightly, the moment they're sure they're out of the Devil's ear range, just in case his freaky archangel ability can still hear across the wall. "Why didn't we have that earlier?"

Sam hums, agreeing.

Dean eyes him. "How do you feel? Controlling the Devil? That doesn't have any... I don't know, side effect? Fine prints?"

"No," Sam says, thinking for a second. "It feels amazing. I mean, I've never thought about it's even possible. But that thing back there, telling him to shut up and he has to obey? Yeah, the best thing I've felt since ten years ago -- I wasn't afraid of him anymore."

"Okay, great." Dean exhales in relief. "But just to be safe, let's not use that too often, maybe? We still don't know how Crowley did it, just in case something bite our ass again. Oh, and... don't forget the book said he has to *willingly* give up his 'light' to save all the angels. We still have to figure that out. You can't really force a self-sacrifice."

"Doesn't sound too difficult now, with what we have," Sam says easily.

Dean gives him a nod. "We'll figure that out later. I need to check on Cas now."

<br>

> INT. Cas's room - continuous (Dean, Cas)
>
> INT. library - next morning (Dean, Cas, Sam, Lucifer)
>
> Dean takes care of Cas over the night.
>
> TFW discuss how to help Lucifer strengthen up, whether to get Michael out, have argument. Dean strongly against it. They get phone call from Jody about Bobby
>
> (Lucifer suggest get Michael but they initially refuse, Lucifer being a really annoying childish asshole)

Cas is asleep, by the time Dean's back to his room. He breathes quietly, the rhythm of sea's wave patting on the shore sand. Long and deep.

Dean smiles small at the sound of that.

There is an armchair next to the wall in his room. Dean settles down there, shifting slightly to find a comfortable spot.

He closes his eyes, listening to that rhythm, thinking this is a long day. And tomorrow will be better. It has to.

He wakes up finding himself on the bed, all clothes on but the boots are off. The room is still vaguely dim without a window. But the freshness in his head tells him it's been a full and nice long night's sleep. Something he doesn't usually find when waking up.

Dean sits up slowly. Remembering this isn't his room.

Cas shifts on the armchair next to the bed, the one he planned to spend the night on, reading a book.

"Hello, Dean." Cas looks up, closing his book and leaving it on the bedstand.

"You're up early." Dean looks him up and down.

Cas has his suits and trench coat on now, all nice and clean. No sign of blood or sickness in his look. As if the way he looks yesterday was just a bad dream of Dean's.

"It's actually not so early now," Cas tells him gently. "The Sun has been up for a few hours."

Dean gets off the bed. "How you feel? You look awful yesterday."

"A lot better now," Cas says, tilting his head, looking somewhere left of Dean.

"What did Lucifer do?" Dean prompts, studying him.

"Something dark, I suppose. I don't really know." Cas says thoughtfully. Not offering much.

"He said it's not him, he didn't do anything." Dean doesn't know why he said that. It's not like he's trusting Devil's words over Cas's.

"And you believed that?" Cas narrows his eyes.

Dean shrugs. "Of course not."

"How's the search on Nick's body?" Cas stands up from the chair -- not staggering this time -- smoothens the skirt of the coat, heading to the door.

"Better than I thought, actually." From there, Dean tells him everything he missed from those tons of messages and unanswered calls.

"I'm sorry," Cas says, when he finished talking.

Dean raises an eyebrow, "What for?"

"Making you worried," Cas lowers his eyes again. "As you can see, I'm fine."

Dean smiles a little, nodding.

"But now we really need to start working on saving the angels and the Heaven, if you don't mind." Cas says, gesturing upward, pointing at the ceiling as they walk out of the room, down the hallway toward to the library. "We have wasted a lot of time -- because of me. It's getting worse by every minute."

"How bad?" Dean asks, following him.

"The sound of it is like earthquakes on Earth, but for Heaven, the shaking is making the whole celestial dimension crack. There are rifts that souls are falling from. You might find more ghost or spirit cases shortly, similar to Nick's wife and son." Cas says, voice low.

Sam greets them in the library, in the middle of scrolling on the laptop pages, noting something down on a piece of paper. A handful of their spare phones lie around on the desk, busy buzzing with incoming calls and messages.

"What's that?" Dean glances at the paper he's working on. It has a long list of locations and it's still growing.

"I think the Vail is going nuts," Sam says, wiping his face with the free hand.

"Define 'nuts'," Dean says, though he already has some idea.

"Basically, we have more ghost stories in the last twenty-four hours than the past ten years altogether. I got hunters calling from everywhere saying there are more ghosts than they've ever seen, but they're not vengeful, they're just... there. Confused, just like we're, like they don't belong there, and they have no idea why they're here." Sam hands them the list. "I was trying to see if any of them are real vengeful spirit cases that need attention."

Dean notices Sioux Falls, South Dakota is on the list.

"It's happening," Cas tells him what he just told Dean, the breaking and creaking of Heaven. "We have to act quickly now. If Heaven is left unattended for too long, it won't just be cracks."

"I'll go get Lucifer," Sam volunteers. Dean doesn't stop him.

<br>

Lucifer wanders into the library, following Sam like a dog on a leash. His head lowered, his look sheepish. The delusion of obedience can almost fool anyone who doesn't know him. But the hunters and the angel in the room know better than be deceived.

He opens his mouth, stretching his tongue, but no sound comes out. That "shut up" command is such a charm, they should have that always on default setting.

"Okay, where are we?" Dean takes a step toward the Devil, just so he could stand right in front of Cas. "Right, got a bit catch-up to do."

They tell the Devil the Angel Black Death and the crisis in Heaven, the falling souls into the Vail, and that they need Lucifer with his brightest light.

"You may talk now," Sam commands.

Lucifer exercises his mouth exaggeratedly. "Guys, I'm so glad to be your first choice here." He smiles, almost as if genuinely. He looks them from one to another, eyes lingering on Cas for an extra moment, then turns back to Dean. "Guys, I would love to help, I really do."

"No one's stopping you," Dean snaps.

Lucifer holds two palms up, a look of helplessness. "But look, I'm weakened. Amara, the cuff, and Sam! I like the kinks, but this is just -- too kinky even for me." He touches his throat, gesturing at his grace. "I was the brightest light for millions of years, even in the Cage -- the Morningstar and everything. But just unfortunately not tonight. What's the word? Bad timing --"

"How do we juice you up?" Dean swallows, asking dryly.

"Let me see," Lucifer starts counting fingers with a wide smile, "a few million souls -- I don't mind from where, Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, you guys know the way; my sword -- haven't seen it for years, missed it so much, but it would work so nicely --"

"What's it like? Your sword?" Dean asks.

"You know, strong, big, long. I can ride along. And best of all -- it's not very far or very difficult to find." Lucifer curls his lips, eyes shifting to Sam, wiggling his eyebrows.

"Me." Sam takes a sharp breath.

"You can go to Hell," Dean snaps at Lucifer, landing a hand on Sam's shoulder, pulling him farther away from the Devil.

"Been there, done that. Not a fan," the Devil answers flatly.

"Dean -- we are not seriously talking about 'how to make Lucifer powerful again', are we?" Cas warns with a low voice.

"Yeah, Dean -- are we?" Lucifer mimics his tone. Cas shoots him a glare.

"Unfortunately, we are." Dean turns slightly to Cas, talking to him low and rapidly. "As much as I hate it, it might be the only way."

"Maybe not," Sam says beside them. "There is another." He gives Dean and Cas a look.

Lucifer squints at them, "What, Michael? You're talking about *Michael*? My douchebag brother Michael who's rotting in the Cage, drooling and touching himself everyday? And you think *he* has brighter light than *me*? Please." He looks insulted.

Dean tilts his head in Lucifer's direction, talking to Sam, "He's not wrong."

But Cas says, low and urgent, "Is he? Say Lucifer is only half his light, and with the affect of Cage, Michael must also be weakened, which makes him probably half his light too -- we may actually need both of them. The angel infection comes from Darkness, we would have needed God to cure it --"

"No, we are not getting Michael out of Cage. Out of question. Not until we know we really run out of options!" Dean tells them firmly, his fingers fidgeting the skirt of his flannel. "Am I the only one didn't forget the last time those two are in the same room? That didn't work so well!"

"You're afraid," Lucifer laughs suddenly with realization. "You are afraid Michael would jump your skin the moment he's out. Had to say, learn from your brother, Dean. Sam doesn't have any issue walking around me."

"Shut up," Dean glares at him outrageously, then turns to Sam. "Tell him to shut the fuck up!" Then back to both of them, "Come on, it's like putting two nuclear together and hope they don't explode! What's the odds?"

Lucifer makes a thinking face, "Actually, you know what, on second thought, I like your idea -- get Mikey out, we'll have some brother moment, and vola, put the big showdown back on track, you know, the one you derailed? I missed that. What do you say?"

Sam looks from Lucifer to Dean. "I thought that's part of the idea, the two of them go blown up together, their explosion lights purify the Heaven and angels."

"And take half the planet with it? I didn't know that's part of any plan!" Dean retorts harshly. "I was thinking more like a nuclear power plant, not a freaking Apocalypse round two!"

Cas says, frowning deep, "But we may not have enough time for him *or Michael* to recover properly. It's already happening. We're running out of time." He nods at the ghost-sighting list Sam was putting together earlier.

"Then we'd better hurry up figuring out where to find some sorry-ass doomed souls for him to chew on." Dean points a finger at the Devil without looking.

"I still think you're afraid of Michael. You can't hide from him forever --" Lucifer comments observantly with a dragging voice.

"You shut up," Sam points at him. And the Devil is muted. Dean gives him an appreciated look.

"Alright, enough talking and more working! End of discussion!" Dean claps decidedly, pressing his hands on the desk.

Sam takes the cue to bring Lucifer back to the dungeon.

Cas takes a step closer to Dean while they're gone, standing merely inches away, studying his face that suddenly sags down exhaustedly with a hard mask down. "Are you okay?" he asks quietly. "Dean, is Lucifer right about why you don't want to approach Michael? That you worry he might possess you?"

Dean closes his eyes, shaking his head, taking a long breath. "One thing I know for sure from the past ten years -- we go down that path, pull some big stunts, some of us are gonna end up bloody -- first time round was Sam," he points in the general direction that Sam just left, then back at Cas, "-- second time was you, and then Sam again, and you again... It's like we've been taking turns to get a deathroll number. I lost count of how many times and how many people we've lost, Cas. Think I've have enough of it."

He looks up at the angel, looking into those big blue eyes, battered. "Now, with Lucifer alone and the tricks we have, I'm pretty sure we can handle him alright now, but adding another archangel? Putting Michael and Lucifer in the same room? That sounds damn like the kind of stunt above our paygrade. So yeah, if there is any other way, *any* at all, I don't want to pull the trigger for the new round of Apocalypse. For once, we are all here and alive, you, me, Sam, I'd like to keep it that way, you hear me?"

Cas nods quietly with drooping eyes. "Okay," he says eventually.

A phone ring saves them from more talks that might would have come. Sam's phone vibrates on the desk. Dean picks it up for him.

"Sam --" Jody's voice comes out of the speaker, muffled and tired. "Do you mind come over? Bobby is here, and a few other folks you guys might want to meet."

<br>

**Words after the chapter/act:**

About the quoted lyrics, they are actually mostly real songs from real band (that are actually beautiful metal songs that I enjoyed).

"Down and out as Darkness falls, shakes the Cage in deep withdrawals. Without Darkness there's no light, but he is someone's little boy." -- Metallica "Chasing Light"

"Perdition awaits, my soul is at stake. Will I find a stairway to the skies in the end?" -- Within Temptation "Stairway to The Skies"

"I've been in Hell for many years, and all the time is lost for me, for eternity. I try to take back what was mine, a prison they have made my mind, my enemy." -- Xandria "You Will Never be Our God"

<br>

#### draft notes

~~To fix plot hole: rock festival but has metal bands & songs, Dean: "That's devil's proof right there"~~

System of a Down: "angels deserve to die" (Cas: Do I deserve to die? Do they?)

~~Beyond the Black: In the Shadows "It's so hard to kill the demons, When they live inside your heart"~~

~~"We might actually need both of them. The infection comes from Amara, we would have needed Chuck to cure this. Now that we can only get archangels, one doesn't seem quite enough."~~

<br>

(Cas's headache: Every now and then it gets so bad that he has to hold on to something to not fall. His view goes black, from several seconds to minutes. Dean always lend him a shoulder if he's within range.)

(Cas sicker, show weaker, easily tired, can't heal quickly, then headache, then cough, then cough blood, fingertips going darker, dying)

(Cas is also infected, symptom starts with can't heal, pain, weak (try to hide but found out by Dean))

Dean (quick glance and notice): You might want to wash your hands.

Cas (blink blankly): Why would I want to do that?

Dean (tilt his head towards where Cas's fingers are): You were playing mud or something?

Cas (glance down at his fingertips, inspect them, a little surprised, quiet for a bit)

Dean (observe him): You alright?

Cas: Yes. Thanks for letting me know, I'll wash it clean.

Dean (amused): Yeah no problem.

(Some time later Dean slipped it to Sam)

Sam (grim face): Angels don't need to wash hands.

Dean (stare at him): I'm pretty sure they get dirty sometimes. Remember that time when he's just back from purgatory?

Sam: Yeah I hope it's that.

Dean: What else can it be?

Sam (rotate laptop screen to him, black fingertip photo from Black Death patients)

Dean (frown, look away): Take that away, will ya? It's not that.

Sam: Dean…

Dean: If it is, he'll let us know, okay? He'll let us know, and let us help. He will.

Sam (sigh): You know him for the first day?

<br>

Dean: Don't tell me you're infected.

Cas doesn't answer.

Dean's heart sinks: you are, aren't you? Why don't you tell me?!

### Chap. 4: The Roadhouse

> souls in Heaven starts getting out of control, TFW thinks it's a case but run into Jo/Ellen/Ash/Bobby
>
> (with or without Bobby? Bobby's in Heaven's lockup since S10E17, but maybe the prison is cracked too, all troops sick and dying/dead)

#### Act 1

> INT. Jody's house - afternoon (Dean, Sam, Cas; Jody, Bobby, Ellen, Jo, Ash, other hunters)
>
> souls in Heaven starts getting out of control, TFW meet old roadhouse sacrificed people

Jody invites them in the second they knock on the door.

She looks especially exhausted in her casual clothe -- not the usual sheriff's uniform they get used to see. It must be one of her rare day offs.

"How many red lights you broke on the way?" She asks half-jokingly, leading them in. The three of them follow closely.

They made the trip to Sioux Falls in three hours.

Dean shrugs carelessly, "All of them?"

"You did ask us to come quickly," Cas supplies beside him. "It sounds urgent, too."

"Mostly because I don't really know how to host a house of ghosts, honestly." Jody tells them, walking into the living room. "And most of them are *your* friends, not mine."

They gasp at the threshold of the room.

Jody's place is like a ghost version of Roadhouse, crowded with translucent familiar figures.

Bobby stands awkwardly closest to the entry, Ash leans against the sofa, Ellen and Jo wander around the kitchen, and a few other familiar-faced ex-hunters and Roadhouse frequents occupy the dining room. They look just like how they used to be before they were gone: Bobby with his favorite baseball cap, Ash in his nerdy sleeveless shirt, Ellen in her jacket, Jo with her jeans.

Jody tells them quietly, "Alex and Claire are in Omaha for the weekend for a Radiohead concert. At least that should make things slightly easier without them jumping on ghosts or loading salt guns."

"Glad they weren't in the Los Angeles concert," Cas says plainly. Jody nods slightly.

Dean stares at the crowd dumbly, mouth gaped, not knowing what to say.

The four of them even look out of place now, for being not-ghost.

"Bobby," Dean says, slow, his voice hoarse. He looks at them, one at a time. "Ellen, Jo, Ash."

He doesn't even know all those other old hunters' names, some of them might even have passed before he's old enough for beer from Roadhouse, other names jump out from his childhood memory. "Caleb, Pastor Jim..." His voice chokes. He hasn't seen many of them for more than ten or even twenty years now.

Cas puts a gentle hand on his shoulder, grounding him.

"How?" Sam asks, in a similar choked voice, swallowing hard.

"Heaven cracked open like an egg shell." Ash explains calmly, in a scientific manner, just like he used to be when they were doing research on Apocalypse. "I was hanging around in the wild when their rooms crashed down like paper house. People wake up from their Heaven dream loops and start walking around. I found some of them using my soul-locator -- I showed you last time you went there, if you still remember -- met Ellen and Jo, and a few other folks. More joined later. But none of us knew what's happening. We didn't run into any angels, just some white-black chunks of lights here and there. The whole place is shaking like kid's toy blocks, think *Earthquake* or *The Poseidon Adventure*."

"And then we found the Heaven's prison, and we found Bobby." Ellen walks over, telling them. Then turns to Bobby, a little amused, "I still haven't figured out how you could get yourself locked up when you are in Heaven."

Bobby shrugs, answering dryly, "For helping those idjits, of course."

"Anyway," Ash continues. "No halo patrol in the prison area, either, just as empty as anywhere else. So we busted Bobby out."

"Wait, you picked locks in Heaven's prison?" Dean widens his eyes.

"Sure I did," Ash answers smoothly, proud. "Not as difficult as hacking one on Earth, I'm telling you. The angels aren't very creative at building locks, actually."

"Awesome," Dean can't help saying.

"Well, after they got me out," Bobby picks up the telling, "since I'm the only one who had some ghost experience, they just followed me. Whatever cracks Heaven's having, they started like some rifts on the wall, and turned straight into those huge black holes on the ground. We figured they look ominous, tried to avoid them, but you can't jump them all the time. Sooner or later you miss, then you fall into the Vail. Boy, the Vail is busier than Times Square this time of the year."

"Since both my place and Bobby's place were burnt down," Ellen finishes for him. "Bobby led us here, the next most familiar and safe place to stay, I suppose."

Bobby glances at Jody quickly, a little uneasy. "Sorry for not giving you a head up about the guest count."

Jody waves dismissively, "Not like I get to host spirit party everyday."

"Holy," Sam sighs, with a long exhale. He reaches a hand to Bobby just out of instinct, as if trying to touch him, hug the old man, but remember he's ghost at the last moment -- they all are. He lowers his hand, breathing out heavily.

Dean just can't stop staring. "I'm so sorry, Ellen and Jo. And Ash. Everyone." He can barely find his voice through the lump in his throat. "I never get a chance to tell you guys, those... things happened to you, I'm so sorry."

"Hey, it's okay. At least we made it to the Heaven." Jo walks out of the kitchen, coming closer to him, smiling gently. Her translucent golden hair flows naturally as she moves, as if wind can still pass through the threads of hair. She wears a short top, showing some lean muscle under, clean and complete, no sign of any wounds or cuts. She look just as young and energetic as she was before she died.

Dean can't stop thinking about those Hellhound wounds on her belly the day she and Ellen were gone. The explosion that consumed both of them in big fireballs replays in his head. He turns his gaze away, breathing shallow, trying desperately to hold his tears back. He can't bear looking at all those people they have lost all these years. Like he just said before they left the bunker -- he had long lost count of how many they have lost, and he totally didn't expect to meet all of them all at once. He doesn't know what to do, what to say -- he doesn't even dare looking at them for too long.

They are ghosts because of one mistake or another they made; they died because of them; their souls fell from Heaven into Vail now, which, is because one thing led to another and they let Darkness out and infected angels, so at the end of the day, is also because of them. Do they have to keep condemning everyone they knew from when they were alive, until long after they were dead?

Dean puts a fist to his mouth, unconsciously starting to choke himself. Just so he can hold back all the thoughts and emotions. He's afraid he might burst into tears if he doesn't leave the room quickly.

"Dean, it's not your fault." Cas whispers beside him, low and quiet, only the two of them can hear. "None of them blame you. They were happy and peaceful in Heaven."

Dean shakes his head, unable to answer. He sobs quietly, remembering the burnt-down Roadhouse ruins and Ash's torched body, the bleeding-out gush on Jo's body, the gun hole on Bobby's head. He has to excuse himself to the bathroom for a minute just to get composed again.

He stares at his own reflection in the mirror, thinking, he will not lose any more people in his life. He can't.

He comes back, standing close to the doorway leading outside, his eyes lingering on Cas. Cas turns and meets his eyes, walking over to stand right next to him.

"We should go back now." Dean whispers to him. "Lucifer. The light. The cure."

Cas nods slightly, whispering back, "What about them?"

"What about them?"

"We can't leave them here with Jody. That would be very inconvenient."

Dean can't help a small amused huff, quietly answering, "That's one way to put it."

He tilts his head. "What do you think, take them back to bunker? How can we even bring these many ghosts into bunker? Not like they have any unfinished business or connected items --"

"They followed Bobby here. Maybe if we show Bobby the way --"

"He can lead the others." Dean's eyes cheer up a little. "You're a genius, Cas."

Cas's lip curls up a small curve.

Dean walks back to the middle of the living room, glancing around him. "Listen, folks, it's been a really nice reunion, but I think it's time we jump back to work again." He points at the ceiling, gesturing, "Patching that cracked eggshell back up."

Bobby frowns. "How are you gonna do that?"

"Upstairs wasn't paradise, but it was decent." Ash says, slowly sitting straight on the sofa. "Most people get to live their happiest memory, Ellen and Jo still got a Roadhouse -- though none of the customers were real. I got to do my own things. But this?" He gestures around him, referring to all the ghosts in the room. "This is something seriously fucked up. And if I have to guess, my money is on you guys knowing something about that."

"So why don't you catch us up, and let's see how we can help?" Ellen nods at Dean, arching an eyebrow.

Dean blinks. "Help?"

"We are still hunters, sweetheart." Ellen smiles at him.

"And while you're at it, you might want to start with introducing Cas," Jo suggests, jerking her head at the old hunters looking closely in their way. "Some of the folks haven't met him before -- him, or his kind."

Their eyes sweep on Cas, landing expectantly on Dean.

Dean nods faintly, clearing his voice, gesturing at Cas. "Alright, everyone. This is Castiel. He's an Angel of the Lord. We've been working together for years." His finger draws a circle, rounding himself, Cas, and Sam in it. He finds it extraordinarily soothing to just be able to do that.

He glances at Cas and runs right into his eyes. Dean adds, "He's a close friend -- our best friend, really." He lowers his eyes, looking at the tip of his boots. His mind briefly pops a voice, quietly asking if that's the best word he can find to describe Cas, and he tells it, out of habit, *yes it is*. He looks back up at the crowd.

Ellen and Jo smile small, and Bobby nods once. Ash gives Cas a once-over, and the other folks just listen to him intently.

Dean carries on explaining the dying angel situation and the crashing Heaven problem to them. Which turns out to be a way longer explanation and storytelling than he expected. He has to go all the way back to Abaddon to explain the First Blade, then Mark of Cain, then the Darkness, to finally reach the part of explaining what's causing all those angels dying.

And the possible solution with Michael and Lucifer.

"So you are living in a dead secret community's secret base, with a locked-up Devil in it. And you want the Devil to basically willingly self-sacrifice in order to save the whole world and all the remaining angels and the falling souls." Ellen summarizes slowly.

"And by Devil, we're talking about the same Devil we ran into last time with those demons and Hellhounds and the Apocalypse?" Jo adds, eyes straight on Dean.

Dean winces, looking away. "Yes," he admits, tasting a bitterness on his tongue. "And we probably also have to help Lucifer get stronger, more powerful and brighter, to even think of making it work."

Bobby says resolutely, glancing around the crowd, "We should all go to bunker, then."

Dean nods, "Thinking the same here."

"-- And let Lucifer eat us." Bobby finishes.

Dean jumps, "WHAT?!"

Sam and Jody yell at the same time. Cas widens his eyes in surprise.

"You said yourself, we are souls," Ash says plainly, "we are basically energy batteries. Yes or no, Dean, will Lucifer get more powerful after consuming us and eventually help save the world?"

Dean glares at him. "NO!!" he yells, his eye-rims red.

The room falls quiet. They look at him.

He shakes his head, tears in his eyes, devastated.

"With souls gone, you will have nothing left." Cas tells them in a grave voice. "Do you understand? Even after Heaven is restored, you will be in nowhere, not even in the Empty. This will be absolute destruction, the ultimate death. No one can possibly bring you back again."

Ellen nods. "What's the alternative? Billions of souls fall to Earth and all continue living as ghosts for eternity? What about the real living people? What kind of life is that?"

"Please don't do this --" Dean pleads, voice shaking. "There must be another way."

"What happens to Hell when Heaven falls completely?" Jo asks suddenly.

They turn to Cas, eyes quietly waiting for an answer.

"I do not know," Cas says, grimacing. "Without the balance of Heaven, depending on the King of Hell, the Gate may open, demons and corrupted souls can escape to the surface, walking among the live, wreaking the Earth."

"The Earth will just become the living Hell," Bobby murmurs.

"So basically, everyone dies, sooner or later, and everywhere is Hell or worse," Ash concludes.

Ellen turns back to Dean, "What do you think? If we can fix that --"

"Ellen," Sam says, choking. "That would mean we'll never see you again. Or you see Bobby, or Jo, or anyone. You'll stop existing."

"I'll go with Mom," Jo says quickly. "Then whatever happens to us next, anywhere or nowhere, we go together."

Ash salutes with two fingers pressed together. "Not a big fan of living as a ghost here, had enough fun running around in Heaven too -- count me in."

Bobby smiles softly. "What's dead should stay dead, right? You better prepare a damn well farewell this time."

"No -- Not like this!" Dean stomps, protesting relentlessly. "We don't even know if Lucifer would help. If he decides he doesn't want to do shit, all these sacrifice would just be for nothing. You'll disappear for good, but for nothing! Can't we at least wait until we know for sure there absolutely isn't any other choice, to consider this?" He swallows hard. "If it's up to me, we shouldn't even *think* about that!"

"I agree," Cas resonates, watching his devastated face.

Dean makes a wet sound.

Ash points at Cas with a curled knuckle. "Thought he said you are an angel. Shouldn't you be more supportive about anything that restores orders up there? Saving angels, you know, like saving your brothers and sisters?"

"I do," Cas says serenely. "But not at the cost of losing all of you forever. You are friends of Dean's. Even as ghosts and souls, you are too important to lose. Dean will not allow that happen, nor will I."

"Same here," Sam agrees.

Ellen and Bobby exchange a look.

"Alright, then." Bobby says, with a small nod. "We try your ways first -- I'm not particularly fond of getting eaten by Satan anyway. First thing first, thought you said we are in a bit rush here? Why don't you lead the way home and we talk more later?"

"Right," Dean wipes his eyes dry, heading to the outside.

They bid Jody goodbye.

"Next time you need room for some ghost guests, you know who to call." Jody gives them each a hug.

Dean holds her tight. "Thank you," he tells her wholeheartedly.

"I didn't do anything, you did all the talking and leading." Jody smiles warmly, patting his back.

"You don't need to." Dean squeezes her shoulders. "Just, thank you, for everything."

He finally lets her go. "Call us if you need anything. Or anything with the girls --"

"Of course. You too." Jody reassures him with a motherly smile, then waves them goodbye at the porch.

They ride home -- with the ghost of Bobby sharing the back seat with Cas.

#### Act 2

> INT. bunker - night (Dean, Cas, Sam; Bobby, Ash, Ellen, Jo, Lucifer, other hunters)
>
> the ghosts come to bunker, see Lucifer, some discussion, try to look for ways, gather souls for Lucifer
>
> INT. bunker corridor - night (Dean, Jo)
>
> Jo trolls Dean about her observation on him and Cas (mood lighter, supportive friend regarding Dean/Cas), Dean avoids the topic

The view in the bunker looks surreal even for them, Dean thinks, when Bobby leads the rest of them through the Vail and into the bunker.

It looks like a proper hunting operation base camp, for once, with spacious rooms occupied by the busy hunters. Except those hunters are nothing more than foggy floating figures. Most of them haven't learned how to interact with objects yet, so they walk through the walls and doors, disappearing and appearing out of nowhere. It's nothing short of bizarre.

"House rule one: Nobody goes anywhere near the dungeon!" Dean announces once they seem to settle down, hoping the ones temporarily disappeared can also hear him.

Sam has gone off to check if the orders he commanded Lucifer to shut up and stay put was still taking effect with him out of the bunker.

Cas is missing from this orientation, too, said he needed a moment in his room the minute they were back home.

So Dean is left alone with them.

It would have been a lot easier if they're really just a bunch of old hunters hanging out in a hunter's bar. Dean can use a nice glass of drink from Ellen or Jo right about now.

"We can use as much help as we need." He tells them, gesturing to the books in the library, then the corridors outside of the war room. "We have books and everything, everyone who can touch things, feel free to start reading and go looking for ways to make an archangel recover quickly, or look for cases, find us some demons or corrupted souls we can collect. Be careful about the magical items and sigils around the place -- we don't know half what they do, so don't touch them if you don't want to get burned or something."

He glances at the group around them, mostly hanging around the war room center table now. "I think that's about it. Any questions?"

Ash raises his hand, pointing at Sam's closed laptop on the edge of the table. "Can I have one of that? Would be really helpful."

"Use mine." Dean tells him, nodding at the one sitting before him, "if you can touch it."

Ash reaches for it. His fingers pass through the surface, sinking into the wooden table. "Dammit."

He curses and tries again, but all the same.

"You'll get a hold of it," Dean comforts him, managing something as close to a smile as he can put together. "Just, take it easy. Ask Bobby if you need advice."

Bobby rolls his eyes. "What am I, ghost advisor? I was only a ghost for like half a year, and that's about five years ago."

Dean shrugs slightly. "Still more than any of us ever did."

The old hunter tries for himself to grab the laptop. It moves obediently under his ghostly fingers.

Ash raises his eyebrows. "I need to learn that."

Bobby answers dryly, "Moving a thing ain't same as typing on those tiny little buttons."

Dean leaves them for the ghost discussions and excuses himself out of the room.

He walks down the corridor leading to Cas's room.

Jo catches up with him half-way, emerging from the side wall.

Dean startles when he's about to run right into the white mist around her. "Jeez, use the floor, will ya?" He grunts, halting his steps abruptly, veering around her.

"You're not paying attention," Jo points out sharply, studying his face. Her shape settles down as she concentrates, looking more solidified as her feet touch the floor and start walking alongside him, instead of sliding. "Got something on your mind?"

Dean picks up his pace again, passing the spare rooms and storage rooms without looking. "Where do I start?" He answers glumly, glancing at Jo. "Take your pick, broken Heaven, dying angels, ghosts, the Devil --"

She looks solid enough now, so for a short minute, Dean can trick his brain to believe this really is the real Jo talking to him -- in a way, she is.

"But those aren't really the things troubling you the most, are they?" Jo glances back, raising her eyebrows.

Dean frowns. "What do you mean?"

"You've dealt with Apocalypse before -- and won. And all those other big events you told us about? End of the world sounds almost just like another Thursday now -- which, I'll guess doesn't freak you out as much as they used to. Lucifer isn't in his peak, and Sam has control over him, so that's also a relief. I don't think you really care that much about all those other angels, Dean," she pauses, looking at Dean in the eyes, "so there's only one thing -- one man, one angel -- left, really."

"Cas." Dean breathes out, having to admit. "Yeah, I'm worried about him. I got reason to."

Jo hums thoughtfully, picking her words carefully. "He seemed a little different now, since the last time I remember. The Castiel I knew was all powerful and real angelic, with all those energies and powers and wings. Now he seemed... more soft, more human."

Dean lowers his head, rubbing his temple with a bitter huff. "Yeah, tell me about it. He's gone through a lot, the life with us is tiring."  "Tiring" isn't even enough to *begin* to cover how much Cas's been through, Dean thinks. He died and came back so many times, he turned human too. He's totally exhausted lately. When's the last *he* saw Cas go all powerful and celestial? Dean frowns deeper.

"That's not what I mean," Jo cuts his thoughts off.

"What do you mean then?" Dean quirks a brow.

"Have you seen the way he looks at you?" Jo's eyes bore into Dean's, glinting with something suggestive. Ghost or not, she's a sharp girl.

He can see what's coming. Dean feels his skin starts cringe already, he shifts his gaze away, speeding up the pace. "I'm not talking about this," he says decisively.

"Dean --" Jo sighs.

"Jo!" Dean cuts her off quickly. They are about reaching Cas's room now. He can see lights seeping from under the crack of his doorframe.

He turns around to face Jo fully. "Listen, I appreciate the talk, alright? I really do." He shuts his eyes for a second, wondering detachedly how their life has come to this, how he ended up talking about... things he didn't want to think about, with his friends who have died and come back as ghosts. But really, he does appreciate the gesture -- "But, we're not talking about it, not here, not today." *If ever.* His mind supplies. He glances down the corridor before turning back to Jo.

He finds Jo's gaze follow his, knowing exactly what he's looking at. He shifts uneasily again.

"Alright," Jo answers lightly, throwing her hands up. "Just saying... if you need someone to talk to, you know where to find me. Or if anyone else, my mom, Bobby, your old friends -- now's the chance."

Now she really looks like the little sister he never had.

Dean gives her a small nod. "Thanks, Jo."

He continues down the corridor hastily.

<br>

> INT. bunker, Cas's room - night (Dean, Cas)
>
> Cas sicker, more symptom, Dean worries

The door is closed tight in Cas's room. He realizes the light seeping out at the edge of the door is shivering, flickering violently. It's not the bedside lamp type of light, but the glazing bright white-blue light. The one from angel grace.

Dean's heart clutches. He pounds on the door. "Cas, you okay in there? Can I come in?"

A shrieking pitch sounds up from inside, piercing through the air like a blade. It sounds like angel's true voice, the one cracked the gas station window when Cas first tried to speak to him before meeting him in a vessel. Except the voice this time sounds even higher and more shrilly than that time, sounding like a combination of warning and yelling of pain.

Dean has to cover his ears at the sound of that, his eardrums might be bleeding otherwise. The light under the doorframe recedes slowly.

"What's happening, Cas?" Dean raises his voice, fumbling the doorknob with his elbow.

He manages to turn the door open and rushes in without waiting for an answer.

The last thread of silvery grace light flows into Cas's mouth right at the same moment as Dean bursts in. Cas's eyes are brightened up for a short while, and then it fades completely.

Cas is kneeling by the bedside chair, hands grabbing the chair arms, barely holding himself upright. His whole body is shaking violently like a winter leaf. He frowns so deeply that every crinkled line on his face is saying pain in its own way.

"What's that?" Dean rushes to his side, bending over, looking at Cas closely. His face is more pale than a sheet of paper. His lips trembling. Sweat hanging on his forehead. He doesn't remember ever seeing Cas sweat.

Cas takes a few shallow breathes before answering shakily, "I didn't want you to see me like that, Dean."

He tries to get up on his shaky legs, using the chair to pull himself up. Dean lends him a hand and helps him turn around and sit down.

Cas pants at the effort.

"Well, sorry, I worried." Dean watches him with a heavy frown. "Why did you leave your body? Going anywhere?"

"I can better examine my condition in my true form," Cas confesses.

"Okay? So that's good or bad?" Dean prompts.

"It's... not improving." Cas chooses words carefully.

"Not improving? What do you mean 'not improving'?" Dean is alarmed. "The healing is slow or not at all?"

Cas swallows, hesitant.

"Cas?"

"Not at all," he stares at the floor of the room, almost like he's ashamed, as if it's his fault. "My grace is failing consistently, and I can't do anything about it. That's why it's making me so tired and weak all the time ever since I came back from Heaven. I tried to keep it together when we were out there, but it is very exhausting."

Dean inhales sharply, wiping his face. He kneels down beside the chair so that he can look at Cas better. He leaves his hands on Cas's knees, looking up, and saying with a voice that's so pained that as if merely saying it is already tearing his heart apart. He says, shakily, "Tell me you're not infected."

Cas looks at him with sad eyes. "I don't know," he answers quietly.

"You don't know?"

"I don't know if it's something different in me, or different symptom, or I'm just too tired." Cas's breath comes even now. He pauses, and considers. Dean's heart beats fast.

"What's different?"

"If I am --" Cas gestures his body, "if I'm infected with the same Angel Black Death as all the other angels, I should be dead by now. The infected darkness would have eaten away my remaining grace, and I wouldn't be able to even talk to you. At best, I'll be one of those shrieking, waning lights before going out. But now I'm just tired and weak, and can't heal myself -- I don't know what's happening to me."

Dean breathes rapidly, "Okay, okay -- still bad, but not super-duper bad, that's good news to me. There gotta be ways to help you, right? Angel medicine, angel vitamin, anything?"

Cas looks at him, pulling a tight smile, saying slowly, "There is one thing I notice that does help wondrously."

"What's that?"

"I feel better whenever you're close," he says quietly. Eyes on Dean, but uncharacteristically uncertain.

Dean blinks. "Now really isn't a good time for flirting, Cas." He hears himself saying.

"No, it's the fact," Cas says with a straight face. "I don't know why, but every time you are around, I feel significantly better."

Dean rubs his cheeks, huffing a small laugh. "That sounds exactly like chick-flicks."

He runs into Cas's serious eyes, and Dean swallows, forcing his voice go lighter. "Alright, Sap, stay close then. We'll figure out how to fix you up."

"Thank you," Dean hears a quiet murmur from Cas.

"Sure thing." He stands up and pats the angel on his shoulder.

<br>

> INT. bunker dungeon - night (Sam, Lucifer)
>
> Lucifer taunts Sam, show some overtaking, lead to next hint of Mary/John's souls in Lawrence, Kansas

Lucifer sits in a yoga pose when Sam checks on him, a lingering smirk hanging on his face.

*Sam.* He mouths, no sound coming out.

Sam smiles a little, can't help enjoying probably a tad too much just to see Lucifer chained and powered down. He wonders what else he can demand the Devil do now. For a moment, he thinks he can totally understand why Crowley would go through all the trouble and just to make Lucifer his bitch. It does feel good.

But he has to remind himself he's better than this -- better than a revengeful demon, better than the Devil. He drops his smile.

Lucifer blinks innocently, looking at him with a kicked puppy look, mouthing again. *Sam --*

Sam shakes his head disapprovingly at himself, then harshly, "What?"

"You got quite a crowd up there." Lucifer sniffs the air, smiling fawningly and asking, "Did you bring me any snack? You know, sweet little tasty bits, blinking like small stars?"

"Not yet. Just, wait." Sam shifts uneasily. "How's... how's your power?"

The Devil shrugs. "Same as yesterday, slow. You do know it usually takes millennia to get on top, right? Time is usually a cheap thing, something we have too much, unlike lately --"

Sam shrugs. "Normally I'd say that's a good thing."

Lucifer pretends a crinkled frown. "That hurts. But that's okay, I'll let that pass. I'm a generous man." He huffs slightly.

Sam snorts a humorless laugh. "Right. You, generous."

"I am!" Lucifer says sulkily, pouting like a young child. "Admit it, I've been good lately, Sam. Especially to you." He shakes the angel cuffs on his wrists, glaring at it. "Can't I get off these bloody things for a minute? You know you can always put them back on anyway, with all the headwire thing." He circles his temple with a finger, giving a short whistle to company the gesture.

Sam's lips twitch. "No," he tells the Devil firmly. "You're 'good' only because you're our little bitch now. We'd like to keep it that way."

"That's not very nice, considering you still need my help," Lucifer scolds, sitting straight, eyes burning with a hint of rage.

Sam is taken aback slightly, wetting his lips uneasily. "What you want?"

"You know exactly what I want. You are like the most difficult prom date I've ever asked, Sam." Lucifer purrs.

"No." Sam shakes his head violently, his finger pointing at the Devil's face. "And it will always and forever be 'No'. You can stop dreaming."

"Even for saving the world, again?" Lucifer grinds ruthlessly. "Even for saving your brother and your best buddy, and your dear mommy and daddy?"

"No -- And my parents are already dead, can't believe you're still using them as bait." Sam snorts.

Lucifer looks at him like a teacher looking at a slow student. "Sam, Sam," he says with a half-hearted sigh. "Where do dead souls go nowadays? I thought you already knew that. Meeting your proxy Dad is one thing, what do you say, time to meet your real Dad now?"

Sam freezes.

After quickly putting the mute button on the Devil and closing the dungeon door again, he runs up the stairs two steps at a time.

"Dean -- we need to find Mom and Dad now --"

<br>

### Chap. 5: The Winchesters

> Heaven gets even more loose, John/Mary get down (Missouri called them), Winchesters (happy?) reunion dinner, like in show S14E13; but include Cas as part of family, officially in front of parents
>

#### Act 1

> INT. bunker garage - night (Dean, Sam, Cas)
>
> Dean gets phone call from Missouri, they know John/Mary's ghosts are here, they drive to Lawrence, Kansas

Dean is about finishing up a phone call when Sam finds him.

He's in the garage, frowning at the ground, pacing with his phone at his ear. One hand clenching a wiping clothe. A bucket of water sits on the ground beside Baby, which is slowly dripping water.

"Thank you," he says to the other end wholeheartedly, his voice caught. Almost like the moment they went into Jody's house.

Sam dashes to him, noticing Cas stands on the other side of the parked Impala, also with some cleaning supplies in his hands, but now just standing there, eyes following Dean's pacing.

Dean slips the phone back into pocket and turns around, almost running right into his brother.

"I got news," Sam rushes.

Dean raises an eyebrow. "I got news, too. You first."

"I think Mom and Dad's souls also fell to the Earth." Sam is a little breathless. "You know, since the Heaven is cracking up, and I'm pretty sure they were both there before. Bobby and those others came down, they must also --"

"And I know exactly where they are." Dean smiles slightly at him, nodding at the phone now in his pocket with his chin. "That's Missouri."

"Wait, Missouri Moseley? Oh wow, that must been, what, ten years now? Since last time we met her." Sam raises his eyebrows in surprise.

"Yeah, I know." Dean rubs his nose, walking slowly back to car. "Since Dad went missing on a hunting trip and I picked you up from school. It's like a lifetime ago."

Sam lets out a breath. "What did she say?"

"Apparently when Mom and Dad dropped from Heaven, they went straight to our old house." Dean stands next to the car's driver seat, wiping his hand absently. "But they couldn't, because we taught that woman living in our house, Jenny, too well last time, and the house was protected by salt lines and irons and sigils. So they were just drifting outside the house, a couple of unharmful white misty ghosts, and Missouri noticed. She invited them over to her place."

"I don't know she's still keeping an eye on our old house, after all these times." Sam shakes his head unbelievably.

"Neither do I." Dean wipes his hands again, then starts wiping a small spot on the rear mirror mindlessly. "I'm just so freaking glad she did."

He moves to the trunk, throwing the wiping cloth inside, gesturing for Cas to finish up his side too. "Guess we're going home again."

Sam helps to move that bucket of water away. "And meeting Mom and Dad, together, for the first time," he adds, smiling weakly, not knowing how to feel exactly. That's something he never thought he'd see one day, and now the idea almost intimidates him.

Dean eases into the driver's seat, lighting the engine. Cas slides into the back seat.

Sam hesitates outside the passenger seat. "Uh, Dean?" his voice sounds strange.

Dean looks up at him. "What?"

Sam ducks his head in Cas's direction, the move subtle. "You sure it's a good idea?"

Dean glances reflexively at the angel on the backseat, raising his eyebrows. "Yes. Why?"

Sam swallows. "I don't want to be a dick, but... it's going to be a family moment."

"Cas is family, what's the problem?" Dean rolls his eyes.

"Dad might not see it that way," Sam says quietly, struggling to get words out. "You know how he was. He might... not be very happy about it."

"Then Dad can cope with it." Dean snaps, insistent. "Cas is coming."

Sam glances at Cas with a guilty look, sitting into the passenger seat.

Cas frowns slightly, looking from Dean to Sam. From where he's sitting, he can see half Dean's side and only Sam's back. "It sounds improper for me to be in this trip," he says with a low voice, reaching to the door handle. "I will leave you with your family."

"Cas!" Dean stops him harshly. "You are family. And you come with us." There is a undefiable resolute in his voice. Castiel retracts his hand.

The car races out of the garage, heading east under a starry sky.

<br>

> INT. Missouri's house - late night (Dean, Cas, Sam, Missouri, Mary, John)

It's a short drive. Two hours is barely enough to keep the mind ready and the psychic's house is already in the view.

The town is fast asleep in the past-midnight hours. They are the only car on the road, and Missouri's house is the only one with lights on in the block.

Dean parks in front of the building.

The town looks barely changed from the last time they were there, so is Missouri.

"Come on in," she gestures the way through the corridor after giving them each a pat on the arm.

Dean glances back at Sam and Cas quickly, anxiety rising like bubbles on the sea. He follows her, and the other two follow him.

The living room is a few degrees colder than the rest of the house, even with the lit candles at the edge of the walls. Dean realizes the lights they saw from outside through the curtains are actually the flickering candlelights.

"That should help them stable," Missouri knows exactly what they want to ask, nodding at the candles and the pattern they connect. There are sigils written on the floor and walls, too. "A ritual I learned, connecting the spirits with our physical world. Help them grounded, connected to the things or people they care most about -- you."

Sam gives him a tight, appreciated smile and a quiet "Thank you."

"I'll leave you boys to it then," Missouri takes a step to the side once they're in the living room. "Call me if you need anything, I'll be on the second floor."

Dean nods dumbly, eyes can't tear away from the figures sitting on the sofa.

There, on the center of the sofa, John and Mary sit side by side, with their hands braided together, looking like one of his old family photos. Except without a cradled baby between them.

"Mom. Dad." Dean husks, closing the remaining steps between them,

###### [TBA]

#### draft notes

S01E09 the woman living in their old house: Jenny, the toddler: Ritchie (12y old now)

John/Mary's reaction on apparent Dean/Cas relationship/friendship/closeness → a little acceptance process, but in the end supportive; officially included in the Winchester family now (could be difficult in the beginning with John, but John has been in Heaven, so the peace in Heaven helped ease his temper/anger control issue)

for later: John/Mary stay with them when Dean/Sam say yes to Michael/Lucifer, might make it easy as a support/family/love to help them regain control and break free. All those other important people in their lives are the key for them to regain control

for later: When Michael comes back in Adam's vessel, there will be interaction between John/Adam, and Mary's reaction to it (could get awkward)

#### Act 1

> INT. bunker (Dean, Cas, Sam, Lucifer)
>
> Dean/Sam know Cas is infected, go to Rowena to open Cage to get Michael out

"Suit yourself. Good luck watching *him* die then, while you sort your shit out," Lucifer says joyfully, pointing a finger at Cas.

Dean narrows his eyes. "What did you do?"

"Cas, you ready to tell him or should I?" Lucifer raises his voice, pointedly looking at Castiel.

Dean turns to him, worried and annoyed. "Tell me what? Cas, what is it?"

Lucifer sighs dramatically. "A little tip, check his hands. You might want to wash your hands."

Cas quickly tries to put his hands into his pocket, only to be grabbed by Dean at the wrist.

"Dean, it's nothing." Cas starts saying.

Dean ignores him, turning the angel's palms over. There, on all the fingertips, the skin has a darker color, like a black muddy coat. Almost like when one put their hands in a muddy pond and comes out dirty.

Sam gasps quietly beside them.

Dean stares at him, "Don't tell me you're infected."

Cas takes his hand back, looking down, not answering.

Dean's heart sinks. "You are, aren't you? You bastard, why don't you tell me?!"

"We have enough to worry about," Cas says quietly, "I don't want to burden you."

"Dammit Cas! How many times do I have to tell you you're not burden?" Dean yells at him. Cas flinches.

"I thought you said you were warded last time, you were fine because --" He shoots Lucifer a glance, "you were protected or something."

Lucifer comments, "That totally wasn't my intention. But you're welcome."

"I think it's the time I went to Heaven when I heard their agony." Cas says weakly.

"The trip that almost killed you? That now it's actually killing you?" Dean wipes his face. "I told you don't go! I TOLD YOU! Just let the flying monkeys do whatever they do, leave them be!"

Cas glares at him at that. "I can't!" He snaps back. "Do angels just deserve to die? Why would I just be an exception then?!"

Dean swallows.

"Guys," Sam urges, putting a hand on both of them, pulling them apart slightly. "What are we going to do next? Cas, do you know how long do you have?"

"As much as any other angels." Cas answers glumly.

"Which means not much time, so, chop chop." Lucifer says gloatfully.

"We *have* to get Michael now," Sam says, defeated.

Dean's still glaring at Cas, who avoids his eyes.

Dean takes a step back, sighing deeply. "I'll get the car ready. You give Rowena a head up we're on our way. And give Crowley a call too, we're going to Hell, again."

<br>

> INT. Cage - dark (Dean, Sam, Cas, Rowena, Crowley, Michael)
>
> Rowena gets Michael out

It feels like a Deja Vu again, going to Hell, going to the Cage in the nowhere. Descending the stairs into nothingness, with a demon and a witch on their side.

Rowena is surprisingly cooperative. And Dean points it out.

"What's the problem with you guys?" the witch rolls her eyes. "We don't do what you want, you're upset; we do what you want, you're upset. Make your mind, will ya?"

Dean rolls his eyes too. "Jeez, just saying I'm surprised, that's all."

"You are just sadistic, I know. Poor Dean." Rowena gives him an exaggerated smile. "Can't believe anything that's too easy to get -- a cake on a plate with a cherry on top, for example, or an angel." She glances at Cas pointedly. Dean averts his eyes, ignoring the twist in his guts.

The Cage hangs in the middle of nothingness, locked by iron chains wiring it around all its corners. The small confined space they used to temporarily talk to Lucifer -- which turned out to be not so temporarily -- still stand on the ground.

Rowena sets up her cauldron and the ingredients at the edge of where light still reaches, starts murmuring the spells. The runes and sigils carved on the Cage brightens up. A low rumbling sound like a distance thunder is rolling closer. More and more intense as the spell sinks in.

"Shouldn't we prepare him a vessel like the one Crowley did for Lucifer?" Dean suddenly remembers, turning slightly to whisper at Cas's ears. But the demon overhears it.

"Sorry, one and only. Not exactly a vessel retail factory around here, in case you didn't notice." Crowley says dryly.

Dean shrugs.

"He still had Adam." Cas says, then grimaces. "I'm sorry not saving your half-brother when I saved Sam."

"Dude, don't blame everything on you, that's like -- six years ago now?" Dean nudges him slightly. "My fault too, if you want to play the finger-pointing game. Death gave me a choice, Sam or Adam, I saved Sam."

Cas gives him a sad look. Dean returns with a sad smile of his own.

Rowena's chanting continues, then halts abruptly. Their attention turns back to the ritual.

The witch slices her palms and claps them together, yelling the last pose: "Torzul d, zamran!"

The symbols on the Cage all lightens up at the same time, glowing together, combining into one, as bright as the Sun. The distant rumbling sound now becomes the thunder and lightening right on top of their head.

"He'll kill us!" Dean suddenly realizes, yelling, covering his eyes. He feels Cas hurries closer to him, then a shadow covers over his head. But he can't open his eyes to see.

"Vaporize, not kill!" Rowena yells back.

"What's the difference?!" Dean is pissed. They're going to die from this stupid plan, and he's going to spend his last breath bickering with a three-hundred-year old witch.

Then the blinding light recedes, a figure with the shadow of six wings descending from the air.

Dean chances a glance. The figure wears Adam's body. But he doesn't want to think if that kid is still in there somewhere or butchered even worse than Sam's soul worse.

"Michael," Cas is the first to speak. He straightens up, and Dean finds the shadow around him disappear, so does a soothing sense of security he felt just a moment ago. He blinks.

"You wouldn't have been able to protect them, even with your wings, if I wanted to destroy every one of you," Michael says solemnly.

"That's comforting," Dean comments. *Wings?* He mouths to Cas, who gives him a tiny little nod for confirmation like it's just the most normal thing.

Michael turns to Dean slowly, looking at him straight. "Now, where can I get a decent burger or pizza? Adam is starving."

<br>

#### Act 2

> INT. bunker - day (Dean, Sam, Cas, Michael)
>
> Michael meets Lucifer, Winchester counseling time for Michael/Lucifer, help them make peace
>
> Michael/Lucifer align to destroy world and let angels just die so they can control the world

They sit across the table, staring at an archangel who's gulping at a piece of pizza.

A piece of pizza that comes from frozen pizza.

Dean watches him, not sure he should frown or amuse, so his face is twitches between the two. Sam has both his eyebrows raised high. Cas stares at him with narrowed eyes.

"... Adam?" Dean chances.

The kid looks up, with a bright look on his face, looking... happy. "This is so good," Adam answers. His voice is distinguishably higher than Michael's.

"Michael lets you take over?" Sam asks the question in all their minds.

"We sort of have an agreement," Adam says casually, in the middle of biting and chewing. "There isn't much to do in the Cage, you know. Just the two of us."

"So I heard," Dean blinks.

"And Michael said you were the reason we were stuck down there for so long." Adam says. "It's not seven years, you know."

"It's not?" Sam prompts.

"Shit," Dean blurts. He's been there forty years, in Hell, and came back to find it's only four months on Earth. Time flows differently.

"It's like a thousand years." Adam nods, taking another huge bite on the frozen pizza, swallowing it almost without chewing. "I'm starving."

Dean shifts in his chair uncomfortably. There is nothing to say to that. A thousand years, and now they want Michael's help. Dude is merciful enough not to blow them up on the spot.

"I'm sorry," Dean hears himself saying.

"We discussed this, it's not your fault." Cas says quickly, "It's mine."

"And mine," Sam cuts in, giving them both a look. "I'm the one dragging you in, that's an accident."

"That's right, Sam," Michael puts down the pizza Adam is busy eating, they can tell the change just from the pose and voice he's using. Not like either of them are trying to pretend to be the other. "That is your fault."

Sam swallows hard, almost like immediately shrinking small in his chair. "I'm sorry. But I have to."

"Then you must understand there is something I have to do as well." Michael announces, standing up.

"And what's that?" Dean hurries up as well, watching Michael's every move.

"The closure," he says definitively, moving out of the room. "The thing I should have done a thousand years ago, before the fall. I have to fight Lucifer."

He regards the room with lights in his eyes. "And I can sense him. You have him here. So I will meet him, and I will end everything like it should be."

Dean marches in front of him, blocking his way. Cas follows him one step behind.

"Come on, you don't *have to* kill Lucifer. He's your brother! You can just... talk to him!" Dean tries.

"Like that went so well every time with you and Sam." Michael doesn't stop, just keep walking. Dean has to walk backward, glancing back not to fall. So Cas lends him a hand. Sam follows them in a ten-step distance.

"Mikey, so good to see you again." Comes Lucifer's long slimy voice from the other end of the war room the minute they enter.

"What's him doing here? I thought he's supposed to be in the dungeon?!" Dean turns to Sam.

"I can't keep watching him and commanding him what to do twenty-four seven, Dean!" Sam vents out bitterly. "Why don't *you* do the watching next time? Oh right, I forget, I'm the only one who can! So live with it!"

Dean stares at him. "What crawled up your ass and died? Already bad enough to live with Devil, now we have to live with this?"

"Look at them," Lucifer chuckles, gesturing at them, talking to Michael, "bickering like we did when we were young, you remember that?"

Michael's marching steps slow down. He rounds the table in the war room, slowly closing their distance. "I remember," he says in a low serious voice. "That's eons ago. There isn't many stars. Dad was still creating them."

Lucifer laughs, "The stars! Right. Don't you usually love to call every single one of them Andromeda or something?"

Michael widens his eyes slightly, surprised. "You remember?"

"Of course I do." Lucifer says easily, "Dad has to make a huge Andromeda there just to keep you from asking over and over again. And you still think it's too small."

A small grin finds its way onto Michael's lips. "That's even before Raphael was created. The whole world is just you and me. Not even Dad came home that often. And we thought it's gonna be like that for forever."

Lucifer nods eagerly. "Don't you miss that? The simplicity. The quiet world. Stars spinning, sea waving. Just you and me. Quiet and calm. We were free! And Dad just *had* to create more things to ruin it."

Michael stops his steps, thinking.

"See, you're talking, that's good. Right?" Dean speaks in a forced cheerful voice, encouraging. Sam gives him a weird look.

Michael pulls out his golden blade. "That's just your trick, Lucifer, I see through you," he says, marching toward the Devil again. "I'm not nostalgic."

Lucifer hurries around the table, circling it so they are always separated by the tables and chairs in between. "But you do want that, don't you? Come on, Mikey, just you and me, like old times."

"It's Michael." Michael corrects him automatically. His grip on the blade is firm, but his steps hesitant.

"Why do you want to kill him so much anyway?" Dean blurts out, from the threshold of the war room -- the "war" room, damn, that's too fitting.

Michael throws him a glance. "That's my destiny. I have to do it."

"And why's that?" Dean follows quickly. "Because he's evil? Because you hate him? Because Daddy said so? What?"

Michael stills. He never really think about that. "I... don't hate you," he says slowly, looking at Lucifer. "I loved you."

Dean blinks rapidly. Okay, he didn't see this coming.

Lucifer slows his pace, too. He stutters, "That's... that's... I don't know what to say."

"It's all just part of Dad's plan. He told me to kill you, so I'm doing it." Michael lowers the blade in his hand.

"Daddy's blunt instrument," Cas whispers, reciting. "It is the same on Earth as it is on Heaven."

Dean flinches at that, shaking his head in disbelief.

"Anyone is gonna tell them how big of a pain in the ass Chuck is?" Dean talks under his breath.

Michael hears him anyway, looking sharply at his direction. "You have seen God?"

Dean doesn't expect the attention shift back to him so soon, glancing at Cas and Sam quickly. He answers, "Yeah, just a dorky little guy, a writer, apparently. We helped him fight against Amara last year."

"And guess who's invited to the party?" Lucifer says, raising his hand, then pointing at Michael, "And guess who isn't?"

"I didn't even know," Michael says, distressed. "Dad is back but he didn't even bring me out of Cage? Why would he invite you, instead of me? Did He forget about me?" He stops circling the tables, just leaning on one edge, holding his hands on it, supporting his body as if the weight suddenly become too much.

Dean exchanges an anxious look with Cas and Sam, none of them know how to answer to that.

Lucifer watches his brother closely, leaning in cautiously. "Not just forget, I think He didn't care. I'm sorry, Michael. I even mentioned we needed you, last time we locked Auntie away, it took Dad plus all four of you. So I told him, 'We need Michael, he's in the Cage.' And you know what Dad said?"

Michael glances up at him, waiting.

"Nothing! Dear old Dad didn't say anything, we just moved on, talking about battle plans." Lucifer announces.

"He didn't care about me." Michael says, with dawning realization. He pulls a chair and sits down heavily, the blade left forgotten on the table. Looking far too tired and defeated. "I did everything he asked, I was even ready to murder the brother I practically raised. And he didn't even come for me in the Cage."

Lucifer rounds the table, carefully planting his hand on Michael's shoulder. "It sucks, I know. And Dad left this world again, by the way," he says, looking down at Michael. "But you still got me, Brother."

Michael doesn't move, just staring at the air in front of him, murmuring. "Why would he do that?"

"Less about why, more about what, what do you say?" Lucifer tells him, almost gently. "So, you and me, we are good?"

Michael nods wordlessly.

Lucifer winks at the threshold where the Winchesters and Castiel have been staying.

Dean and Sam let out a long relieved breath. Cas's face is still grim.

"Told you, talking works perfectly, right?" Dean grins, starting to walk into the room. Cas whispers a low "Careful" behind him.

Lucifer shoots him a quick glance.

Michael doesn't bother looking up.

"Can we start talking about the plan to save the angels now?" Dean asks.

"No," Michael answers, single-syllably.

"What?" Dean blinks.

"I said, 'No'." Michael repeats, raising his tired head.

"You didn't even hear me out, Buddy." Dean struggles to put on half a smile.

"I don't care," Michael answers, disinterestedly.

"The angels are dying of the Darkness infection! The Angle Black Death thingy, look at Cas! Only you guys can save them. Come on, aren't you supposed to be all brothers and sisters?" Dean urges, starting to get desperate.

"Not really," Michael says, breaking his hope. "I only have one real brother, and he's right here. Not even Raphael and Gabriel are close to us. If all the other angels are dying, I don't really care. There is no one else at the beginning of time besides us, and I think --" he glances at Lucifer quickly, "-- I'd like that two-people time."

"What about Adam?" Sam ventures. "You seem to care for him."

"Adam and I spent a thousand years together. Lucifer and I eons. What do you think?" Michael asks emotionlessly.

Dean huffs annoyedly.

Lucifer pats Michael on the shoulder, gesturing to his body. "Another thing, Bro, those annoying human tied this body to the Cage magic, you think you can do anything about that?"

Michael snaps his fingers.

Sam yells a desperate "No --"

The Devil's eyes shine bright and bloody red with a huge grin.

<br>

**Notes for the chapter:**

The spell Rowena used to open Cage: "Torzul d, zamran!" was referenced from the Enochian Lucifer used to rise Death. The Enochian can be roughly translated as: "Rise, show!"

#### draft notes

Cas: With their damaged half-full grace, we may need both of them.

Sam: Or we help them recover, get them on top of their power and then do the rest.

Dean: ~~That's your idea? That's dumbest idea in a pool of dumb idea you've ever come up with.~~ Wow, I can't even decide which one is dumber.

Dean: Come on, it's like putting two nuclear together and hope they don't explode! What's the odds?

<br>

poke Michael, remind him last year (s11) Chuck needed help from archangel and he turned to Lucifer for help, didn't even cross his mind to save Michael from Cage, hardly his favorite son

they try to poke Michael: "Michael is God's favorite soldier, but Lucifer is his favorite son."

Michael retort: "just like Dean is John's favorite soldier, Sam is his favorite son.")



They all agree Dean should get nowhere close to Michael and same goes for Sam and Lucifer, so Sam and Rowena go to Michael, Dean and Cas go to Lucifer

Michael/Lucifer counseling session: Do you remember the time when...

Michael/Lucifer deciding not saving angels: There is no darkness without light, so if they're all gone, so is the disease. Problem solved.

### Chap. 8: On the Crossroad

> to stop Michael/Lucifer and save Cas/Heaven, Sam/Dean says yes, things get dirty, take back control, sacrifice/kill each other, explodes and kills Michael/Lucifer (in Heaven), purifies angels in Heaven, Heaven is saved, fallen souls/spirits are retrieved by angels restart working
>
> Cas think they're dead (which is true), go to Heaven/Vail to find them, try to save them again, find in a setting like HP King's Cross (rewrite as Dean's memory), let them decide if they want back
>
> Dean's decision point: choose Heaven/John/Mary and have his peace, or Earth/Cas and continue living
>
> Dean choose Cas and both Sam/Dean back to Earth (Sam is a 6-month swaddle, Dean makes the decision)
>
> (The Brightest light that save Heaven and world is Dean+Sam's love to the world/Cas and their willingness of self-sacrifice)

#### Act 1

> INT. bunker (Dean, Cas, Sam, Lucifer, Michael)
>
> to stop Michael/Lucifer and save Cas/Heaven, Sam/Dean says yes

Lights explode in the bunker. Lightening flickers, thunder tumbling. The shadow of archangel wings cast onto them, high and huge, like the black curtain of the night sky itself. Lucifer stretches his shoulder, turning his arms around comfortably, twisting them around as if it's just some kind of morning exercise warm-up. All the while the air is filled with buzzing electricity.

The air is unsettling, hairs standing -- it's probably that acute sense of death before the actual moment that people sometimes talked about, the premonition of death. Dean thinks. There is no way out this time.

He feels that subtle cover of warmth and safety again, invisible, melted into the air, but it's there. He turns to look at Cas.

Castiel has his eyes shut, frowning so deeply his whole face is crumbled. His shoulders are hunched. The light from him is so dim compared to Lucifer's but it's still there. And Dean can see it. He can see it so vividly now and it horrifies him. He sees dark circles curling inside that light, but Cas is still trying his best to stretch his wings out, covering on him and Sam. His wings, oh God, they are so battered, broken, barely only the wing bone keeping the shape. The black shadows of feathers are continuously dropping and falling just as he watches. He can't see them in the reality, but he imagines them falling on to him right now.

Even in the combined wraith of Michael and Lucifer, even when Cas *knew* the archangels can kill him, kill them as simple as snapping a finger, he would do everything he can to save Dean, to protect Dean, to have his wings cover Dean even when they're burned and broken.

At the moment of death, Dean finds his mind drift away from the crumbling Heaven, from the endangered angels, the falling souls, the archangels that are about to destroy the world or just let the world destroy itself. He finds his mind wander out, and circle around Cas. He should have helped Cas fix wings. He should have asked if Cas miss fly, miss home. He should have talked to Cas about so many other things but they never did. All they ever do is just being there, always being there wherever they go. And he remembers -- it feels too long, and he remembers when he set out to the suicide mission of assassinating Amara, that eve of his death, Cas told him, "I could go with you." He meant to come back and ask him why he said that. When they embraced the reunion and celebrated the victory. He really was thinking that, when they were drinking late that night. He remembers thinking to himself, he'd ask once he finished that glass of drink in his hand, and then he always reach for a next glass thinking he'd do that after that one.

There are things should have been done. There are words should have been said.

Dean looks at Cas's broken wings, in the menace of Lucifer's wraith, thinking, they're broken, but they're still so beautiful, so bright and beautiful. They're Cas's.

He pushes Cas aside. The thin warm sense of cover slide away.

Dean stands straight, talking to Michael directly. Not wincing at the light, not blinking.

He says: "Yes."

<br>

"What?" Lucifer pauses his hand rising above his head, blinking his bloody red eyes in confusion.

"NO, DEAN!" Cas yells, desperate. "Don't do this!"

Sam gasps loudly, the sound of air pulsing into his lung vibrating through him.

And Michael, finally stirred from his stoic stance, raising a stopping hand at Lucifer, then turning to Dean. He stares into his soul, and asks, "What did you say?"

Dean meets his eyes straight on. "I said Yes, you son of a bitch."

<br>

###### [TBC]

#### draft notes

Michael to Dean: I know it's too easy to give your own life for the angel you care, but are you willing to give your brother's life for him too?

(To save Cas, Sam/Dean has to become Michael/Lucifer)

Dean: Sonofabitch, yes! I said, yes!

Cas: Dean, don't!

Dean: I have to, I can't let you die, I just can't.

<br>

(The Sam/Dean stabbing happens in Heaven, after Michael/Lucifer flies to Heaven together. So when they stab, the purification happens only on Heaven, explains why Cas is not cured.)

<br>

Cas to Dean: You'll never risk your brother.

Dean: But you think I'll risk you? There is a chance I can get you back, I won't grasp it?

Cas: (bite his lips) Dean-- you don't have to--

Dean (cut): You're right, I don't have to, I *want* to. Never think you're anything less in this family, Cas. I know you would do same for me or Sam, and Sam do same for you or me. So just, for once, shut up and let me save your ass, alright?

Cas: (watery eyes, nod)

Dean: (wipe Cas's eyes with back of his hand, whisper mockingly quietly) Princess.

Cas: (quietly chuckle, smile but still saddest smile with big blue eyes) Thank you.

**OR:**

Cas: Dean, don't. I didn't ask for you to do this. I would never.

Dean: You don't need to, I offered.

Cas: And Sam's life too? You can't ask this of him.

Sam: He didn't. Dean's right, you're family, we do everything for our family, whatever it takes.

Dean squeeze a smile: Hey don't be a damper, we might win, you know. Sammy beats Lucifer once, who said we can't do it again, both of us, together.

Cas: Michael and Lucifer won't allow a second times, it's near zero chance.

Sam: Near zero,  not absolute zero. We still have chance.

Dean: Don't worry, everything will be fine. Just take a nap, we'll probably be back before you know it.

Cas: Or you can be gone for good, you won't even be in Heaven.

Dean: Let's not think about that for now, okay? Besides, I heard Heaven isn't a paradise with lullaby, don't think I'm a big fan anyway.

Dean pats his shoulder, staying there for a few minutes. They just look at each other in silence for several extended seconds. And Dean departs.

When Dean is at the door, Cas says behind him, quietly: Come back to me, please.

Dean pauses and nods briefly but didn't look back. He's afraid he might not have the courage again to walk out of that room if he did.

<br>

### Chap. 9: The Brightest Light

> Cas uses up his power to get Sam/Dean back, is still dying because he wasn't in Heaven the purifying explosion happened; one cured angel/Dumah comes to bunker to explain+offer Heaven in their command (because Sam/Dean prove themselves more bright than archangels, they're practically new archangel/god in their eyes), Dean's soul is the brightest light, Dean can save Cas but only if he let himself be honest with his feelings, be open for the first time, Dean uses his soul power to touch Cas and purify/save Cas, soul-grace dance, don't need to say love but so much more than love, there is no word for them even "love" isn't enough, Cas is saved, all HE
