When we were lying on my bed, sweaty, panting, tasting the last flavor of that sweet satisfying sensation, I turned to my side, pillowed my head on my arms, looked at the side of his face. Faint light from window lightened half side of his face, leaving me the shadowy silhouette. He's so beautiful, elegant, like ancient Roman sculpture carefully carved out in marble, even in moments like this.

I looked at him so focused, I'm sure he realized my gaze, but he didn't look back, not at that moment before I speak. He was contemplating something, I think, but I would never know. I never asked.

"Castiel," I called him.

He turned to look at me immediately, a little too fast, a little alerted, concerning. He knew every time I call him "Castiel" instead of "Cass", something was not right. But he didn't ask what was wrong, just waited. He was always that patient, just waiting for me to talk, to move, to take the action. Sometimes even made me feel like he was some large predator, silent, patient, but deadly. But not now. Now he was just a man, like any human after the fierce satisfying movement, taking the time to slow down the breath, to calm down the impulsion of taking another bite. Because that's exactly what I was, something tasty for him to bite on. I knew it, and I knew he knew it.

"I have a confession to make." I said, enjoying observing the change of expression on his face -- his face, but mostly his eyes -- a little too much.

His eye brow frowned a little bit, the blue sea in his eyes seemed to have some shallow wave, but so subtle that I almost missed that. Is that concerning or worrying?

"I was a virgin before tonight." I told him the big secret and surprise I prepared for too long. But I guess it wasn't much of a secret actually. In the end, he's an angel. How can he not know it already.

"I know." He said, seemed a bit relieved, I think. But I can never really tell what each expression in his eyes represent. The blue sea was too deep for me to read, I can only try to imagine, to feel it, using more of my heart than my brain.

"You knew?" I was surprised, maybe, but deep down I guess I wasn't as surprised as I tried to sound like. There wasn't much thing that could really escape his notice, was it?

His lip curved tiny little bit, so quick and subtle that I almost thought I was imagining it.

"You knew what it means but you still did it? The power of virgin's blood?" I couldn't stop myself for speaking out my mind too quickly, or gazing at his angel wings, searching.

He didn't use to make his wings visible, not when he was walking on the earth. But I told him I loved it, "obsessed" might be a better word. Especially at the time of ascension, watching how each feather would tremble and glow when I held him tight and touched his spealbone, it would ignite me all too easily.

"That it would darken my wings? Yes." He nodded so casually as if he was just talking about tomorrow's weather or neighbor's dog.

There was no sign of darkness in his pure white wings yet, but for how long? When the shred of my blood spilled on him, something would never be the same again.

"You are willing to fall for me?" I would have said "in my lure", but now I realized it wasn't my lure that led him here, it never was. He came to my room, prepared, knowing what it means, and made his moves like the champion in the chess matches.

Now I'm certain he's smiling, almost laughing, but only showing that in the eyes. I had told him smile didn't really suit him, it made him look like ... I don't know look like what exactly but at least unlike him. But I could tell the glimmer was in his eyes now.

"Come here." He said, holding his arms. I couldn't resist huddling in his embrace, so warm and safe like nowhere else in the whole world (heaven and hell included).

"There was nothing else I would be willing to fall for." That was all he said, and that was all I ever needed.

But wouldn't that hurt? The burning of the wings in the holy fire until it became black? Broken maybe, so that he might fall and become a human, just like me? I was thinking them but never asked any, not like they matter, not like he would answer anything differently than what he already told me. That's more than enough for me.

I guess he didn't know the full power of virgin blood, actually, and I never intended to tell him: it bounded hearts together.
