> Dean: I feel great. Look, Uh...
>
> He turns and picks up his gun and looks back at Sam.
>
> Dean: This is a gun.
>
> He drops the gun back down and points to his coat.
>
> Dean: This is a coat.
>
> He walks over to the lamp in their room and gestures at it.
>
> Dean: <u>This is a...a...a...light stick.</u>
>
> Sam is startled at Dean being unable to remember the proper word.
>
> Sam: A light st-
>
> Sam turns to the desk and pulls out a sticky note pad. He writes something on it.
>
> Sam: All right. We're gonna get you some help.
>
> Dean: Look, we could figure this out, okay? <u>Don't go callin' Mom or Cass with this.</u>
>
> Sam pulls off the sticky note and stands up. He walks over to the lamp and puts the sticky note on it. It says Lamp.
>
> Sam: Fine, but until you get better...
>
> Dean looks at the note and snaps his fingers.
>
> Dean: Lamp. Right. So close.

> Dean in the bathroom. He is splashing his face with water and looking intently into the mirror at his reflection.
>
> Dean: Ahh. Okay. <u>My name is Dean Winchester. Sam is my brother. Uh, Mary Winchester is my mom. And Cast -- Cass is my best friend.</u>
>
> <u>He sighs and looks unsure about everything he just said.</u>

> Cut back to the bathroom where Dean is still staring intently into the mirror.
>
> Dean: My name is Dean Wi-Winchester.
>
> <u>He looks down as he realizes he barely remembers his name.</u> He looks up again to try again.
>
> Dean: My name -- My name is...
>
> <u>The fear on his face is visible as he doesn't remember his name.</u>
>
> Dean: My... My name is -- is...
>
> <u>He stares into the mirror completely disbelieving and lost.</u>

> Cut back to Dean in the bathroom, <u>still staring in fear at his reflection</u>.
>
> Dean: My... My... I don't know.

> Cut to the inside of the motel room where Dean is now standing restlessly inside of a circle while Rowena gathers things, apparently getting ready to do a spell. Dean keeps moving the items around. Rowena is getting annoyed with it.
>
> Rowena: Stop touching everything.
>
> Rowena takes a small bottle from him.
>
> Dean: Sorry.
>
> Dean spins around in a circle and when he faces the table again, he grabs the same bottle again. Rowena grabs it from him again and gives him a voodoo doll and some pins to play with while she does her spell work.
>
> Rowena: Ugh. Here. <u>Play with this, and I'll tell you a story.</u>
>
> Dean takes the doll and turns away from her.
>
> Dean: Okay.
>
> She continues what she was doing while talking to Dean. Dean is playing with the doll.
>
> Rowena: Once, a beautiful witch was, again, run out of her homeland by those pompous, self-righteous, murderous hooligans. You know them as the British Men of Letters.
>
> Dean looks over at her and nods slightly before turning back to the doll
>
> Dean: Hmm.
>
> Rowena: She sought refuge with a family of witches. All she wanted was a roof over her head and a safe place to hone her magic. Yet they threw her out like... like she was common trash. Said she wasn't up to snuff.
>
> Dean turns to look at Rowena again.
>
> Dean: <u>Oh, these witches sound like dicks. I think you got plenty of snuff.</u>
>
> Rowena seems surprised by his statement and laughs.
>
> Rowena: You can really remember nothing, can you? <u>What a gift not to recall the things you've done.</u>
>
> She looks away from Dean back down to the table with her things on it. Dean looks back over at her.
>
> Dean: What have I done?
>
> She stops and looks back up at Dean.
>
> Rowena: Oh, you're a killer, Dean Winchester.
>
> Dean seems unsure about this information.

> Cut back to Dean at the motel. He looks confusedly at Rowena.
>
> Dean: Wait, I... I kill people?
>
> Rowena: Scores.
>
> Rowena: <u>But... but... though you may be a stubborn pain in the arse with the manners of a Neanderthal and the dining habits of a toddler, everything you've done, you've done...</u>
>
> <u>She stops and makes a disgusted face behind Dean's back.</u>
>
> Rowena: <u>for the greater good.</u>
>
> Dean doesn't seem impressed by this.
>
> Dean: <u>Oh, and that's supposed to make it okay?</u>
>
> Rowena scoffs and turns away.
>
> Rowena: I wouldn't know. You help those other than yourself.
>
> She walks around behind Dean and stands beside him. Dean still looks unsure.
>
> Rowena: But me, <u>I've done horrible things, and I told myself it was fine. It was the price of power. And power's what matters, right?</u>
>
> Rowena looks as though she's trying to convince herself that what she's saying is true.
>
> Rowena: Then I met God and his sister.
>
> Dean gives her a "you met who" disbelieving look.
>
> Rowena: <u>The two most powerful beings in the universe, wasting it on squabbling with each other. I thought, if -- if they can't be happy, or at least satisfied, how can there be any hope for me?</u>
>
> Rowena looks at Dean as though she's hoping for an answer. Dean looks baffled as to what she wants him to say.
>
> Dean: Why are you telling me this?
>
> Rowena smiles at him.
>
> Rowena: <u>Because I know you won't remember.</u>
>
> She taps him on the nose with her finger and walks back around the table as her cellphone rings.

> Scene opens at dusk with Dean just waking up in the passenger side of the Impala.
>
> Dean: Hmm?
>
> He groggily looks around the car. And notices a note stuck to the windshield in front of him.  He takes it down and reads it.
>
> Dean: "Your brother's been kidnapped by a witch. I found your stupid car and left you here." Stupid?
>
> <u>Dean looks around the car, and is about to open the door and get out. He sees another note on the passenger side window.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>"Stay."</u>
>
> <u>He makes a face and leans back into the seat.</u>

> Cut to Dean out in the Impala. <u>He looks again at the note saying "Stay" , takes it down and decides to ignore it. He gets out and opens the trunk, where he finds another note saying "Open Me". He opens the hidden compartment in the trunk and finds all the weapons, his gaze immediately falling on a very large gun. On the gun is a note saying "NO". He sighs and keeps looking. He sees another note that says "witch-killing bullets" and one last note that says "This Gun".</u>

> She bends down and picks up another shard. She stands up to inspect it. She is about to throw it at Rowena when she hears the sound of a gun cocking. She turns and sees Dean standing there with a gun pointed at her. She seems to think Dean is an idiot for trying to shoot her with a gun. She laughs.
>
> Cat: A gun? You really think that's gonna work on a...
>
> <u>Dean holds up the note that says "witch-killing bullets".</u> Cat just scoffs and turns away. Dean shoots her and she goes down. Rowena falls to the floor. Boyd and Sam are both startled by the gunshot. Sam gets his hands free and throws himself at Boyd knocking the knife out of Boyd's hand. He punches Boyd, knocking him further away and picks up the knife. Boyd makes the knife too hot for Sam to hold and he drops it again.
>
> Sam: Aah!
>
> Boyd runs out of the room and down the stairs, Sam follows. Dean sees them coming down the stairs and aims his gun at them. Boyd freezes on the landing, Sam freezes a few stairs up. <u>Dean is confused as to who he should shoot. He points the gun at Sam.</u>
>
> Sam: <u>No, no, no. Brother (points to himself). Witch (points to Boyd).</u>
>
> <u>Dean trusts him and shoots Boyd, who goes down. Sam looks extremely relieved. Dean looks quite proud of himself and gives Sam a thumbs up.</u>

<br>

> Scene opens to Sam waiting impatiently in the foyer. There is a flash of purple light at the top of the stairs. We can hear Rowena saying a spell. Rowena and Dean emerge from the room and start walking down the stairs. <u>Sam looks anxiously up at them.</u>
>
> Sam: Hey. Is that it? Is -- is it done?
>
> Dean: <u>Who's this hippie?</u>
>
> <u>Sam looks horrified that Dean doesn't recognize him.</u> After a few moments Dean and Rowena chuckle.
>
> Dean: Look at his face. Oh! Kind of like the time when I ate all your Halloween candy. You remember that? Classic.
>
> <u>Sam is not amused by Dean's joke. He shakes his head and half-smiles.</u>
>
> Sam: Not funny.

> Crowley: Oh, you'll resist, at first. But the humiliation will eat at you. Until, finally, you're worn down by your utter helplessness. <u>And you call me... Master.</u> (inhales sharply) You brag of your superior power. Well, genius trumps brute force. I've had a dozen of my most loyal studying the cage where you were held at the molecular level. They managed to replicate the material. They made those chains. Getting you here... well, that was a different matter.

> Crowley: I managed to pervert that spell. So your essence wasn't sent back to the cage, but instead, we found your discarded vessel a few years ago... repaired it, improved it, making it a fitting final home for the real you. What? No snarky, devilish comments? You have nothing to say?
>
> Lucifer: Thanks? I mean, all that effort. So you could've had me back in the cage, but no, you needed your sad, little revenge. How do you think this is going to end? Nice new digs, by the way. Cozy.

> Lucifer is laughing.
>
> Lucifer: Ah. Ohh. Oh, sorry, it's just that...Ah. Y-you -- you actually... you seriously think this is gonna work? It's just, uh... It's so sad.
>
> <u>Crowley drags Lucifer out of the chair and dumps him on the floor.</u>
>
> Crowley: <u>Hope you like the taste of floor.</u>
>
> Lucifer: Ow.
>
> Crowley: <u>There's a spot there needs scrubbing.</u>
>
> Lucifer: And worse, you're not even gonna see it comin' when you get taken down.

> Rowena: Hello, Gavin. <u>You look just like my father when he was young.</u>
>
> Sam: Gavin, meet Rowena, your grandmother.
>
> Gavin: My grandmother? She cannae be alive.
>
> Dean: Well, technically, dude, neither can you.

> Gavin: I bought it myself. It was a gift for my Fiona.

> Rowena: <u>Darlin', you had a wee girlfriend?</u>

> Sam: Actually, there might be a-a way to fix pretty much everything.
>
> Gavin: What?
>
> Dean: Keep Fiona from going Casper in the first place.
>
> Sam: Yeah. There's no reason for her to be a ghost if she's not angry and alone... on the ship.
>
> Rowena: You don't intend to tamper with the flow of time do you?
>
> Dean: That's up to Gavin. Look, we're lookin' for a fix here, okay? This is it. We get him aboard that ship, he travels with Fiona, keeps her safe.
>
> Rowena: <u>And go to his death. That's your solution?</u>
>
> Dean: I didn't say it was the fun one, okay? Just the one, and you know it. And it would keep history intact.
>
> Gavin: I... was thinking the same thing. I loved her. She loved me. That's the only reason any of this happened. I can spare her the nightmare she's trapped in. I cannae say I ever fit here. Here, I'm alone. Fiona and me, we'll spend eternity together.

> Crowley: <u>Never gonna happen.</u>

> the camera pans to show Crowley standing behind Gavin.
>
> Crowley: <u>Just 'cause Dim and Dimmer here can't keep their own family all in the same dimension, doesn't mean they can mess with mine!</u>
>
> Gavin: Father, I want to do this.
>
> Crowley: <u>What you want is a gym membership, happy hour at Hooters, and Cubs tickets -- none of which are available anywhere else but here.</u>
>
> Gavin: I've made up my mind.
>
> Crowley: <u>Then why did you call me?</u>
>
> Dean: You called him?
>
> Gavin: To say goodbye.
>
> Rowena: Let him go, Fergus.
>
> Crowley: <u>Butt out.</u>
>
> Rowena: Fergus, he's not like us. He believes in things. Let him do what he believes is right.
>
> Gavin stands and Crowley reaches for him.
>
> Rowena: Manete!
>
> Crowley is frozen in place.
>
> Crowley: <u>Mother... Damn you.</u>
>
> Gavin: I'm sorry, Father.
>
> They walk out leaving Crowley behind.

>
> Gavin is sitting off to the side, Rowena standing beside him.
>
> Rowena: The pigs, in particular, hated your father. He'd go in to feed them, and they'd head-butt him into the mud *every* time!
>
> Gavin laughs.
>
> Gavin: And... What was he like when he got to be my age?
>
> Rowena: Uh, to be honest, I'm not sure. I was forced to leave, you see.
>
> Gavin: Oh. That's too bad. L-Left him with his father, did you?
>
> Rowena: Well...
>
> Gavin: <u>You left him alone?!</u>
>
> Rowena: He was eight, he seemed very enterprising.
>
> Gavin scoffs.
>
> Rowena: You must understand, Gavin, we were stinking poor. And when I say "stinking"... One way or the other, I made up my mind to have a life. At a time when very few women did.
>
> Gavin: What, that when you became a witch?
>
> Rowena: (proudly) And talented, I was. Which didn't sit well with the locals, so... (sighs)
>
> Gavin: <u>He drank himself to death, you know. I buried him. Fergus, I mean. Not the Crowley he became. I never knew I had family. He barely mentioned you.</u>
>
> Rowena: I'm sorry I didn't know you then. But here we are now. Strangely, here we all are.
>
> Gavin: <u>Well, he's not so bad, Crowley.</u>
>
> Rowena: Hmm?
>
> Gavin: <u>He comes to see me from time to time. He gave me money to live, until I got hired at the Gas-N-Sip.</u>
>
> Rowena: He never told me that.

> Crowley: What you did... A low, even for you. Wasn't right.
>
> Rowena: (laughs) And you would know what's right?
>
> Crowley: I know there's an ugly, rancid, spiteful reason why you sent my son, your grandson, to his death. I wanna know what it is.

> Rowena: He was a lovely boy. And in your own lizard way, I know you cared for him. just as I cared for Oskar.

> Crowley: Oskar.

> Rowena: The child I loved more than you. The boy you made me kill in order to remove the Mark of Cain.
>
> Flashback to when Rowena killed Oskar.

> Crowley: So that was all drivel you were spewing about Gavin doing the right thing.
>
> Rowena: <u>It was the right thing. Maybe for Gavin, certainly for me. It allowed me to watch you suffer the loss of a child.</u>

> Crowley: Payback.

> Rowena walks over and gets on a bus. The rolling stones' "Playing With Fire" begins to play.

> The Impala pulls in front of the "Wild Elk Lodge". Sam, Dean and Mick get out of the car.
>
> Sam: This place, uh, seems a little...
>
> Mick: <u>Shabby? Yeah. Three stars was the best I could do. Least our bean counters will be happy. Booked us all suites.</u>
>
> Sam: <u>Wait, you... We're in separate rooms?</u>
>
> Mick: Yeah, of course.
>
> Dean: You say three stars?
>
> Mick: Yeah.
>
> Dean: <u>So we're talking fresh towels, little baby shampoos?</u>
>
> Mick: <u>Uh-huh. And I believe there's a pool.</u>

> The following morning Sam and Dean exit the hotel and stand outside.
>
> Dean: (to the bellman) Thanks. <u>(to Sam) Man. Those pillows, right? The little chocolates that they put on? I mean, I'm ruined, Sam. Those limey sons of bitches ruined me. I even took a swim this morning.</u>
>
> Sam: You brought a swimsuit?
>
> Dean: No.
>
> Sam: Ugh.
>
> Dean: What'd you get up to?
>
> Sam: I read through more of Mick's lore books.
>
> Dean: Really? Wow. Those three stars are wasted on you.

> Mick: Plasma therapy. Useless, I'm afraid. So how were your accommodations, lads?
>
> The Impala's engine is heard purring as the valet pulls up to the front of the hotel.
>
> Dean: I've had better night's sleep in my baby. (engine idling) Get in. Let's go.
>
> Dean leans over to Sam as Mick gets in the car.
>
> Dean: <u>Not gonna give him the satisfaction.</u>

> Scene changes to Claire looking out the hotel window as the full moon rises from behind the clouds. Animal calls can be heard. Mick sits down in a chair and fills a syringe with liquid from a bottle.
>
> Mick: Let's give it time.
>
> Claire is breathing heavily. She grabs her stomach and bends over in pain.
>
> Claire: Aah! It burns!
>
> Claire grabs at her shoulder. She goes to the mirror and pulls off her bandage. As she turns to see the wound, it starts to disappear. She turns around and moves toward a gun on the table. Mick sees her and grabs it before she can.

> Mick: No.

>
> Mick points the gun at her.

> Mick: I know a man who would shoot you right now without a moment's thought. And every instinct I have says he's right... that I ought to do my duty. (Flashback to Hayden laying on the floor in the hospital, gasping. Mick looks on as she dies.) <u>But... But my instincts haven't been so grand of late.</u> (sighs) Sit down.
>
> Claire wraps herself in a blanket and sits on the couch, hugging her knees.
>
> Mick: Now okay, here's what we're gonna do. Firstly, we're gonna restrain you, right? (Mick picks up leather straps) For my protection. Okay? And then...then we're gonna sedate you. (Mick holds up a small brown bottle) Also for my protection. With any luck, when you wake up, this will all be over.

> Dr Hess: Are you about to tell me that you are doing the best that you can? Two days ago, according to your own report, you let a Prince of Hell escape and the mother of Lucifer's child. And one of my best men was murdered by an American Hunter, whom you allowed to live.
>
> Mick: If I might...
>
> Dr Hess: These Hunters are out of control. The brothers Winchester, in particular, which Lady Bevell has exhaustively documented.
>
> Mick: Ma'am, if... if you could just listen...
>
> Dr Hess: To what? More excuses? No. I don't think I will. Hunters are dogs, Mr. Davies. You give them an order, and they obey. That's how it works. So tell me, do they? Do they obey you?
>
> Mick doesn't answer. He looks at Ketch, but doesn't get any assistance from him.
>
> Dr Hess: No. Of course not. So... this Eileen Leahy will be found and killed in accordance with the Code. As for the Winchesters, like any rebellious Hunter, they will be investigated. And, if found guilty, executed.
>
> Mick: <u>If they're found guilty? Aren't Hunters always found guilty?</u>
>
> Dr Hess: Be careful, Mr. Davies.
>
> Mick: <u>No. My entire life with the Men of Letters, I never broke a rule. And yes, at first I was shocked at how Sam and Dean operate. But what Lady Bevell doesn't mention is the lives they've saved, monsters destroyed, and outcomes made better not because of the Code, but because of Sam and Dean Winchester's sense of what's right.</u>
>
> Dr Hess: And that is the crux of the matter. The Code is not a suggestion. It's an absolute. The Code is what separates us from the monsters. It is the order by which we all live.
>
> Mick: <u>No. The code is what makes a young boy kill his best friend. When I was a child, I had nothing. I owed you everything, and I obeyed. But I'm a man now, Dr. Hess...</u>
>
> Dr Hess nods discreetly to Ketch.
>
> Mick: <u>...and I can see the choices, and I choose to do the right thing.</u>
>
> Ketch shots Mick in the back of the head. He dies immediately, his blood seeping across the table.
>
> Dr Hess nods to Ketch again, and he acknowledges by nodding back.

> Dean: (dejectedly) Yeah. <u>You know, it wasn't long ago, I thought we had it made. We saved the world. We got Cass back. We had Mom back. I mean, it wasn't perfect, but still, we had 'em. And now...</u>
>
> Sam: Now they're all gone. And Mom, what they did to her... (scoffs) I just fell for their company line. (emotionally) Man, I... (inhales deeply, exhales sharply) I saw what they were doing, and I -- and I thought, hunters on that scale, working together... how much good we can do. And once I was in, I... I just followed. 'Cause it was easy. Easier.

> Walt: You gonna tell us what we're doing here or what?
>
> Sam: Ah. Of course. Yeah. Um, so my - my brother and I, we - we, um... (sighs) No, you know what? I called you here because people... um, our people, are being slaughtered. And we're next. The British Men of Letters, they came here because they thought they could do our job better than we could. And they hooked us with their flashy gear and their tech. Most of you had the good sense to turn 'em down. I didn't. They said they wanted the same thing we wanted, you know? A world free of monsters. That's not what they really wanted. They want control. They want to live in a world where they can sit in some office and decide who gets to live and who gets to die. And they've killed people. They've killed innocent people just because they got in the way. They think the ends justify the means. But we know better. We know hunting isn't just about killing. It's about doing what's right, even when it's hard. So we go by our gut, right?
>
> As Sam speaks passionately, then scene pans around the room as the hunters listen.
>
> Sam: We play by our own rules, and that scares them. That's why they want us dead, 'cause we're the one thing they can't control.
>
> Roy: So what do you want from us?
>
> Sam: <u>I want you to follow me.</u> Take the fight to them. To hit them before they hit us. We go in fast and hard and we fight and we beat them down until they give up or until they're dead. Look, they're well-trained and well-armed. Some of us might not make it back. But we will win. We will take down the bad guys because that's what we do. <u>They're scared of us. Yeah. Good. They should be.</u>
