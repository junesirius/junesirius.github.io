> Sam: You okay?
>
> Dean: <u>No. Sam, I'm not okay. I'm pretty far from okay. You know, my whole life, I always believed that what we do was important. No matter what the cost, no matter who we lost, whether it was Dad or -- or Bobby or... And I would take the hit. But I kept on fighting because I believed that we were making the world a better place. And now Mom and Cass... And I - I don't know. I don't know.</u>
>
> Sam: <u>So now you don't believe anymore.</u>
>
> Dean: I just need a win. I just need a damn win.
>
> Dean and Sam get into Baby, start the engine up and exit the crime scene. We see Baby cruising along a highway under a bright, clear sky.

> Nighttime shot of Baby traveling on a backroad highway. A cell phone rings, waking Sam. Dean answers.
>
> Dean: Yeah. <u>(Dean looks dumbfoundedly at Sam)</u>
>
> Sam: What?
>
> <u>Baby is driving down a narrow back street. Dean stops and shuts off the car. A figure can barely be seen in the shadows. They boys exit the car. As they approach the figure standing next to a payphone, he turns to reveal it is Cass.</u>

> <u>Sam and Dean stand beside the Impala, and Cass is waiting for them by the phone booth.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Cass, is that really you?</u>
>
> Sam: No. You're - you're dead.
>
> Castiel: Yeah, I was. But then I... annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that he sent me back.
>
> Sam: I don't even know what to say.
>
> Dean: I do. <u>Welcome home, pal.</u>
>
> <u>Dean embraces Cass, and then Sam hugs Cass.</u>
>
> Castiel: How long was I gone?
>
> Dean: <u>Too damn long.</u>
>
> Sam: Where were you? In Heaven?
>
> Castiel: No. No, I was in the Empty.
>
> Dean: Really?
>
> Castiel: Apparently, it's where angels and demons go when they die.
>
> Sam: What was it like?
>
> Castiel: Well, it's dark and... nothing.
>
> We see scenes from 13.04, of Cass's experiences in the Empty.
>
> Castiel: It's like... nothing. I was sleeping, and then I heard a voice that said my name, and I woke up. I thought you... had done something.
>
> Dean: No, we... we didn't even think we could bring you back.
>
> Sam: So who was it? Chuck - uh, God?
>
> Castiel: No. No, he has no power in the Empty.
>
> Dean: Well, then, who does?
>
> Sam: Jack.

> Castiel: Hello, Jack.
>
> Jack: Castiel?
>
> Castiel: (sighs) Yeah, it's me.
>
> Jack: No. We burned your body, and what's burned stays dead. How...
>
> Dean: Well, that's the question we've been askin'.
>
> Sam: Jack... did you, uh... Did you bring Cass back?
>
> Jack: <u>I don't know. I wanted him back. I... begged for him to come back, but...</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Well, here he is.</u>
>
> Jack: Because of me?
>
> Sam: We don't know. We don't know, Jack. But we- we- we think maybe.
>
> Castiel: <u>Thank you, Jack.</u>
>
> <u>Jack walks over to Cass and hugs him, while Dean stands at the opposite end of the table looking on.</u>
>
> Jack: <u>I missed you so much.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Sam and Dean tell me you're doing well.</u>
>
> Jack: I am. I... Watch this.
>
> Jack walks back to the table and levitates a pencil for a few seconds, then chuckles.
>
> Sam: Wow.
>
> Jack: I can move the pencil. And... I found a case. Hunter's case.
>
> Dean: What kind of a --
>
> Jack: <u>Zombies. (he whispers confidentially to Cass) I know what zombies are now.</u> (he pulls the came info up on the computer) You see?
>
> Dean: <u>Wait. Where'd you learn to do that?</u>
>
> Jack: <u>By watching you. And Sam.</u> Three days ago, a vintage pocket watch with a personal inscription was sold at a pawn shop. But when they went to authenticate it, they found out that it'd been buried with its owner... 20 years ago. And when they checked out the grave, it was empty. Which means... <u>the dead are rising in Dodge City, Kansas.</u>
>
> <u>♪ Cowboy music plays as a dreamy expression crosses Dean's face. Cass glances up as if he heard the music as well, and Dean looks down to hide his smile... Jack glances between the two of them, confused.</u>
>
> Sam: Right. O-or maybe it's a-a grave robbery, but...
>
> Jack: Oh.
>
> Dean: Yeah, but we should probably check it out.
>
> Castiel: Wait. Really?
>
> Dean: Yeah, we've done more on less. Besides Dodge City's kind of, uh, kind of awesome. All right, well... <u>two salty hunters, one half-angel kid, and a dude who just came back from the dead. Again. Team Free Will 2.0. Here we go.</u>

> At the Stampede Motel in Dodge City, TFW 2.0 finds their room.
>
> Dean: All right, this is supposed to be the best room in the joint.
>
> Dean unlocks the door, and switches on the light.
>
> Dean: Oh, ho! The Wild Bill suite.
>
> Dean laughs as he looks around at all the cowboy decor, horse paintings, horns, antlers, animal heads, and photos of famous old west figures.
>
> Sam: Wow.
>
> <u>Sam, Castiel, and Jack are more bewildered than impressed, but Dean's having the time of his life.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Pretty cool, right? Dude! Check it out, check it out, check it out. Clay Allison - gun fighter extraordinaire, right? And, uh, Curly Bill Brocius, which - now, now, now, little fun fact here - was killed by Wyatt Earp himself. Not kidding. Johnny Ringo, Billy the Kid. Oh, look!</u>
>
> Jack: (in an aside to Castiel) He really likes cowboys.
>
> Dean: (boops a stuffed buffalo head on the nose) Hey, big guy. How you doin'? That's... What's going on, Calamity Jane?
>
> Castiel: (to Jack) <u>Yes. Yes, he does.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Doc Holliday! Hey-oh! This is awesome.</u> All right, I say quick shower, steak dinner, and then tomorrow, we hit up the cemetery.
>
> Sam: Sounds like a plan.
>
> A set of swinging saloon doors creak as Dean goes to the bedroom and we hear him call out from the next room.
>
> Dean: <u>Oh, yes! Stirrup hangers!</u>

> Dean and Castiel drive up to the crime scene along the highway where Carl was killed and park a short distance away. They remain in the car, Castiel wearing a cowboy hat with a hat band advertising their motel, and discuss their strategy.
>
> Dean: All right, listen, these Dodge City cops aren't likely to trust big city folks, so we're gonna have to blend.
>
> Castiel: <u>Which is why you're making me wear this absurd hat.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>It's not that bad. Well, actually, yeah, it kind of is. Hang on. (Dean reaches over and removes the hat band and tosses it in the back seat) All right. That's better.</u>
>
> Castiel: Is it?
>
> Dean: (sighs) Yeah. Look, just act like you're from *Tombstone*, okay?
>
> Castiel: The city?
>
> Dean: <u>The movie. With Kurt Russell? I made you watch it.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. The one with the guns and tuberculosis. (in a deep cowboy voice) "I'm your Huckleberry."</u>
>
> Dean: Yeah, exactly. Well, <u>it's good to have you back, Cass.</u> All right, follow my lead. We'll fit right in.

> Rain falls and thunder rumbles as Sam drives Castiel and Jack back to the bunker in the Impala.
>
> Sam: Jack, you, uh... you okay?
>
> Castiel: <u>Jack, I've killed people who didn't deserve it... my friends -- I've killed people I loved. I wish I could tell you that it -- that it gets easier, that with time, it hurts less, but that would be a lie because it -- it never gets easier. And those moments, they never stop hurting. But that doesn't mean that you should stop fighting. Doesn't mean that just because you made a mistake -- and that's what this is, Jack. It's a mistake. That doesn't mean that you can't -- can't be better, do better. I believe that. I have to believe that.</u>
>
> Sam: And we still believe in you, Jack. We, uh --
>
> Jack: Stop. Just... Please stop.

> Dean arrives back in the bunker, where Jack's sitting at the library table alone and contemplative. Sam sits at the war room table across from Castiel.
>
> Sam: Hey.
>
> Dean: Hey.
>
> Sam: How'd it go?
>
> Dean: Usual. Killed the bad guy, saved the girl.
>
> Sam: What about the, uh...
>
> Dean: <u>Took care of it.</u>
>
> Sam: Good.
>
> Jack: <u>Good? How is that good? I killed someone. What was his name? The guard? Did he have a family?</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Jack, don't do this to yourself.</u>
>
> Jack: No, did he?
>
> Dean: Yes, he did.
>
> Sam: Jack, look, this life, what we do, it's... it's not easy. And we've all done things we regret.
>
> Jack: <u>Just don't. (Sam steps back and raises palms trying to calm him) You're afraid of me.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Jack, no.</u>
>
> Jack: No, maybe you're right. Maybe I'm just another monster.
>
> Dean: <u>No, you're not.</u> I thought you were. I did. But... <u>Like Sam said, we've all done bad. We all have blood on our hands. So if you're a monster, we're all monsters.</u>
>
> Jack: No, you don't... <u>Every time I try and do something good, people get hurt. I thought I was getting better. I'm not... I don't know what I am, but I know I can't make the world a better place, not like this. I can't even do one good thing. And I know that if I stay, I'm gonna hurt you. All of you. And... I can't. You're all I have.</u>
>
> Sam: Jack, listen...
>
> Jack: I have to go.
>
> Castiel: <u>No, Jack.</u>
>
> Jack: <u>I'm sorry.</u>
>
> Jack uses his power to knock Sam, Dean, and Castiel backward across the war room. His eyes glow golden.
>
> Jack: <u>I'm so sorry.</u>
>
> Jack disappears with a woosh.
>
> Castiel: <u>Jack.</u>
>
> Sam: Hey.
>
> Sam and Castiel get to their feet and look around for Jack.
>
> Castiel: <u>Jack!</u>
>
> Sam: He's gone.
