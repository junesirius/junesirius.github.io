"Oh my god! Oh my god!" Genevieve cries out, high-pitched voice shrieking and trembling, "Misha is dead!"

Jensen and Jared stare at her.

Jared reacts first, bursting out into a laughter, "That is good. Really good, Gen, you almost got me."

Jensen relaxes a little too, faint smile starting to show at the corner of the tightened lip line. "Yeah, almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack good." he gives her a thumb up, "Bob would love to see it tomorrow, great delivery of the line."

Genevieve stares at both of them, unbelievable and torn-apart, "What?! No! Fuck the line, Misha is really dead!"

<br>

Misha is really, actually, factually, unmistakably, dead.

Jensen looks through the hospital window, buzzing sound is still ringing inside his head. Misha's lifeless body still lays on the white-sheet bed. They didn't cover his face yet. He can still see his face, the remnant of terror lingers on it. Jensen is more or less glad at least the doctors closed his eyes. He doesn't want to see how those beautiful big blue eyes have become now.

The ambulance arrived too late, the medicals said by the time they arrived, he's already long gone. The police found one witness, the homeless hiding by the corner. His words don't make any sense, and the police never found the guy in description.

But they know what happened.

Everything is happening just like the script. The show they're filming is real. The other world where angels and demons and hunters and Winchesters are fighting their big wars are real. But Jensen is so pissed, he doesn't really care what's happening in whatever other universes, but they don't get to drop in to this world and kill Misha and disappear.

And Misha is not the only one.

Bullets in the chest, Eric and Bob also ended up becoming cold bodies, black-and-white photos on the table when guests are just walking around, drinking wines, and chatting about nonsense. They made an appearance on the Variety too, all three of them, the title being "Is *Supernatural* really supernatural?"

Nothing advertise better than tragedies. Especially the ones that make to the front page.

More funds and interests flood into the show, and more audience.

Jensen doesn't care about any of those shit. Misha is dead. Nothing matters.

<br>

"How' you holding up?" Jim asks him.

The father figure in the show is also almost like a father figure on the set. Jensen pays him great respect. He nods and says, "I'm ok." In the calmest voice he can manage.

"No you're not." his Bobby studies his face, "You haven't speak with anyone unless spoken to. It's not like to be so quiet. Want to talk?"

Jensen briefly looks up, meets the concerning eyes, smiles a bitter smile in appreciation, "Not really. Thanks anyway."

"You know, you really are one-hundred-percent Dean." Jim comments, "Especially in moments like this."

"What can I say," Jensen answers, spreads his hands, "guess they found the best dude for the job."

Jim is silent for a moment, Jensen knows his eyes remains on him but he just pretends to be looking at something else. Jim gives up, pats twice on his shoulder quickly, saying, "Well anyhow, just know that whatever you need, we're here."

A tiny nod is all that shows Jensen heard him.

But what he needs, Jim can't give. Nobody can.

He needs Misha alive.

And now, this world is not making sense, but none of the cast or crew seem to be noticing. Buy you don't get to play the best hunter in the world - even if it's not *your* world - without picking up a trick or two. Call it instinct or foolishness, whatever you want, Jensen is not going to just sit around, living in a world without Misha, knowing that it's angels from another world that killed him.

Jensen has a plan. He is going to do what he has been doing for about five years now - hunting. And maybe, if he's lucky, he's going to bring Misha back to life.

<br>

"No, listen, you're not making sense. You are cra - you need help. That's all." Jared stares at him, stepping back one or two steps, as if Jensen is menacing him with a dagger or gun, not just holding up a piece of parchment with Latin spells and sigils on it. "You do know magic is not real, and the show is just a show, right?"

"No! That's exactly what I'm trying to say." Jensen barks back, equally pissed and frustrated, "IT'S. ALL. REAL. How else would you explain their deaths? Huh? Or the missing so-called extra after dropping three bodies? Or... or, did you check your credit cards?"

"What?" Jared squints his eyes.

"Your black credit card, the one Sam and Dean maxed out buying the bone of saint and whatever. Everything in the script happened, that must happened too." Jensen reasons.

Jared stutters, "I... I must ordered it when I was drunk or something. Or maybe it's Gen, I'll ask her."

Jensen raises one eyebrow. "So it's true. Come on! I thought you believe in facts."

"I don't know what to believe now." Jared frowns just like Sam would, "Maybe just a lot of coincident, alright? Believing the supernatural world is real and we are just living in one of its alternate? That's just too much nuts. I'm an actor, alright? Not hunter or witch or whatever cracky thing you're thinking about."

Jensen just looks at him, sad like a puppy in the rain. "You are not Sam." He says, in a low mumbling voice.

"And you are not Dean." Jared replies, waves a rough gesture of goodbye, leaving behind a "Get some rest" and leaves.

Looks like he's on his own on this now, Jensen thinks to himself. Dean needs his brother, but he is not Dean, so he can do it alone. No problem.

"You're really not very observant, aren't you?" When Mark's voice sounds up from around the corner, it almost gives Jensen a jump.

The king of hell's real world representative - the crafty demon, not the devil - walks into the light.

"Meaning?" Jensen snaps.

"Meaning if he admits you're right, then his wife had had sex with a tricky troubled half-demon hunter from another universe that happened to be wearing the same face as his." Mark states, in a matter-of-fact tone, as if explaining an easy math problem to a first-grade, "Well, does that count as a cheat? That's sort of a philosophical question, inn't it?"

Jensen scratches his head, "Son of a bitch."

Seconds later, he looks up again, questions the demon on set, "But you do, don't you? You have no conflict of interest, and you see all the evidences. Come on, it has to be real."

Mark studies his face, and slowly, he spits out one single syllable in perfect British tongue, "No."

"'No.'" Jensen repeats, mimics his tone, "No? What are you, blind?"

Mark holds out one finger, pointing at a random direction just to help making a point, and corrects himself, "No I mean, yes I believe, but no I won't help you bring Misha back."

"Why?" Jensen demands.

"Because." Mark uses Crowley's usual calm business voice, "Because." As if that word alone already states his points.

Jensen shoots him a shattered disappointed look. "Fine."

<br>

The show doesn't just teach him how to be a better actor, it turns out it also did a fairly good job to prepare him to be a good hunter.

And Jensen already knows by heart that the first step of working a (hunting) job, is to do the research, and know what you're dealing with. In this case, angels from a different universe.

He spends all his time when he's not acting on the research. Anything he can find, spells, witchcrafts, legends, lore, about how to travel between worlds, about how to reach gods and angels, about resurrection. Basically, just about anything supernatural.

He thought about quitting acting completely, doing this one thing important to him full-time. He actually did. Went straight to Sera - who picked up what Eric and Bob left behind and became the new boss that runs everything - and said he's done.

Sera looked him into the eyes, and asked, "Is this what Misha would want?"

Jensen hated when anyone talk to him like that, as if they are some divine power or know-it-all, he snarled and glared back, "You know what Misha would want? Not dead!"

"Jensen," Sera's voice got softer, "I understand..."

"No you don't." Jensen cut her off.

Sera continued as if not interrupted, "I understand you want him back, I want him back too. Hell, I'm the one who have to decide whether to kill Castiel or ask screenwriters to come up with a explanation why he had to suddenly change a vessel. But trust me, I understand. It's just that, I need you, and you need me."

"Sister I assure you..." Jensen started.

"Because the script is the only thing, the very first-hand source you get right now, about what's happening in the other world. That is, if you still believe what is in the show is what is in the other world." That, kept Jensen in total silence for ten full minutes. And after that, a signature on his contract.

The show keeps going after that. And Jensen's life is split equally between acting and lore-digging.

<br>

He tried prayer too.

Just like when Sam came back to Earth after jumping into the Cage with Lucifer, this is the first and second and third thing he tried.

Jensen prays to Castiel, days and nights, desperately, painfully, full-heartedly, repeatedly. And when there is never any answer or signal shows the prayer reaches a different universe, the prayers become curses. But Jensen keeps sending them, like a man on isolated island doesn't dare to let the fire and smoke out, just in case any ship passing by might miss his distress call when he's asleep.

This is exactly what those prayer-slash-curses are, distress calls.

"Cass, you son of a bitch," Jensen thinks loudly, "Misha died for your bullshitting great cause and grand plan. The least you can do is to pop in and bring him back. Don't say this world isn't yours so you don't care. Don't be a dick. Please! I'm begging you!"

His heart always bleeds hard at those moments, as if he has to watch Misha bleeds out by the stabbing wound in front of him all over again. And again. And again.

Jensen figures if the angels can come and go once, there is no reason why they can't do it twice. But none of them come back again, not Cass, not any of the other douchebag angels.

It would have been a good thing in any other circumstances, but not when he really, really need to get on hold of one of them.

Jensen also considers the possibility of Cass may be dead in the other world. That could explain why he can't come by. But Sera writes Cass back to the show, so if it means anything, he has to believe Cass is still there, and maybe, just maybe, there is the tiniest chance his soul-phone signal could reach that far.

For that tiniest possibility, he even endures watching the new guy acting as Cass's new vessel, playing the role and saying the lines that should have been Misha's. Everything is just so wrong.

<br>

Days and years passes by. Time doesn't mean anything now. Nothing does.

Jensen buries himself in acting and experimenting whatever new spells he can find. He has been to all the oldest archaeological sites, looking for any mysterious drawings and languages no one can recognize. His house can be used as the shooting set for man of letters bunker library just as is. He probably knows more about any ancient language than any other human being on Earth.

But nothing helps. Angels didn't come. The dead remains dead.

Jensen has moved the ring from left ring finger to the right ring finger. Some closest friends noticed. Their look would fall on the ring finger, shoot him a question look, receive a "don't ask" look in return, and look away with a sigh.

They never publicize their relationship - or friendship, if people prefer that term - but they're close, so close that none of the social term could define, not marriage, not boyfriend, not anything. So in the end, they would still land on "friend" - the friend whose existence could pin you to the ground, the friend whose loss would make your lung ache like all the air has been taken away, the friend that you would do anything to save them, even if it means to tear the universe apart.

But even the torn-apart universe doesn't seem to know where the missing person is.

"This is a magic-free zone." He remembers the line. He remembers every single line from the show ever since, just to not miss out any information about that world and this one.

There is no monster, no angel, no demon, no hunter in this world. Does that mean there is also no god, no heaven, no hell? And does that, mean there is no soul too? Then where does all the people go when they die? Do they just disappear? Cease to exist? They have to go somewhere, right? Magic-free, not belief-free. And books says, if you have belief, you could go somewhere. They still have Bible and Revelation, for gods' sake.

This line of thought always keeps Jensen's chest tight, aching so much that he fears he won't be able to catch his next breath and he might just die. But maybe, when that happen, he could reunite with Misha? Then even death doesn't seem so terrifying now.

But the real death never arrives in front of him, just as absent as everything else he wants to find. Just pain, the endless emptiness in his chest, the big hole that nothing could fit, the bleeding pain as if his chest is cut in half and he is just a walking dead.

And many times, when he wakes up to the day light, he would be so surprised that he is still alive, it almost seems to be a bad joke. Who says this world doesn't have hell, there is one right here for him, day in and day out.

<br>

Ten years. A complete decade slips through. Jensen looks at the calendar. This is February 25, 2021. Ten damn full years since Misha was gone.

Jensen pours himself a full glass of Whiskey, standing in front of Misha's grave, staring at the carvings of his name.

"I hate you, you know that, Misha?" He says, voice hoarse, eyes dry and sore, tears already drained in the past decade, "If I never met you, the life would be so much easier."

He sits down, pours a second glass, puts it in front of Misha's tombstone, as if offering a ghost made of air to drink with him.

The show had the finale last year, just a few months ago, now he doesn't even have to go to the set any more. Without that forced routine to walk outside and meet real people, this is the only place he still goes: to spend some time talking to the invisible spirit everyday.

When he saw the Dean he performed, the Dean in the other universe died and went to heaven, Jensen actually felt a sense of relief. He knows Dean like he knows his own brother. They've been together for fifteen freaking years, for better or for worse, he's glad at least one of them can find some peace.

"The show is finished," Jensen tells Misha's tombstone, drinking from his glass, "everyone waves at the camera and all that, I was just thinking, man, how I wish you were there too."

"Jack became the new God. I still haven't figured out the rule of the multi-verse, if he would be able to come here or pull something big. If he can, I hope he can, then maybe we can get this fixed too, you know?" his voice cracks and chokes.

"I can." The young God's voice echoes behind him, sounds exactly like that kid Alex.

Jensen stirs around so quickly that his head spins dizzy.

Jack stands there behind him. Next to him, Castiel. Looks just like his Misha, young, charming, unraveling hair, clean trench coat, but a teeny tiny bit more of solemn that tells him this is the angel Castiel, not his Misha.

Jensen widens his eyes, chokes on his voice. "Cass." he breathes.

Jack starts to explain the change in the universe, some effort he is going through to correct some wrongs, and that there are so many worlds that Chuck mistreated and angels messed around, it's near impossible to figure out what has going on in each of them and how to set it right. "People in those worlds, they're hurt too." Jack says, sincerely, "And these emotions, the pain and longing and love, they are all real. All the worlds are real, so I have to fix them."

Castiel steps towards Jensen. The weathered man looks at this face that is so much alike to the face he thinks and dreams every night but still so subtly different, he doesn't know if he wants to punch it or kiss it, so he just looks at him.

Castiel can't bear the amount of pain in his eyes. The angel looks away, shameful and regretful. "I'm sorry, Dea - Jensen. I really am."

Too little, too late. Jensen thinks. What is the use of apologies?

"He died because of you." Jensen says, his tone unavoidably accusing, "And you didn't even think to come back here to fix your mess! I prayed to you! Every god-damn day and night!"

Castiel drops his head and looks at the ground before looking back at his face, "I was arrogant, and stupid. I made too many mistakes. I'm sorry."

Jensen snorts.

"Let me make it right." Castiel offers.

"How?" Jensen demands.

He didn't miss the exchanged look between the angel and new God, Jack nods with a smile, and Castiel snaps his fingers.

"Jensen?" Misha calls his name, sound confusing.

For the second time of the day, Jensen turns around too quickly he almost tripped on his own foot.

And there he is, the beautiful man of his dream, standing right there in front of his own grave, wearing that stupidly cute blue flowery sweater, looking straight at him. Head tilted, mouth slightly open, eyes focused. Exactly like the way he is in Jensen's nights after nights of teary dreams, exactly like the way he used to be.

Jensen freezes completely. He feels like his brain has just been struck by a lightening and now all white and bright and electrical and dizzy and drunk.

He can't think. His body shuts down.

There is only one sentence in his brain playing loud and repeats itself: "He's back. He's back. He's back..."

Jensen throws himself towards him, wrapping his arms around Misha, holding him like nothing else in the world matters - because there is nothing. He's holding him so tight that both of them start to feel it difficult to breathe but none of them complains.

Misha wraps his arms around Jensen just like the way he did, caressing up and down his back, as if calming an anxious big animal. "Shhh," he says, "hey, I'm back."

Tears flood out from Jensen's eyes. He sobs loudly on Misha's shoulder, refuses to let him go even if they are already hugging for way too long - but in his mind there is no such thing as "too long". "You're back." He mumbles, too damn happy to know what else to say.

"How long have I been gone?" Misha asks gently. His eyes fall on Jensen's grey hair. His heart clenches.

"Too damn long." Jensen answers grumpily automatically.

Misha just holds him tighter, if it's even possible.

"We'll, just," Castiel hesitates, exchanging another look with his son, "leave you two then."

"Wait," Jensen bursts out, voice croaked, finally manages to set the embrace loose, but still holds one hand of Misha in his own, looking into Castiel's eyes. He says, in real earnest, "Thank you."

Castiel smiles, that tiny small hint of happiness blossoms from the tip of his lip, bright as if the spring just starts spreading out from there. Jensen somehow gets amused, as if he finally realizes how charming Castiel is, even if Misha plays as him every time on screen and they're supposed to be exactly the same. And the next second, Jensen realizes with astonishment that, this is the first time in ten years that he actually feels the sense of amusement, or anything that is not pain. The realization almost causes another breaching of dyke of tears.

The angel and the God flies away. They didn't say whether they'll come back or whatever their plan is for this universe. But frankly, Jensen doesn't really care. Dean's job might be to save his world, but Jensen only has one job: keeps the man that is currently holding his hand safe and happy. And maybe, in this miracle-free fairy-tale-free world, there might still be some miracle or fairy tale happening.
