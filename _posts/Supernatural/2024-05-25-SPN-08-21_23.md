>
> Naomi: Kids. So cute when they're little. Then they turn into teenagers, and the party's over. We haven't been formally introduced, Dean. My name is Naomi. [She sticks her hand out to shake Dean's hand, but he backs away from her.]
>
> Dean: Oh, I know who you are. And I know what you did to Cass after he got out of Purgatory.
>
> Naomi: After I rescued him from Purgatory, you mean, at the cost of many angels' lives.
>
> Dean: <u>You screwed with his head and had him spy on us.</u>
>
> Naomi: Well, it is true that I have spoken with Castiel many times, trying to reach out to him, trying to help him. Dean, you must have noticed how Purgatory changed him. I mean, he's been unstable in the past, but I was shocked at how damaged he is now.
>
> Dean: Stop, okay? Don't – don't try to spin this. <u>You think I don't know that you told him to try and kill me?</u>
>
> Naomi: Hmm. Yeah, I suppose that is how he would hear it. When I learned of the Angel tablet, I did tell Castiel to get it at any cost. That's my job – to protect heaven. I'm a warrior, just as you are. What would you expect? And now Castiel is in the wind with a hydrogen bomb in his pocket, and I – I'm scared, for all of us.
>
> Dean: Save it. See, I don't trust Angels, which means I don't trust you.
>
> Naomi: <u>And yet you haven't warded this place against us. I know. You're hoping Castiel will return to you. I admire your loyalty.</u> I only wish he felt the same way. I know you don't want to believe it, Dean, but we're on the same side – shutting the Gates of Hell, bringing Castiel in from the cold. Take a moment. Think about what I've said. Oh. I know you've been doing business with Ajay. He did mention, didn't he, that his way into Hell is through Purgatory? I knew you'd want to know. You see, we can be of help to each other. [She leaves, we hear wings flapping away.]

> Castiel: We were supposed to be their shepherds, not their murderers.
>
> Naomi: Not always, angel. <u>There was that day, back in Egypt, not so long ago, where we slew every first-born infant whose door wasn't splashed with lamb's blood. And that was just PR.</u>
>
> Castiel: Well, I wasn't there.
>
> Naomi: Oh, you were there. You just don't remember it.
>
> Castiel: How— how many times have you torn into my head and washed it clean?
>
> Naomi: Frankly? Too damn many.

> Naomi: <u>You're the famous spanner in the works. Honestly, I think you came off the line with a crack in your chassis. You have never done what you were told. Not completely. You don't even die right, do you?</u> Where is the angel tablet, Castiel?
>
> Castiel: In the words of a— good friend... <u>bite me.</u>

> Sa,: They can't do anything for me. You know, I've been remembering things, little things, so clearly—
>
> Dean: What, donkey rides?
>
> Sa,: You used to read to me, um, when I was little, I— I mean, really little, from that— from that old, uh... Classics Illustrated comic book. You remember that?
>
> Dean: No.
>
> Sa,: Knights of the Round Table. Had all of King Arthur's knights, and they were all on the quest for the Holy Grail. And I remember looking at this picture of Sir Galahad, and, and, and he was kneeling, and— and light streaming over his face, and— I remember... thinking, uh, I could never go on a quest like that. Because I'm not clean. I mean, I w— I was just a little kid. You think... maybe I knew? I mean, deep down, that— I had... demon blood in me, and about the evil of it, and that I'm— wasn't pure?
>
> Dean: Sam, it's not your fault.
>
> Sa,: It doesn't matter anymore. Because these trials... <u>they're purifying me.</u>

> Dean: All right. Let's roll.

> Castiel stands up.
>
> Dean: <u>[point at Castiel] Not you.</u>
>
> Castiel: Sam is more damaged than I am.
>
> Dean: Yeah, well, you know, even banged up, Sammy comes through.
>
> Castiel: Dean, I just want to help.
>
> Dean: <u>We don't need your help. Just stay here and – and get better.</u>

> Metatron: Is that what she told you? I mean, Naomi's a player – don't get me wrong – just one of many. There are factions upon factions, all fighting, betraying each other. It's just a matter of time before they start ripping each other apart. It's all broken.

> Castiel: I *am* the one that caused these problems. I should be the one to fix them.
>
> Metatron: But you understand this is, um, not going to be easy.
>
> Castiel: I understand.
>
> Metatron: No, you don't. See our waitress? She's the first trial – got to cut her heart out.
>
> Castiel: What? No, she's... She's just a girl.
>
> Metatron: No, she isn't. She's a Nephilim, an abomination.
>
> Castiel: She's the offspring of an angel and a human? I thought that wasn't allowed.
>
> Metatron: It's not. There's only one on Earth, and you are looking at it.
>
> Castiel: But she didn't choose to be a Nephilim, so she's innocent.
>
> Metatron: Yes, she is. I told you it wasn't gonna be easy. But if you want to do this, Castiel, if you *really* want to do this, you got to ask yourself what's more important – her life or your family?

> Crowley: I thought of sending in a few of my bruisers, really letting them go to town. But then, well, trial one was kill a Hellhound. Trial two was rescue a soul from the pit. So, from here on, I'm gonna keep everything hell-related – demons, et cetera – away from you. Safe side and all that – plus, I just thought it seemed fitting. From what I understand, Sammy took that bird's breath away. What's the line? "Saving people, hunting things – the family business." Well, I think the people you save, they're how you justify your pathetic little lives. The alcoholism, the collateral damage, the pain you've caused – the one thing that allows you to sleep at night, the one thing is knowing that these folks are out there, still out there happy and healthy because of you, you great, big, bloody heroes!

<br>

> Crowley: You want to keep those people alive. I want complete and utter surrender. The tablet, the trials – you'll give them up, or we'll keep doing this dance. <u>Your choice, my darlings.</u>

> Castiel: Do you really think it's wise to be drinking on the job?
>
> Dean: What show you been watching? Talk to me. Are you sure about this? I mean, it's one thing me and Sammy slamming the gates to the pit, but you -- you're -- you're boarding up Heaven, and you're locking the door behind you.
>
> Castiel: Yeah. I know.
>
> Dean: You did a lot of damage up there, man. You think they're just gonna let that slide?
>
> Castiel: <u>Do you mean do I think they'll kill me? Yeah, they might.</u>
>
> Dean: So this is it? E.T. goes home.
>
> [Dean looks at Castiel and smiles but realizes Castiel doesn't get the joke so he rolls his eyes as he hears someone enter a door at the other end of the bar.]

> Crowley: Aah! Aah! "Band of Brothers"? "The Pacific"? None of this means anything to you? All those motels, you never once watched HBO, not once? "Girls"? You're my Marnie, Moose. A-and Hannah -- she just --she needs to be loved. She deserves it. <u>Don't we all -- you, me -- we deserve to be loved. I deserve to be loved! I just want to be loved.</u>

> Crowley: Would it be possible, Moose...I'd like...to ask you a-a favor, Sam. Earlier, when you were confessing back there...what did you say? I only ask because, given my history...it raises the question... <u>Where do I start...to even look for forgiveness?</u> I mean...

> [As Metatron speaks to Castiel he slams his head back on the head rest of the chair. Metatron pulls out an angel blade and holds it to Castiel's neck. Metatron then cuts into Castiel's neck and Castiel's glowing grace seeps out through the cut.]
>
> Metatron: These were never trials, Castiel. This is a spell. And what I'm taking from you now -- your essence, your Grace -- is the last piece.
>
> [Metatron holds a small vial to Castiel's neck and Castiel's grace spells into the vial. Metatron then places a hand over Castiel's cut and the cut disappears as he slides his hand across it.]

> Metatron: And now something wonderful is going to happen, for me and for you. I want you to live this new life to the fullest. Find a wife. Make babies. And when you die and your soul comes to Heaven, find me. Tell me your story.

> Sam: Look at him. Look at him! Look how close we are! Other people will die if I don't finish this!
>
> Dean: Think about it. <u>Think about what we know, huh? Pulling souls from hell, curing demons, hell, ganking a Hellhound! We have enough knowledge on our side to turn the tide here.</u> But I can't do it without you.
>
> Sam: You can barely do it with me. I mean, you think I screw up everything I try. <u>You think I need a chaperone, remember?</u>
>
> Dean: Come on, man. That's not what I meant.
>
> Sam: No, it's exactly what you meant. You want to know what I confessed in there? <u>What my greatest sin was? It was how many times I let you down. I can't do that again.</u>
>
> Dean: Sam --
>
> Sam: [beginning to cry] <u>What happens when you've decided I can't be trusted again? I mean, who are you gonna turn to next time instead of me? Another angel, another -- another vampire? Do you have any idea what it feels like to watch your brother just –</u>
>
> Dean: Hold on, hold on! You seriously think that? Because none of it -- none of it -- is true. Listen, man, I know we've had our disagreements, okay? Hell, I know I've said some junk that set you back on your heels. But, Sammy...come on. <u>I killed Benny to save you. I'm willing to let this bastard and all the sons of bitches that killed mom walk because of you. Don't you dare think that there is anything, past or present, that I would put in front of you!</u> It has never been like that, ever! I need you to see that. I'm begging you.
>
> Sam: How do I stop?
