The dimension in between is -- for lack of a better word -- confusing. It's kaleidoscopical, it's a meat grinder of light and darkness and everything in between, a blender of color and shape, a garbage disposal of mind and body.

Starting with the darkness, then the lights from other dimensions start flashing in, like stars from other side of the curtain, then brighter than sunshine.

It takes I-don't-know-how-long to find the words and thoughts again, find the pieces that belonged to me and put them together. It takes longer to see the lights, see them growing and glowing, and even longer to realize what they are.

Prayers can't reach this dimension, yearnings do. The stronger the emotion, the brighter the lights. It starts with brightness of comets, on and off, flickering, blinking, flying by; then that of Mercury and Venus, as they're seen from Earth; soon as anchoring and pointy as Polaris in Ursa Minor, as bright and consistent as Orion and Perseus; then, it is supernova explosion.

There is a similarity between here and the deep space in the more familiar dimension.

It feels familiar. It feels home.

It takes a while, but the realization finally dawns: Why are the lights so bright, so calling, so intense that I want nothing but staring into it, going after it, merging into it -- because it is beacon, sent by the one human being that anchors my existence, shines the way back. It is Dean, calling for me.

<br>

The separation that divides the dimensions, is near impossible to tear. It is no cotton fabric of a curtain, it is as steely as a diamond wall hundreds of thousands of miles thick, if its thickness is not infinity.

There is no way through -- none that I can manage by myself.

But I'm not doing it by myself.

I can't hear him, can't really see clear enough of his whereabouts, but the light of emotion radiated from him, directly coming from the beating heart, that is all I ever needed.

When the light bursts so bright and desperate, it shines red and bloody, like the bleeding hole on the chest of a thorn bird, the sonorous melody when it sings its last song while the thorn piercing through its heart. The power and intensity so strong and insistent, it can cut through everything just to reach its aim -- me.

It cuts the divides thin, I push it through. There he is, Dean. But dying. Almost always, dying. Even more so, when I'm around.

More so, when the tear is open, and dangers seep through.

I watch myself, stepping over the tear. Hands, feet, cloths; wings, rings, eyes. The vessel, the angel, the monster, the bad luck. Nowadays, it seems, I'm always the combination of all of these. The eye of the disaster storm, the reason why Dean is in danger.

"I'm here now." I want to say. The sound comes out harsh and sharp, too loud for human. Dean's hands cover his ears. I'm hurting him again. It seems, I'm always hurting him, one way or another.

I mute my own sound, ignoring the chanting deep within, repeating Dean's name. Ache. It doesn't matter. I don't matter. It should be about Dean. It's always all about Dean.

"Stay." I hear him say. Half hear from words, half through prayer, reaching deep into my core.

"I need you." I hear him think. Don't need to invade his mind, the thoughts are already loud enough.

"What do you need me for, Dean?" I wonder. I heal him. I help him on his feet. I wipe his tears.

I put my wings around him, leaning into the warmth of the human body. Greedily. Selfishly.

Taking in his whole existence, grasping the memory, getting prepared.

"I miss you too." I'm thinking. Never told him, probably never going to.

"I'm sorry." I see blood. Then I see tears.

I see danger. And I see pain. The bright light in his soul, never more blinding.

Why is the word "tear" both the sad salty sea water, and the broken wound that never really heals? Because they're, really, the very same thing.

I see the way out, and I see the way to keep Dean safe. The crossroads.

Think carefully, choose wisely.

It is never a decision that needs ponder.

Stepping aside, stepping back.

Wound of the dimension, fixed by body of broken -- sounds poetically fair. And perfect for a penance.

I'm back where I were. The tearing, confusing place. The dimension in between.

I still hear the yelling of his calling.

And beats of his heart.
