Dean opens his eyes again. He is still alone on the cold roadside of Alaska, at the World's End, with no more road to go and a large clump of lifeless figure collapsed in front of him on the ground. But for once, he feels good. For once, he is not really alone -- maybe he never was.

The sensation of Cas's presence tugs gently in his mind. Dean tucks him in, feeling oddly like hens tucking chickens beneath their wings. All the while the angel's body remains an enormous hill in front of him. Dean laughs at the humor of the scene. He hears Cas mumbles a small note of unhappiness at the back of his head.

Dean has to restrain his smile a little. "Sorry buddy, no, not laughing at the body, I swear." He reassures the angel. "Just thinking how extremely like a black satire movie this is. Would make a masterpiece as art, instead of, you know, as life."

Cas chuckles softly.

Dean is getting better used to the overly brightened view now. He widens his eyes in curiosity. The view of the world is so abundant with light and color, casting clarity that he has never known. And he realizes the glinting stars constantly shining in his vision aren't really stars, that's air, for what air really is. The air is not transparent emptiness, instead, the tiniest particles charged with electricity shooting through space, bumping and colliding, transferring power and energy. That must be where all the low buzzing and humming come from, and the faint electric prickle on the skin as if brushing against a low-voltage power line.

"The entire Earth's electromagnetic field is being affected by the tear this time," Cas explains from the backseat of his mind, deeply worried. "Because of the infinite plasma. The aurora borealis is only the first phenomenon. Soon, Earth will draw the Moon and itself off orbit, then disrupt solar activity so much to the point the whole solar system could collapse off balance, we don't have long."

Dean looks up at the sky. It looks nothing like what his human eyes witnessed before. Well, in a way, it might still be the same scene, the mixed dazzling colors, shapes that are like flowing curtains and snakes and flames sweeping across the sky. Except now, there are so much more details filling in the blanks.

Now he sees more than light, more than color, more than sky. He sees the world as it is, he sees plasma punching through the ionosphere, he sees electrons leaping in and out of excited atoms, he sees oxygens glowing red and nitrogen beaming green, there is even infrared and ultraviolet that he's sure beyond human eye perception. The particles dance in the sky, painting fascinating patterns like tails of dragons, wings of phoenixes, eyes of thunderbirds. The palette of the universe, so big and so small at the same time. A world that no human eyes were meant to witness, and now he is bathed in its beauty and magnificence. Because he has an angel inside him. He is not watching with eyes alone.

He doesn't realize tears are streaming down his face until he hears Cas's low soothing voice: "I'm sorry, Dean. Is it too much? I can restrain the vision, and the other sensations..."

There is also sound and scent and touch. He doesn't even have enough attention or time for those yet. All the new sensations for the world. It's almost like being reborn.

"No, no," Dean mutters, out of breath, wiping away his tears in a hurry. Tears that are not coming from sorrow, or grief, or worry, or joy, or any emotion really. It's the body reacting to the view, being taken by the grandiosity, overwhelmed by the shared sensation with an angel.

The magic of the moment is broken by the movement. He forces himself to tear his eyes away from the sky, feeling that sinking ache of knowing he may never see anything like this again in his life, not after Cas leaves him. He wants to remember this, but he has work to do. Is this what Cas meant when he said he could only taste molecules when he tried food? Because to an angel's eyes and senses, the whole world is too generously and selfishly only showing its fundamentals all the time, only particles. The view, the sound, the taste, the scent, the touch. Everything as it fundamentally is, stripped down to its smallest components. The smallest, and sometimes the largest. Knowing too much, and sometimes feeling too little.

And he hears Cas answering, quietly, a little sad. "Yes. Sometimes."

Though Dean didn't really ask the question. He doesn't have to.

<br>

He sees the world as it is.

Then he sees Cas as he is.

And he sees himself as he is.

Dean's eyes land on Cas's body next. The giant form dressed in a skyscraper-sized trench coat and clothes that is most human yet furthest from human. The body looks slimmer without the wings, but it's still a mountainous presence.

*The vessel is made of atoms and electrons in the material plane.* Dean remembers Cas's words again, the theory Cas once tried to explain to him but he had to cut him off because he couldn't understand. And this time, now, he doesn't just understand, he sees it now.

The hand of the vessel lies limp at its side, stretched loosely on the middle of the road, fingers curved, as tall as houses. Dean walks toward them. It takes a few minutes.

Everything is in so much details. Every grain of skin, every line of the palm, every hair and scar, every dip and wrinkle. He sees the hand, then he sees flesh and blood and bone beneath the skin, at last he sees the atoms and molecules forming every cell, vibrating and humming with energy as all particles do.

Dean presses his own palm against the edge of this giant hand of Cas's body, it feels like touching a wall of flesh, bizarre and unsettling. But they touch. And he finds them the same. The same particles that form everything in this universe, in all the bodies, in Dean's body and Cas's vessel, in flesh and blood, in planets and dust. Things that are as old as stars, and as young as newborns. In the material plane, they are the same. But Castiel is not.

Cas is not physical, not really. Cas does not come from this dimension, but he chooses to be here, he comes here. He resides in a body, and he walks the Earth. And now, he is inside Dean. He drops the grand form, and he curls his entire multidimensional wavelength into that small corner of Dean's mind. And he doesn't complain about claustrophobia. He stands there, and he says, "Dean." As if all that he wants to say can be condensed into one word. As if this place, of all, is the only place he'd rather be.

For the first time, Dean thinks, maybe this is for the first time, he finally starts to have a glimpse of understanding what it means to be an angel. A real angel, in all their forms, from their perspective. Not just the vessel, not just a thread of light, not just a part of the whole. Not just, a fragment of trench coat, a scrap of tie fabric, a flying feather, a floating eye, or a silvery slice of ring -- the pieces he saw in the in-between dimension, the pieces giving him nightmares nights after nights. Oddly, Dean finds himself feeling a tiny bit of appreciation for what that place showed him. As many nightmares as it gave him, he finally gets to understand, Cas is magnificent and giant and beautiful, beyond his imagination. For the first time, for real.

Dean clenches his fingers, putting his weight on the hands, holding himself there. At that moment, he wants nothing more than to really hold that hand, to hold Cas. So he turns back to inside his head.

Cas meets him in the mental manifestation of Bobby's place. The sunlight seeping through the window doesn't shift, time doesn't move here. Still the same nice lazy afternoon. The bright sunlight shines on half of Cas's figure, dyeing his black hair a golden brown.

And Dean reaches for his hands, squeezing them, looking him in the eyes. Those big blue, ocean-deep, glacier-old, universe-witnessing, dimension-traveling eyes. And Dean whispers, "God, you really are an Angel."

It has been almost five years since Cas charged into that barn and declared, "I'm an Angel of the Lord."

Dean stutters, thinking back on all that he saw, not just tonight, not just the past months after Purgatory. "Everything... is, is beautiful, and awesome, and... Jesus, I wish I knew more words."

Cas smiles at him, a gentle and small smile. He nods slightly. His eyes shine.

He understands.

Dean swallows hard, "Never, ever, say you don't deserve."

And that smile drops.
