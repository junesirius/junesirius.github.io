## Draft

### Art prompt

> Castiel leaves purgatory through the portal with Dean, but since Cas is in a vessel without a soul the human portal has unexpected consequences and Castiel is stuck in a spliced form of his true form and human vessel. Cas is stuck between dimensions and keeps fighting to get back to the same plane as Dean, and the process of reappearing creates omens that Dean can trace to find him when he does briefly appear in his giant form.

### Outline (1st draft)

time: October 2012

Dean comes back from purgatory, witnesses Cas get torn apart the moment he pass through the portal and disappears, doesn't know if Cas is killed in the process, determined to find Cas if he's not (self-comfort: maybe he's just pulled away, like angel-banishing spell). Dean goes to find Sam, Sam is living with Amelia happily, Dean decides not pull him out of apple pie life again, goes to hunt/search on his own, actively looks for monster/Leviathan/angel sign

Dean finds case of yeti in snow mountain (Rocky Mountain, Colorado), rumor says bigfoot trace but not bare foot, dress shoe trace, witness says seeing trench coat fabric but must be hallucination, Dean raises hope, starts searching, finds tear of dimension and bloody coat fabric in it (too big), believes Cas is out there (keep feeling being watched). finds actual Yeti escaped from purgatory, Yeti-Troll fights, Dean gets in between and almost gets killed, saved by angelic light but can't see Cas; the grace light weave into tear, sends monsters back and fix the hole, Cas gets pulled away as it closes [+Cas POV: dark, confused, chaotic, stumble foot print in snow, pulled away before manifest]

Dean follows giant monster witness report, rumor says Archaeopteryx (ancient first bird fossil) in place with huge tall trees (Redwood, California). Dean drives there, gets spooked, feels being watched but no one around, thinks he sees shape of giant Cas's wings in night black but disappear in a blink (only get a glimpse), thinks he's going crazy, finds another tear of dimension and bloody feather in it (too big). almost gets killed by Greek creature Harpy (half-human half-bird, eat human, decapitation) and gets saved by Cas, protected by six huge black wings (Cas wants to talk but only in true voice and too loud, breaks glasses, but Dean is sure by now it's Cas), Cas gets pulled away again as the tear closes [+Cas POV: can't talk, can't stay, self-aware weird shape, watch Dean from the other side, see him hurt and fight to force through to save, weakened by each attempt]

Dean goes to Missouri, Pamela's seance had witnessed Cas's true form in multidimension then so can Missouri (use feather/coat fabric as medium), Dean gets info hint that Cas's true form and vessel are spliced and he's stuck, swears to find&help him. [+Cas POV: meet with Missouri in seance/spirit dimension, can talk/see, hesitant to come back because not want to continue tear dimension to endanger reality&Dean]

Dean drives around, keeps getting spooky feeling of continuously being watched, hears local legend of Cthulhu (humanoid, huge, tentacle, hundreds of meters tall) in Alaska, sees weird/astonishing aurora lights on sky, drives there. midnight, empty road, tear opens, sees giant Cas manifest in full size right in front of impala, wings+rings with eyes+trench coat, leviathans also come through the tear. Dean shocked/terrified/in awe then busy fighting, giant Cas kills them (easier than normal size but easily tired). Dean&Cas grab a few moments to talk/sync (the physics theory behind), Cas worries his reaction at first, Dean needs time to adjust, sees him for real now, not react/communicate well. Cas sensitive, feel rejected/upset, afraid Dean disgust/fear his true form now, self-aware being monster. Cas gets weaker quickly for staying in this dimension talking for long, fighting against natural order, and with the tear more leviathans coming through. For Dean's safety and Cas's own exhaustion, Cas gets pulled back and tear closes. [both POV, Cas upset, self-aware]

Dean's idea (convey through pray): expel him (S04E10/16 Alastair's spell; separate true form with body) and immediately summon him back (S06E21 angel summoning spell; avoid true form going into heaven), let Cas possess him as vessel temporarily, use his own power fix his vessel's size, jump back into his body. talk through Ouija Board, Cas hesitates for risk of hurting Dean (possession+tear open with monsters coming) and he won't be there protecting him, doesn't mention also afraid of getting expelled and not summoned in time make him end up in Heaven, "might kill himself"

Dean insists trying, ritual works, Cas shares Dean's body but both awake, Cas use mojo to fix vessel (Dean witnesses, amazed, "so this is how it's like, internally" "that sounds so wrong but whatever") and ready to go back into it (Cas all the time quiet), Dean mentally apologize and tell him his true form is awesome before Cas goes back (talk in Dean's brain, both normal: "You really think that?" "Yeah, I do"). Cas leaves Dean's body, vessel remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, problem solved, "Welcome back."

### Cas's pieces

- trench coat/tie clothing fabric
- wing/feather
- ring/eyes
- light/grace

### Monster inspire/reference

case fic? actually all Cas

- yeti/big foot: only see footprint (~3m)
- Godzilla: biggest ~300m
- Cthulhu: humanoid, tentacles, otherworldly god, hundreds of meters
- Mega-Kaiju: (Pacific Rim) biggest ~100m
- alien, transformer, predator, king kong

real case fic source of monster:

(stick with basics and reuse S8 everyday monsters)

- vampire
- werewolf
- djinn
- ghost
- ~~leviathan~~
- ~~demon~~

### Theory/physics

Tear of dimension: leave power/energy surge/draining, break wall between spaces, free traveling around between dimensions (≈purgatory exit)

Cas's true form: multidimensional wavelength celestial being, size of Chrysler Building (319m, ~1k feet)

Why giant: true form wavelength gets twisted at the edge of dimension, think of as how light get refracted on different media interface e.g. water-air surface; or quantum physics, wave-particle duality, wave longer after passing through smaller slit, diffraction effect

Dean: "Cas, English" Cas: "going through portal makes me giant"

Dean: "Who's dragging you away?" Cas: "Law of physics"

Dean: "Are you saying you're here, but the other part of you is still in some wormhole space?"

Cas: "In a manner of speaking, yes"

Dean: "How can I get you back, the whole complete you, not pieces of glimpses here and there" Cas: "I don't know" don't know if it's even possible, or if he really wants given the risks on Dean

Solution: needs to separate true form from vessel, expel him then bound him again, banishing+summoning spell+holy fire circle

(above is conversation during seance by Missouri)

### Reference

ominous spooky feeling: ≈P3 Sirius Black bad omen black dog (fearful but fundamentally good-natured, mysterious, suspension)

high dimension: Interstellar (2014, not released yet; current=2012, time swap)

something big and huge and enormous: The Drowned Giant (Love, Death, Robot S2)

### Easter Eggs

Chap. 2, the legends of the giant fish and bird: quote from 庄周《逍遥游》“北冥有鱼，其名为鲲。鲲之大，不知其几千里也；化而为鸟，其名为鹏。鹏之背，不知其几千里也，怒而飞，其翼若垂天之云。”

Chap. 2, how does Dean know about the names of the trees, plants, creatures and birds: apparently Cas has dragged him to watch Nature channel together more than once, and he actually paid attention. Especially the bird part, he doesn't even realize he has a thing for them until much later and also in here, he realizes he does memorized those things and names he watched, while thinking about Cas's wings. But still, even when they were watching together and when he was definitely thinking about Cas's wings, he never really asked, so he never know Cas's wings true color or there are three pairs of them. (could potentially add an epilogue of watching bird Nature channel together or go back to the Redwood again with Cas guiding and introducing the creatures/plants, and Dean's knowledge surprise Cas too)

Chap. 3 "something from the angel as the medium, the things he recognize as his, to guide him to the call", the medium is not trench coat or feather, it's Dean's body warmth on them, it's Dean. It's always Dean.

Chap. 4, "did he dream about purgatory when he's outside, or did he dream about outside when he's still in purgatory" is like 庄周梦蝶蝶梦庄周

Chap. 4-3 The joke Amelia says by Sam's ear is: "I hope you won't name our kid 'Kid'."

Chapter titles "In your eyes" "Inside my minds": "your" and "my" mean both of them

Chap. 6 the shrinking body, the lost mass becomes energy, that's the mass-energy equivalence

Chap. 6 the infinite past and future possibilities: inspired by DW the long song episode

Chap. 6 the memory and apologies and forgiveness and kisses, they are parallel and necessary to the process of fixing the body, because, the dimension in between doesn't only shred and mess up Cas's body and forms, not just the merging of wings and vessel, but also inside the head. Like Dean realized before, the angelic memories and the screwed-up psychological knots and very human emotions, those need healing too. So they go through that fixing process in parallel, though even both of them don't quite realize.

### Dean's mental state

≈S08E01-07

mission mode, focus on the saving mission

focus on guilty, heavy self-blame, feel crap for not getting Cas back complete

he can only save Cas if he lets go of some of that blame/guilt

### Cas's mental state

≈S08E07-10

focus on self-punishment, torn between dimension and true form & vessel=torn between saving heaven vs earth, choosing angel vs human, go back to purgatory for self-punishment/penance vs go back to earth to help/protect Dean

so every time Cas fights hard to tear through dimension to get to this plane, to protect Dean, he gets more wounded and weaker in celestial part, so the fighting back itself is a step closer to the final decision point and away from torn state, so finally he can get out of the intertwined quantum superposition state, he comes back to Dean once he figure out he can only protect Dean if he forgives himself (more or less), his choice is always Dean more than anything else

**main curve**: Cas needs to really decide on the answer to "What are you, angel or human" (if angel, true form; if human, body) -> but he *is* both

### Edit Notes

~~(general, especially Chap. 1) memory from Purgatory use past tense, the rest use present tense~~

~~(Chap. 1-4, 2-4) Cas's POV, 1st person view to 3rd person view? but maintain Cas's POV~~

wings flutter -> rustle

~~anchoring -> grounding~~

wince/grimace -> cringe

atoms and electrons -> atoms and molecules

~~loud: the sound of mountains moving, oceans turning, volcanos exploding~~

~~several inch/feet away -> yards away~~

hospital gown -> white hospital shirt and pants

~~canopy of twinkling stars~~

dislocated

croak, rasp

magnificent

(general) change all the bad analogies to the proper ones with references Dean would use, e.g. remove all Disney movies & fairy tales & princesses & Anderson's Little Match Girl, replace with old classic movies & rock bands & western movies

~~(Chap. 3) Dean has no body but only eyes, "like the one painted on Missouri's round table"~~

(during posting, on AO3) posting Chap 1 Act 1,2,3 as Chap 1 Part One, Act 4 as Chap 1 Part Two (second AO3 chapter but same my chapter title); same for Chap 2; Chap 3's Appendix put at the very end after last chap (put a "Not a Chapter" by the chapter title), then Chap 3's after-work notes link to appendix (once published and have link); "Supplements" ("Not a Chapter") add the Amelia-Sam joke about "Kid" from Chap 4-3

(Chap. 1-5) add more flashback, broken!Cas & god!Cas & Leviathan year & Purgatory time, emphasize more on the damage they've done, and the mental states those past caused them

(all Chaps) examine first/third person view in *thoughts* with/without POVs

~~(Chap. 5/6) balance chap. 5/6 length, can move Chap.6-1/2 to Chap.5-2/3, depend on how long Chap.6 end up with once finished~~

### Summary

Cas had mentioned too damn many times they had no idea if the portal would allow an angel to pass, but they'd agreed to try, together. And they did. Their hands held tight, no one let go. But just like every other long shot in their bloody lives -- the bleak hopes, the only plans -- it didn't work. They never do.

It's a human portal, after all. It only works on pure humans, so it should be no surprise that it would try to parse out any human part to throw out Purgatory, leaving the rest behind. When an angel in a vessel has both, it means tearing him apart. Literally.

## Main

### Chap. 1 On the Mountaintop (Back+Snow storm)

> **Outline:** Dean comes back from purgatory, witnesses Cas get torn apart the moment he pass through the portal and disappears, doesn't know if Cas is killed in the process, determined to find Cas if he's not (self-comfort: maybe he's just pulled away, like angel-banishing spell). Dean goes to find Sam, Sam is living with Amelia happily (Kermit, Texas), Dean decides not pull him out of apple pie life again, goes to hunt/search on his own, actively looks for monster/Leviathan/angel sign
>
> Dean finds case of yeti in snow mountain (Rocky Mountain, Colorado), rumor says bigfoot trace but not bare foot, dress shoe trace, witness says seeing trench coat fabric but must be hallucination, Dean raises hope, starts searching, finds tear of dimension and bloody coat fabric in it (too big), believes Cas is out there (keep feeling being watched). Dean gets caught in a fierce snow storm and almost freezes to death, saved by angelic light, gets a glimpse of Cas, see big trench coat shape but can't see him as a whole; the grace light weave into tear, fixes the tear, Cas gets pulled away as it closes, leaves a piece of cloth behind
>
> [+Cas POV: dark, confused, chaotic, torn apart, pieces, stumble foot print in snow, pulled away before manifest; no complete sentence]

#### Act 1

Dean slams on the gas hard. The stolen car roars in exhaustion, kicking up dirt along the way. He rolls the window down, not caring about the dust flowing in and out. Not like it could make his face any dirtier than it already is. Not like any place on Earth can get any dirtier than the place he just came back from.

The night road stretches ahead, wide on both sides. Empty. No sight of another human being, not a single passing car. Frogs croak loudly in the fields along the road.

Dean just stares at the road, and drives. Like it's the only thing he can think of. It's the only thing he can still trust himself to do, without breaking anything, or losing anything, again.

He drives on the freeway from the hundred-mile wilderness in Maine, to west, to south, to anywhere the road leads him to. He drives, so he doesn't need to think, or talk, or eat, or sleep. As if, if the road can continue stretching and the driving can last long, then all the things he left behind, all the things he just lost, might never catch up.

<br>

They still catch up. Of course they do. The images and sounds and smells of that filthy place. The memories of everything that happened in the past year. They catch up to him, close in around him, like a snake coiling its prey before swallowing it whole while it's still alive. Dean is the prey, the meal of a serpent conjured by his own brain, made from that bitter, bloody thing called "memory".

"Dean --" He remembers Cas calling his name. Desperate. His eyes on him. His hands in his. His whole life and trust and everything he carried, all put in the hands they held together. Dean saw it all in Cas's eyes, heard it all in his voice. Dean grasped him tight, and didn't let go.

Their palms were slick with blood and sweat. Every inch of his muscle in Dean's arms and back screamed in stretched strain, the stress sharpened into pain quickly, but he didn't let go. He didn't. Cas's full weight leaned on him, depended on him. So Dean held him tight, just as desperate, as if the whole world rested in the hand he held, because it might as well was.

And then, it stopped. The weight disappeared. The hands loosened. They stepped over the portal together, Dean remembered agonizingly clearly, he fell onto the solid ground of sweet Earth, and two feet besides him where Cas should be, there was only a blast of bright light, and then, there was nothing.

He heard Cas scream, whether it's his human voice pitched too high or his angel voice shrieking, he couldn't tell. All he saw was the silver flare of Cas's grace exploding in front of him, torn apart at the moment of passing. His final cry broken, his last sound painful. He yelled for him one last time, then he was not there anymore. Nowhere to be found.

Cas had mentioned too damn many times they had no idea if the portal would allow an angel to pass, but they'd agreed to try, together. And they did. But just like every other long shot in their bloody lives -- the bleak hopes, the only plans -- it didn't work. They never do.

Dean yelled Cas's name, shouted until his throat hoarse. He would have torn reality a hole right then and there if he knew how, just to tear open the portal again, to see if Cas had fallen back into the Monsterland. He would've jumped back into the place to get Cas back, he swore, just like he had told him, the bottom line was, they were going home together, and he wouldn't leave if Cas is not here with him.

But promises are empty, swears fall into nothing. He is here, and Castiel is not.

Dean stares hard at the front of the windshield, gazing at the road so hard and rigid without blinking that it starts making his eyes watery. Cas should be here, by his side, riding shotgun. They should be going home, together.

Dean punches the wheel, swearing, cursing. The first hint of sunrise emerges at the end of the road, piercing right into his eyes. He blinks at the sudden light, the golden color looks nothing like Castiel's grace, but light is light. Dean blinks again, the dry eyes finally gather enough moisture at the corner that tears threaten to fall.

Dean wipes his eyes roughly with the back of his hand. The dampness mixes with the dirt and dried blood still caked on his skin, making a mess. He presses harder on the gas, urging the car forward, as if he's rushing toward a destination, as if he knows where to go, or where to find Cas.

"You are not dead, Cas." Dean growls at the empty road ahead. He's not gone, he *knows* that. Just blown away by the portal, or something like that. *I'll get you back.* Dean promises. *I found you in Purgatory, I'll find you again.*

The car rumbles forward in a loud engine moan, speeding down the road that is slowly lighting up under the newborn sun.

<br>

All of Sam's cellphones are offline. Dean tries every single one that he can remember, but pretty much always gets a robotic voice telling him empty service or empty number, barely even any having Sam's recorded message playing out, asking for a voicemail. He tries his own old cells too, no difference.

It takes three days to track Sam down again. Patterns and old habits die hard, traces scattered around like breadcrumbs. He rolls into the small town of Kermit, Texas, parking in front of a white-fenced house.

Thin white curtains with laces half cover the room. He glances inside.

Sam stands with a woman, holding her close. The two of them are kissing, gently. Most of the time, they are simply holding each other, his hands on her shoulders, hers around his waist, their foreheads pressed together, breathing each other's breath, like  people slow dancing to an old classic waltz.

Dean looks at this white-picket-fence apple-pie life they used to joke about, sometimes dream about, never once truly believed could be theirs.

He drives away. Leaving the house in his rearview.

They even have flowers with small purple blossoms in the garden, poking out between the fences, oblivious to the early winter chill of October.

Dean leaves town after midnight -- but not before he sneaks into the garage and drives away in his Impala. The Baby was covered under a neat canvas. The keys hung by the garage door.

*You get a home now, at least let me have mine.* Dean thinks as he settles into the familiar driver's seat, reversing onto the road, wondering for a minute how long it will even take before Sam notices the Impala isn't where it was. For a brief moment, he wonders if this is exactly how Cas felt, seeing him with Lisa right when he was knee-deep in trouble but not having the heart to knock on that freshly painted door.

You don't knock on a door like that, not with hands that can never wash clean of layered, dried bloodstains.

He leaves the town under a starry sky, the road empty and vast, like it always is these days.

<br>

#### Act 2

There is still work to do. There's always work, somewhere. Monsters, ghosts, something dark, something evil, something lurking in the night, waiting to tear people's hearts out or drink their blood dry.

Dean is good at finding things in the dark. But this time, he's looking for something in the light. Something bright and glaring, fluffy and feathery, something -- someone -- holy and angelic. *The angel.*

As much as he would say angels are nothing more than monsters with good PR, as many times as Cas has explained he doesn't have a harp, it seems that when he thinks of Cas, he still can't help but picture some shiny halos and wings in places he can't see. The same image he had in his mind at four years old, every night when his mom told him angels were watching over him. So that's what he looks for.

It starts turning into a routine. Dean gets into the habit of picking up a piece of newspaper at breakfast and reading through it over coffee. Then he sits in the cafe for the whole day, going through people's mention of angelic encounters online. He scans and scrolls, reads and looks, squints at the words of the witnesses and illustrations from so-called visionaries, thinking, if any of these can be a sign of Cas. If any of them can be luckier than he is, and has a glimpse of Cas while he cannot.

Then he drives, and reads, and asks around if there is anything strange and holy happening, anything like sudden increased heat, or bright light and thunderous sound. And he orders more papers. More coffee. Then he hits the road again.

The days and roads are muffled together. Dean distantly realizes he might be getting as bearded and dirty as he was in Purgatory, and he decides he doesn't care. He punches the word "angel" into the laptop search bar again.

<br>

There are some pagan gods in Wyoming, some werewolves in Michigan, and then some more pagan gods in Colorado. Dean takes care of them.

He had hoped maybe some of those pagan gods could have enough juice that he could negotiate to use. But at the end of the day, none of them are anything more than a bunch of bloodthirsty sons of bitches. Dean buries his knife in their chests or cuts their heads off, whatever works.

Blood from gods and creatures splatters across his face. Dean gets so used to it now he doesn't flinch or blink.

Some of these days, Earth feels no different from Purgatory. Full of ugly things, and none of the one he's looking for.

He still prays every night. And he drives on.

By November, he has cleaned out a nest of vampires in Washington and killed a nasty specter in Missouri. Winter is falling onto him fast. But the cold is the last thing he's worried about.

The first snow catches him when he's in Rocky Mountain, Colorado, trying to take a shortcut through the state, when a blizzard nearly buries half the car. He ends up staying in a tourist center on the waist of the mountain, stuck with a group of chatty tourists too dumb to travel without checking the weather report. He stares out the window at the roaring snow painting the whole world white and blank. Separated from the rest of the world.

There was no snow in Purgatory. Or rain. Or sun.

Everything was just gray and bleak, the trees half-dead with only trunks left standing, the ground covered in the dirt of corroded skeletons.

So at least, if nothing else, the snow is a good reminder this really is Earth. Dean watches the strong wind blow snowflakes as large as his palm against the glass, adding layers after layers. The view is soon blocked by the thick cover of snow and ice.

"No, I'm telling you, it's true, there are yetis in these mountains. Legends say they only come out in storms like this, feeding on lost hikers. The snow hides their tracks too well so they are super difficult to find, but we still managed to snap some photos." Some distant chatter reaches his ear. Dean focuses on the bitter coffee in his hands, trying to tune out any talk of new monsters or myths. He isn't really in a hunting mood right now.

Cold seeps in through the gaps of the windows.

He hears laughter from the crowd, whatever photo that guy is showing around, the rest of the group isn't buying it. A young woman's mocking voice is loud enough for him to hear from across the lobby:"This can't possibly be a Bigfoot print, Hector. What do you take us for, idiots? Look at the footprint, it's not even barefoot, might as well be a size-hundred dress shoe. Unless you're saying yetis start wearing suits and dress shoes now?" The crowd bursts into laughter.

Dean ducks his head and takes another sip of his coffee that's already gone cold. Cas used to wear dress shoes. It's been a long time since he saw him in the suit though, with everything so messed up and he ended up in a hospital gown that even got carried over into the other side of the portal. Dean finds himself missing that suit and that funny little backward tie.

He doesn't realize a tiny little curl has started pulling on the tip of his lips.

It's been too long. The last time they were both themselves, it feels like years and years ago. Decades even, so it feels. Before Purgatory, before broken Sam, before the Leviathans, or Raphael. A long, long time ago, when he could still straighten his ties, and tell Cas he's "also an FBI", only to watch the badge get displayed upside down.

God, how he wishes this were still then.

His lips drop entirely. He drinks another sip of  coffee. It's gone completely cold.

"If you don't believe the photo, I guess you won't believe what I saw with my own eyes, then," the man that must be Hector insists, voice rising over the lingering chuckles that haven't died down. "I swear to God, the day I took the photo, I saw a yeti way bigger than any on record. Must've been at least sixty feet tall, and the weirdest thing was its color. Not like the usual white yetis, this one was beige. And it stood so straight, if I didn't know any better, I might say it was a giant in a trench coat."

Dean jerks his head up so fast the movement even startles himself. He jumps to his feet, marches towards the group, and grabs the man by the collar before he registers what he's doing. "What did you say?" he growls right into the man's face.

Hector stutters. "Chill, man. Just some story time. I was telling the ladies about the other night on the mountain. Just so happened to see this weird-ass yeti."

"The trench coat, what did it look like?" Dean shakes his collar. The man is practically lifted to his toes like a cat caught by the scruff.

"Are you crazy? I don't know, just a trench coat! I mean, it's probably nothing, lights and reflections or something," Hector protests, pushing at Dean's shoulder.

Dean lets him go. "And you said he was on top of the mountain? In a snowstorm like this one?"

"*He*?" Hector snorts, flattening his wrinkled clothes. "Yeah, sure. On the highest top, standing next to a big fire pit with cooked human meat, dancing with other lady yetis!" The group of tourists erupts into louder laughter.

Dean turns around, walking straight toward the door.

"Sir, it's too dangerous to go outside in this weather!" One of the staff members calls after him.

Dean doesn't look back. "I'm going," he says.

<br>

#### Act 3

It's freezing cold outside. In fact, "freezing" is far too weak a term for this temperature. Any word that could describe this weather has already been blown away by the blizzard and frozen into the ground.

The snow has piled up and sealed the door shut. He has to climb out through one of the highest windows near the ceiling. The building is mostly buried under the unprecedented storm -- the fiercest and most sudden one that ever hit in all the recorded history, according to those people back inside.

Dean can feel every inch of his skin losing heat fast, he might only have minutes, or seconds, before his body is frozen into some ice sculpture. He may -- extremely likely -- be literally frozen to death, if he's not buried alive first.

But knowing what he knows now, there is no way he's just going to sit inside and do nothing. He could fight through Purgatory from one end to the other, certainly he can survive some snowstorm in Colorado.

Dean steps into the blizzard, and starts walking toward the mountaintop, where the rumors point. The snowflakes are as sharp as angel blades, cutting him bloody, but there is no dripping blood. Even the sliced veins freeze shut the moment they're wounded. The pain is sharp in the first minute, but numbs quickly. He doesn't feel like walking in the icy water anymore, more like boiling water. The cold burns hot. He knows some temperature sensors in his body must have been failing. But he can't care about that right now.

He can't see anything, there is nothing other than a whole complete blinding whiteness in every direction, with all kinds of different shades of pale. He pushes one step after another, but can't tell the difference between each step. He wonders if he's really moving uphill, or just repeating the same motion in the same place.

The storm grows fiercer when the top is nearer. The trees thin out, the snow darkens in color. Dean widens his eyes as far as they'll go, scanning the sky, the ground, the woods, the mountain. Searching the whole world for a glimpse of a color that doesn't belong to the white. Looking for a footprint, or a hint of beige.

"This is suicide, Dean." The voice, so familiar it aches, cuts through the storm, sounding up somewhere close by.

"Cas?" Dean spins around, turning sharply toward the sound.

"Dangerous, reckless, and stupid. You could die here, buried alive, and I'd never find you or your corpse again, you ever think about that?" Cas's voice, scolding. Sad.

"What?" Dean stills. Thinking, then tries, "You're not real, are you? I'm hallucinating."

"Hypothermia can lead to highly vivid and realistic hallucinations. It's been scientifically tested and confirmed." "Cas" steps out of the storm, standing in front of him. In his clean trench coat and straight suit, the blue tie tilted and backwards at the front. Hair unbelievably disheveled yet unmoving in the wind. Eyes as blue as the deepest sea and the clearest autumn sky. The view of the Angel of the Lord as he remembers from the first time they met, the look he forever dreamed about among all the other looks that came after.

"Cas," Dean murmurs, reaching for him, fingers catching nothing but snowflakes. The snow doesn't feel cold anymore.

A sad smile curls his lips as he looks "Cas" in the eyes. "I've been looking for you, Cas. Promised I'd find you and bring you home. But looks like I can't even keep that promise, I'm sorry."

"Cas" has a smile just as sad as his. "You're dying, Dean," He tells him, something he already knew. And then, "I won't let that happen. I can't."

Dean can't really think straight right now, can't fully process the meaning of the words. The cold has made his brain as sluggish as his hands and feet, everything working slower by the second, just like the gradually fading sound of his own heartbeat.

That is when the view in front of his eyes changes entirely. Dean blinks slowly, struggling to understand what he's seeing.

It is as if the storm is split into two halves, like a curtain being drawn open on an opera stage. To his left and right, snow and wind rage on, but right in front of him, in the center, a figure as tall as the sky emerges, stepping toward him slowly. Each step slams into the ground, shaking the earth like the giant from the Jack and the Beanstalk story.

Dean wants to step back, to look up, to speak. There are so many things he wants to do, instinct screams at him to run or fight, but his body is too frozen to move. So he just stares, feeling the newly risen adrenaline pumping fast, forcing his heart to beat harder. His brain struggles to parse the sight before him. The reality looks surreal.

The figure wears a long trench coat that reaches his knees -- tail of the coat taller than the highest trees in their surroundings. Dean looks up, lifting his head as far as his frozen neck allows, but still can't see the figure's face, can barely make out the hem of the coat whipping in the storm. He gasps, his sound caught in his throat.

It is Cas. Undoubtedly, impossibly, it's Cas. But it is so unlike Cas, not in any form Dean has ever known. Not in any history or legend. But it is Cas, for sure. He just knows.

Dean would recognize him anywhere, in any form. Not just by the trench coat, but by the *presence*. The weight of his gaze falling on to him even if he can't see his eyes; the warmth of concern radiating from his body, practically melting the snow and ice around them. And most of all, who else would ever like this, always come to him at the moment of dying. Hell is the first time, Green Room the second, Dean has long lost count of how many more there were.

"Cas." This time, Dean really is smiling. Dirt and snow and the smear of blood streak his face, making every small movement ache, but he's smiling anyway, wide and stupid.

He steps forward, but Cas pulls back. A thunderous sound rolls from above, as if it comes straight from the sky, low and deafening, like the wrath of the Greek gods befalling on Mount Olympus.

But it's not the sound of rage, or warning. Dean can't understand the syllables, but if he knows Cas at all -- which he does -- then he knows: this is his own name. He would know his own name in every single tongue Cas has ever spoken, and the tone would remain the same.

Dean takes another step forward, carefully, but Cas's figure takes another step back. One step, and he's a hundred feet farther. The blizzard around them roars to life once more, returning to its full intensity and fury. But closely around Dean, a small pocket remains calm and warm, protected from the storm, like a shimmering bubble in space, glowing gold and silver, the color of Cas's grace.

"What's wrong?" Dean manages, his voice swallowed by the wind the moment it leaves his mouth.

Cas makes another sound, just one word, not "Dean", certainly not "Hello".

"No, no, no, no! Cas!" Dean yells, desperate, instinctive. "Wait! Don't! Not 'Goodbye' again! Not so soon! Stay, please!"

Cas turns away, stepping aside. That is when he sees it. A tear in the space behind him, like a massive ugly wound of the reality standing vertical, gaping open like Sauron's evil eye glaring down at the earth. Gray and black smoke coils at the edge like windblown curtains, more ominous than when gates of Hell open. The blizzard pours straight out from the center of the rift, and God knows what else has come through that hole, or what is on the other side.

Cas must be holding it back with his body -- this enormous body he has now, however that happened.

"Cas..." Dean hates it he can't do anything, especially when he knows exactly what is about to happen next. It's the same nightmare that he's been having for ages, over and over, after the day the Cage opened, after Cas walked into the river. The same horror he feared every single night in Purgatory. And it seems, with Cas, it's just gonna keep replaying in reality.

Dean forces himself to run, willing his frozen legs and body into motion, trying to close the distance between them. He pushes as fast as he can. And Cas takes another step back, putting another hundred feet between them. Then another.

Cas is right in front of that huge tear in the dimension now. Bright light starts leaking from him, seeping into the opening, weaving across it like needle and thread mending a tear in fabric, closing it bit by bit. His body dissolving into the light.

"Please..." Dean begs, so quietly that even he can barely hear it. Cas's figure begins to fade, light dimming, the hole shrinking. But just before it's completely stitched shut by the bright light of grace, a slender thread of light detaches from the rest, flying toward Dean.

Dean watches it, dazed, not realizing his eyes are so teary that the light of the grace blurs and smears like soaked watercolor. The thin thread of light lands on his forehead, touches his skin, and immediately sinks in.

Warmth floods him from head to toe, like the best hot shower he could ever hope for in this moment, chasing out the last remnants of the storm's cold from his body. The exact same feeling as whenever Cas touches him, and heals him.

Dean looks up again. At the place where the tear of the space once was, there is now only a smooth stretch of open sky and air. There is no nasty thing from another dimension, there is no blinding light of needle and thread.

There is no Cas, again. Not even a sign to prove it wasn't a dream. Except for the lingering warmth still flowing through his body.

The raging snowstorm dies down, like the last drops of water sputtering from a faucet during an outrage. Then it stops completely. The world is fixed, at least this part of it, he realizes belatedly, when the tear is mended, when Cas is gone.

He stares at the sky as it clears. Blue as crystal. He blinks hard.

A piece of fabric drifts down from the middle of the air, slowly floating to the ground, landing on the snow. Beige-colored, trench coat texture, torn and bloodstained.

Dean picks it up, puts it into the chest pocket closest to his heart.

<br>

#### Act 4 (Cas POV)

It is dark.

This place.

It is shredding.

Cutting.

Confusing.

Everything is in pieces.

Then they are not.

Floating.

Swimming.

Chaotic.

The dimension in between.

<br>

It takes time, a really long time, to find the pieces together.

But what is time, when time is not a dimension?

When time, can also be torn apart, like everything else in here.

Words are difficult to find, with characters and syllables.

Mind and body and grace and existence alike.

Which is the right place, for which piece of the puzzle, floating by.

Woven, with pain and bitterness and guilt and penance.

Kneaded, into every fabric.

Every fabric of the dimension.

Every fabric of one existence.

*Who is building me up this time?*

*Not God. Me.*

*I'm putting me together.*

*But, then, Theseus's Ship,*

*Who am I?*

<br>

It is dark.

Behind the curtain.

Lights are out.

Tear it down.

No,

Tear it open.

The light is on the other side.

<br>

Then,

Snow and cold.

Pain and real.

Torn and broken.

*I see you.*

<br>

*Hello.*

*I'm sorry.*

The lights are out again.

The curtain is drawn back.

Too quick, too short.

Back, dark, torn, away.

*Don't cry.*

*Goodbye.*

### Chap. 2 Into the Woods (Birds)

> **Outline:** Dean follows giant monster witness report, rumor says Archaeopteryx (ancient first bird fossil) in place with huge tall trees (Redwood, California). Dean drives there, gets spooked, feels being watched but no one around, thinks he sees shape of giant Cas's wings in night black but disappear in blink (only get a glimpse), thinks he's going crazy, finds another tear of dimension and bloody feather in it (too big). almost gets killed by too many bloody vultures and gets saved by Cas, protected by six huge black wings (Cas wants to talk but only in true voice and too loud, breaks glasses, but Dean is sure by now it's Cas), Cas gets pulled away again as the tear closes
>
> [+Cas POV: can't talk, can't stay, self-aware weird shape, watch Dean from the other side, see him hurt and fight to force through to save, weakened by each attempt]

#### Act 1

He spends two days driving from Colorado to Louisiana, another two days from Louisiana to Michigan.

Dean can't help touching the piece of trench coat fragment in his pocket, as if it's heating up, burning against the skin where his heart beats. But it's just a piece of clothing.

The leaves of the trees grow wider and larger as he goes south, then thinner and taller again as he heads north.

The laptop search bar has a new frequent search term: "giant monster." It turns out people online are even more likely to report sightings of something huge and monstrous than something holy or hellish.

Dean picks the roads no one walks or drives, the roads in between trees and deep in the mountains. The mountains where legends say giant monsters and prehistoric creatures live.

He runs into a lone vampire making a living hunting bears, and a fairy living in the woods with a goat mask. But no more "yeti" or "bigfoot," and certainly no mention at all of any creature with trench coat-colored skin.

The snow starts melting by the roads of the Midwest and Great Lakes. It's been months since Rocky Mountain, even longer since Purgatory. Leviathans fade into the memory of a previous life, demons and Apocalypses are like stories told by other people.

Once, in the middle of the night, on his way to Montana, Dean finds himself wondering, if this is gonna be the rest of his life. Drifting on the road, searching, alone, not even hunting, not really. Just looking, finding, going after the angel he lost.

"Cas, what if the next time I find you is twenty years from now?" He ponders aloud, half speaking to himself, half praying, if this can still be called prayer. "What if you get pulled away again after that, and the next after is fifty years later. Or a hundred. What then?"

"I might end up in a trench somewhere one day, become some bones. Then who'll continue looking for you, to bring you home?"

Hours condense in nights like this, moving slowly, minute by minute. Words coagulate. But days and weeks flash by.

He has no answer. So he pushes the questions away. He could think of nothing but finding Cas when he was in Purgatory, and it is no different now. Even if it's going to take the rest of his life.

He hadn't planned on coming back to life on Earth anyway, back there, before he found Cas. Until he found him.

So here, now, on the Earth. It has to be easier. It has to be.

The road stretches ahead like used tapes rolling back in a cassette player, miles and miles left behind the wheels.

Cas is not in Montana, either. But he does run into more gods and such. Zeus and Prometheus die on the same day, and he gets to meet Artemis, the goddess of his occupation, supposedly the protector of all hunters. It isn't the worst day of his life, all things considered.

That is when Artemis tells him the legend of one giant ancient bird. After he asked nicely.

"There is this giant fish, born in the northern sea, its head to tail stretching thousands of miles. It turns into a giant bird, no one knows how big it is, must be tens of thousands of miles wide. When it flies, its wings spread like clouds covering the sky. When winter stirs the sea, it flies south. Its wings flap on the water, and the sea lifts waves three thousand miles high. It flies upwards, the swirl of its body creating tornados ninety thousand miles high in the sky. The wind and air are its breath, the blue in the sky the color of its feathers. The ancient Greeks and Chinese both had records of it thousands of years ago. Is this the ancient creature you're looking for?"

Dean swallows, thinking about the shadow of Castiel's wings on the barn walls the first day they met. "Maybe," he says. "Does this bird have a name?"

"Greeks and Egyptians call it Phoenix, Chinese call it Peng, archeologists call it Archaeopteryx, you're calling it Angel already. Does the name matter?"

Dean shakes his head, dumbly. "And where does it -- he, they -- live and rest? This northern sea it was born from, and the southern place it flies to, where are they?"

"It only rests on the oldest and tallest tree, thriving since the age of glaciers and dinosaurs, taking eight thousand years as spring, and eight thousand more for autumn."

Dean blinks blankly.

Artemis lets out a short sigh. "Redwood, California."

"Thank you!" Dean blurts out, "Next time, start with that! Now I can see why the Greeks have Minotaurs and Sphinxes."

<br>

#### Act 2

Artemis wasn't kidding when she said the trees were ancient. Only a few digits off, give or take, on the specific age.

The foresters say the oldest redwood in the park is at least two thousand years old.

Dean walks into the woods.

Surrounded by the trees towering over the land, rising into the sky, no human can avoid being reminded of how tiny they are. Dean is no exception.

He walks among them, awed and uneasy, taking it in slowly. He can't shake the feeling that eyes are looking down at him from above -- not like Cas's stares, but more like walking into a cobweb watched by massive spiders sitting in the center enjoying the view in silence. He doesn't know if it's the trees themselves, being too loud and alive, or something else perching on top. The instinct makes the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He tries to slow his breath.

The trunks of the redwoods sheer upward, chapped and crannied, too thick to be encircled by probably a dozen grown men. The crowns block out the sky, leaving the space beneath them dim and gloomy, with only flecks of sunlight flickering through the shifting leaves.

Dean walks deeper into the woods, eyeing around prudently, looking for any sign of one particular giant, feathery creature that is his friend.

Birds dart between the trunks, all the time. Big and small, red and white, chirping and humming. Woodhackers knock against the bark, hummingbirds linger in midair. Dean pays special attention to the ones in black -- though, when he thinks about it, he doesn't actually know the color of Cas's wings. He's only ever shown the shadow of them after all. Still, he imagines them shining a starry black, like the night sky.

Ravens and crows croak and squawk, soaring and gliding.

But none of them are more than a few inches in size. And none of them have a celestial vibe in them.

Maybe legends are just legends, meant to stay as mythological stories as they should be. There is no giant ancient bird, maybe there never was. Dean sighs, bitterly, not entirely surprised but still feels like a punch in the gut. He wonders if it's time to admit defeat in this phantom chase and call it a day. He starts looking for the way out.

Hours pass, Dean finds himself frustratingly circling round and round in the same spot. All the goddamn trees look exactly the same, tall and straight, featureless and faceless. He can't see a sign or a man-made trail. Or any other living breathing human being in sight.

The sun is setting fast. The dim light of day in the woods transitions into deepening shadows as the sun moves west. And then, night falls.

The charm and beauty of the forest vanish entirely as soon as utter darkness takes over. Nocturnal creatures wake up in the sound of branches cracking and owls hooting. Creatures, perhaps monsters too.

Dean reaches for the blade and flashlight in his pocket automatically, gripping them tight, alerted. This is how the feeling of deja vu starts seeping into reality.

The rustling of trees, the eerie deep calls from above, echo behind him, hanging over him three hundred and sixty degrees like a web. Everything feels so Purgatory-like that for a minute, he seriously wonders if he somehow mis-stepped through a hidden portal and went back to that nasty place again.

The giveaway is the sound of tiny small lives. Insects chanting clamorously in the grass, under thick layers of fallen leaves and soil. Something small and nimble runs and jumps around, climbing tree trunks, the sound of their clip-clops fine like rats on the floor, but it's probably squirrels or wild rodents. Purgatory doesn't have that much live, all it has is monsters with fangs and claws and an appetite for fresh meat.

Dean adjusts his gait, moving gingerly, trained and bridled. The light from the torch reaches no more than a few feet in front of him, before being swallowed by blackness and a thin white mist that is quickly thickening into dense fog.

And then there is the sound of wings fluttering. The air stirs, forming swirls of winds.

For the briefest moment, without thinking, Dean is thrilled. Turning on his heels earnestly, he calls, "Cas!"

A big black bird crashes into the beam of his flashlight, its wings so close to his face they nearly give him a slap. Startled by the light, it flaps the wings hard and shoots past him, flying toward the treetops, melting into the darkness of the night.

Dean notices its crooked beak held a shred of fresh meat, still dripping blood. *Must be a vulture,* he thinks, *enjoying its dinner in the wild woods.*

Nothing supernatural, just wildlife, the *natural* rule of the food chain. He warns himself. Could be just a dead animal from *natural* causes, or killed and eaten by a larger predator that's *also* just a *normal* wild animal.

He points the flashlight upward, squinting into the blackness, wondering where the bird went. The light fades into the night before it reaches the closest tree. Beyond the illuminated range, Dean thinks he has a glimpse of the silhouette of some huge dark wings, spreading out across and in between the trees, as huge and wide as the legend claims. He blinks, and the darkness is still just all black, no lines or shapes stand out. He shakes his head, distrusting his own eyes.

"Must be wishful thinking," he murmurs quietly, not wanting to be heard by whatever might be out there in the dark.

He walks in the direction the vulture came from. The coppery smell of blood gradually thickens, slowly saturating the air.

Taking in a slow breath and holding it, Dean shines the light on the ground. Two human bodies lie there, long dead. Their bodies have become a wild animal buffet, chests torn open, guts spilled, dragged across the earth, leaving a bloody trail through the leaves and grass. Their eyes have been pecked out, leaving two dark empty sockets.

"God damn it!" Dean covers his nose with the hand holding the flashlight, and follows the bloody trail.

Another shadow of black wings sweeps past him, barely beyond the light, but judging by its shape and size, it's a second vulture.

Then a third.

Then another.

Another dozen, another hundred, another thousand.

The farther he walks, the more he runs into. Wild wings flap around him like bats disturbed in a cave. Those raptors are practically bumping into each other now, whooshing and wheezing, pecking and jabbing, clutching and scraping. They are like bees from a shattered hive, moths drawn to flame, ducks startled in a pond, filling the space between the trees in a frenzied swarm. They fly around him, then at him. Beaks and claws strike, sharp as knives and blades, hard as iron hooks.

Something is definitely not right. Dean doesn't watch the Nature Channel as much as Cas, but with what common sense he does have about wild creatures -- plus the few times that he gave up opposing and ended up watching with Cas in some motel -- vultures aren't supposed to attack living things, and they definitely don't travel in this large number of crowds. Scavengers eat leftovers, not hunting for fresh takeout, kinda like ghouls.

And how the hell are there suddenly so many of them and so very deadly, and no one ever mentioned or noticed it?

Dean waves the blade at the few getting too close to his face, shouting loudly to shoo them away. But it is in vain, doesn't even remotely scare them. The ones hit by his blade flinch back, but more immediately fill their place, coming at him fiercely, claws cutting into his skin, beaks mere inches from pecking his eyes out.

He covers his face with his arms, feeling his jacket and shirt on the outer side of his arms and back ripped quickly, skin torn and pulled, flesh gouged, blood streaming hot. His hand still grips the demon blade, but he has no idea what good one blade does against a thousand wild human-killing flesh-eating vultures. He doesn't even have a single chance to outrun them. The bloody things have wings.

Dean had done his fair share of research before entering the woods, just to be sure. As eager as Dean was to come into the place searching, he knows how to do his job, so he came prepared -- the best he could, just in case the story of the giant bird turned out to be something in his wheelhouse and needs to be killed. Bird-like flying thing with wings, it could be an angel, *the* angel, but it could also be a Harpy (a half-human half-bird creature from Greek myth), or Thoth (god of moon with a head of an ibis from Egypt), or a Valravn (a magical supernatural big raven from Danish folklore), or one of several other options. From what he read, silver knives and iron blades for decapitation should work well on most of them, while some others could use a stab to the heart to stop the kicking. He memorized the incantations for the very rare ones that needed spellwork to cast away. He had walked into this forest of redwoods with confidence.

He never thought it would be this. Nothing really too supernatural, if not counting the sheer number, it's just freaking wild animals. Vultures. Countless of them. *Really should be careful what you wish for.*

In the frantic sound of wings flapping, in the middle of being devoured and eaten alive, Dean thinks of the bug case all those years ago. The one with the Native American curse, one of the very few where he and Sam never really solved the root of the problem. They helped the family live through the day, wear through the night; all they could do was manage not die, wait out until the sun rose, nothing but to wait for the bugs to retreat on their own. The curse from the native Americans, the nature did all the bidding and revenge -- they could do absolutely nothing to fight it. And Dean could have died at the age of twenty-six, because of bugs.

And now, here he is. After the archangels, after the leviathans, and vampires, and werewolves, after all the monsters Purgatory could come up with and throw at him and he walked out fine and intact, *this* is the thing that gets him finally. He doesn't have the faintest idea how to possibly fight back against mother nature that throws a thousand vultures on him.

Dean lowers his body, curling up instinctively, trying to protect his internal organs. He can barely feel the pain from where the beaks pierce -- he might not have much skin left to pass the sense of pain to the brain. He can feel those bloody birds cutting through his flesh like knives through butter, peeling and pulling his skin, gouging and poking his scalp, wrenching and dragging tendons, digging and jabbing as deep as bones.

He doesn't feel much pain, gradually. He only feels hot and warm across his skull, cold and wet on his back. He smells blood and flesh, he hears the sound of his own flesh being pulled away from his body bit by bit. A vulture flies off with its trophy and the next one dives in for their turn of bite at the buffet. He thinks of those two corpses he saw earlier, knowing far too clearly he has witnessed his own future already.

"I'm going to die," he shuts his eyes tight, thinking, miserably. "I'm going to die like an old dog in the wild, eaten clean by some birds. Not even any bone left behind. God, no one will even know how. Sam might find the car, and Cas... Oh Cas..."

Dean feels his chest seize, a sob choked in his throat. He can't breathe.

#### Act 3 (not break)

A loud flutter of wings adds to the sounds of millions of wings crashing and rustling, so loud and powerful it distinguishes itself from all the others. A strong gust sweeps through, sending the vultures perched on his back with claws digging into his spine blown away. The ones pecking at his arms lose their grip too, spreading their wings to keep balance. The edges and feathers of the wings brush against his open wounds, sending involuntary shudders through his body.

The surrounding sounds suddenly quiet. For a moment, Dean thinks if it might be his ears suddenly deafened, like a TV muted all of a sudden. But then he realizes the sound of wings is still there, though farther away, remote, distant, like behind a closed soundproof door. The sensation of feathers and wings is still on his skin -- which, remarkably, looks like he has skin again, at the places he was sure  were bleeding like a drained pipe mere seconds ago -- warm and soft.

The broken bones start to grow back, the torn tendons knitting back together, blood flowing through the veins smoothly, the skin feels new and tight. The cold wet sensation on his spine recedes, so does the burning dumbness on the back of his head. There is only a lingering familiar lukewarm touch on his skin exposed through the torn cloth, a careful fluffy sensation that is barely there.

It is not the vulture wings touching him. It is not.

Dean opens his eyes, lowering his arms. He is surrounded by something warm and vast, wrapped in it like the best natural feathery quilt, covered from head to toe like a cocoon, but with enough space to move too, not confined, but safe. No one could ever hurt him here, he knows instantly, not vultures, not any monster, not even God or Death themselves, Dean just knows.

It is dark, but through the faint flashlight he dropped inches from his feet, he sees the wings around him aren't pure black. They glitter with tiny little shine of silvery light, like the finest diamonds inlaid between the feathers. The most beautiful thing he's ever seen.

Dean doesn't need anything else to know who it is.

"Cas." He reaches out a hand, can't stop himself.

For a blink of time, he imagines there is nothing, just another dying hallucination, just his last warm mad dream like the pity Little Match Girl. But his fingertips land on the feathers. Soft at the tip, tender in the middle, strong at the root, disarranged under his touch. He takes a long breath in, and he smells sky.

"Cas, is that really you? These your wings?" His voice is still a bit shivering, wet. "So you're -- you're okay. More than okay. The wings, oh God, I never know they look like this, up close, I mean."

He takes another long drag of broken breath, feeling his heartbeat finally begin to slow, his brain dizzy from the adrenaline. Dean murmurs, quietly, "They're so beautiful, Cas. They're amazing."

He presses both palms on the wings in front of him, feeling the warmth that is slightly higher than his own passing onto the hollows of his hands. He might be imagining it, but underneath it, he feels a pulse. A living, pumping, steady pulse, beating in the rhythm of an elephant's heartbeat, the slow pace of a giant creature. He buries his fingers in, letting the feathers intertwine with the fingers, watching them part to allow his fingers to sink deeper into the sea of black feathers. For this moment, Dean feels safe, even if he knows he must be far from it, even if in his whole life, he never has truly been.

"This giant ancient bird Artemis told me about, thousands of miles wide and thousands of miles tall, stirring sea and sky, it's you, isn't it?" Dean tries hard to steady his breath, feeling proud. "I know it! I know it all along."

Cas doesn't answer.

In fact, Cas hasn't said a word or even shown his face, it is only the wings that Dean sees.

Only then does he realize that, and starts to frown. "Cas, buddy, I want to see you. What happened? Come down here, talk to me."

There is a high-pitched voice in a deafening volume rolling above his head, piercing the air in response. The same sound that blew up the glasses in the gas station the day he crawled out of his grave, back on Earth from the Pit tour. Castiel's true voice.

Dean covers his ears until the voice and echo between trees silences. "You can't speak human now?" He guesses, then adds quickly. "Okay, let's do this, knock once for no, knock twice for yes, we'll figure out other things later. Right or wrong, Cas? True-voice-only time?"

The wing wrapped closest to him moves, pulling away from him, the tip of it knocks on the ground twice.

Dean lets out a relieved chuckle. "Now we're talking. Good to see you again, Cas." He talks to the black wings in front of him, gesturing vaguely upward, feeling only a little weird. "Some part of you, anyway."

He tilts his head. "Hey, what's the deal with this *Amazing Colossal Man* show?"

Dean looks up, but can't seem to look beyond where Cas's wings cover. He can't tell if the blackness over his head is wing or night.

The tip of the wing that was responsible for tapping the ground for an answer hesitates. It draws a curve on the ground, then a point -- a question mark.

Dean can practically hear Cas's voice -- his low gravelly human voice -- saying, "I don't understand that reference," just from that movement.

He can't help feeling the tug at the corner of his mouth. "Anyway, thanks for saving my ass, again. You got any idea what's up with those killer birds out there?"

The hesitation again. Dean watches the wing tip shift like a human wrestling fingers in the grill of a difficult question. But then, it taps twice on the ground.

Dean claps his hands together with relief. "Great! Mind showing me?"

There is a brief high-pitched growling sound overhead again. Still completely unintelligible to human ears, but somehow, Dean thinks, he senses something edgy and pained just from the sound of it. His heart clenches at the feeling of it, even if he has no idea of the meaning.

"Or not, if it's... making you uncomfortable," he tries, regretting the question.

Slowly, the wrapped layers of wings around him begin to withdraw -- Dean misses them the moment they pull away. From the outermost to the innermost where the feathers slightly brush against his back and shoulders, they unfold. One wing after another.

There are three pairs.

As tall as the redwoods surrounding them, as wide as the open space allows. From where Dean stands, he can't see from one end to the other, and his human brain can't seem to comprehend the shape in between that holds the wings together. Must be something celestial, he decides, something that is the true Cas.

The wings flap once, all three pairs together. A gusty blow of strong wind sweeps through the woods, shaking trunks and crowns, leaves falling like downpouring rain. Those vultures that are as big as half his height with wings longer than his arms, just get blown away like small gnats puffed away by a huff of air, finally leaving behind a small circle of clearing. But Dean can hear them steady and ready to fly back at any time.

Cas flaps his wings again. Then a third time.

But even he can't keep that up forever.

With each flap, his wings shift direction, sending gust swirling in all directions, circling around something.

Something too dark to be made out in the forest night. Dean points the flashlight in that direction, widening his eyes then squinting, looking hard, trying to see what's there.

Then he sees it. A tear in space, not too different from the one he saw last time when Cas emerged in the snowstorm, but the tear was easier to notice in the all white background than the all black one like right now.

But it is the same shape of wound that tears the reality, an opening leading to somewhere unknown, somewhere that probably doesn't belong to any space at all. The vultures pour from the tear faster than shooting bullets, flying out like the most annoying insects in the world.

Judging by the moment of the wings, Castiel is tiring out fast. He retreats closer to the gap step by step. Dean tries to move toward him.

Cas lowers one of the lowest wings, putting it right in his way, sending a clear enough message of warning him from another step forward. And Dean can see why. There are too many killer birds at the center. If the ones attacking him earlier were giving him a hard time, going any closer could mean being torn apart by a tornado of beaks in an instant. Not even Cas could heal him fast enough if that ever happened.

He stays where that wing instructs him to. The feeling of helplessness comes back. The same feeling he had when he was in that snowstorm on the Rocky Mountain, the same gut-tightening instinct of what is going to happen next as the wings inch closer to the tear.

"You're leaving again, aren't you?" Dean asks him, frowning deeply, eyes stinging. Not expecting any answer. Because they both already know.

The wing tip bends slightly, wrapping around him briefly -- the closest thing to a farewell hug. A feather brushes his face, right at the corner of his eye. Dean swallows. There is no tear, he knows there isn't, not now anyway.

His hand reaches up, feeling the touch of the feather, leaning into it.

"Did Purgatory do this to you? Pulling you here and there? Making these whatever weirdass portals all over? God, I have so many questions." Dean feels the twist in his stomach tighten, the knot turning over. He thinks he's gonna be sick.

His voice drops quieter. "Do you choose to leave, or do you have to, Cas?" He pushes the words out, tasting the edge of them, each as sharp as the knives and blades and the beaks of those birds, cutting his tongue and throat bloody. "I fight so damn hard, just want you back, want you stay, want you okay. Is that too much to ask?"

The shrieking angelic voice that answers him is even more pained than the previous one he heard. Dean can't imagine what it is that Cas is saying.

The vultures gather back closer as Cas's wings flap increasingly slower and visibly more exhausted and heavy. One of the creatures lands its claws on his wings in the mid-sky, and more follow. A burst of new smell of copper and iron floods the air. A rain of crimson starts to fall to the ground.

Dean yells, "Cas, watch out!" But there is nothing he can do. He holds the demon blade up in a posture of throwing it out, but he can't be sure it wouldn't hit Cas instead. Some of the birds hover back, diving in his direction. Feet away, then inches.

That is when Cas starts glowing. Not too different from last time on the snow mountain, except a lot more intense. Dean shuts his eyes the moment the light brightens up, starting at the outline of the wings.

His brain itches to steal a look, to see the wings in light. He imagines them like a phoenix reborn in fire (a drastic brilliant light show as the legends speak of, as that tremendous bird would be like, not the man-shaped creature from the Wild West), but Cas would definitely be pissed -- pissed at himself, that is -- if Dean gets his eyes burned out because of his grace, even if it's Dean's own stupid curiosity.

The bright light scorches the backs of his eyelids hot and red, like facing straight at the sun with closed eyes. He waits, heart pounding loud in his chest. He listens, the sound of wings wanes and subsides, the warm and soft touch of feathers withdraws.

Dean opens his eyes when he can't hear any more fluttering. His vision still overstimulates and shakes with a too bright overlay, making the darkness before him even harder to make out. He blinks and rubs at his eyes, clearing the water forming slowly that must be triggered from the bright light, not from whatever breathless slump inside his chest.

There is no scar of the space left, there is no giant black wing. No more human-eating killer vultures. No Cas.

A crow tentatively croaks, hopping in the grass, then flies off. That is all.

In the place where there was the opening, on the ground, lying on top of the thick coating of fallen leaves, there is a single long feather.

As long as his forearm. As black as the starry sky with glittering light between. A hint of blood stains the tip.

Cas's feather.

Dean's fingers caress the feather, ever so softly, so lightly. Just like the way the wings it belonged to touched his cheek mere moments ago. Ever so gently. The touch of a phantom hand, reaching from a distant forgotten dream.

He presses the feather to his lips, then puts it next to the piece of trench coat fabric. His heart beats a skin's distance away.

<br>

#### Act 4 (Cas POV)

The dimension in between is -- for lack of a better word -- confusing. It's kaleidoscopical, it's a meat grinder of light and darkness and everything in between, a blender of color and shape, a garbage disposal of mind and body.

Starting with darkness, then lights from other dimensions start flashing in, like stars from the other side of a curtain, then brighter than sunshine.

It takes forever to find words and thoughts again, to find the pieces that belong to oneself and put them back together. It takes longer to see the lights, to watch them glow and shine, and even longer to realize what they are.

Prayers can't reach this dimension, yearning does. The stronger the emotion, the brighter the lights. It starts with sparkles, the brightness of comets, on and off, flickering, blinking, flying past; then grows to that of Mercury and Venus, as they're seen from Earth; soon becomes as anchoring and grounding as Polaris in Ursa Minor, as bright and consistent as Orion and Perseus; until eventually, it is supernova explosion.

There is a similarity between this place and deep space in the more familiar dimension.

It feels familiar. It feels like home.

It takes a while, but the realization finally dawns: *Why are the lights so bright, so calling, so intense that I want nothing but to stare into it, to go after it, to merge into them -- because it is a beacon, sent by the one human being who anchors my existence, who lights the way back. It is Dean, calling for me.*

<br>

The barrier that divides the dimensions, is nearly impossible to tear open. It is no cotton fabric of a curtain, it is as thin as air but one cannot slice air with any blade, so it might as well be a diamond wall, infinitely thick.

There is no way through -- none that I can manage by myself.

But I'm not doing it by myself.

I can't hear him, can't really see clearly enough of his whereabouts, but the light of emotion radiating from him, directly coming from his beating heart, that is all I ever need.

When the light bursts so bright and desperate, it changes colors, it shines red and bloody, like a wound of the space. Like the bleeding mark on the chest of a thorn bird, whose final song echoes with a sonorous melody as the sharpest thorn pierces its heart. The power and intensity are so strong and insistent, they can cut through everything.

They cut the divide thin, I push through. There he is, Dean. But dying. Almost always, dying. Even more so, when I'm around.

More so, when the tear is open, and danger seeps through.

I watch myself, stepping over the tear. Hands, feet, cloth; wings, rings, eyes. The vessel, the angel, the monster, the bad luck. These days, it seems, I'm always the combination of all of these. The eye of the disaster storm, the reason Dean is in danger.

"I'm here now," I want to say. The sound comes out harsh and sharp, too loud for human ears. Dean's hands cover his ears. I'm hurting him again. It seems, I'm always hurting him, one way or another.

I mute my own voice, ignoring the chanting deep within, repeating Dean's name. Ache. It doesn't matter. I don't matter. It should be about Dean. It's always all about Dean.

"Stay," I hear him say. Half from his lips, half from prayer, reaching deep into my core.

"I need you," I hear him think. Don't need to invade his mind, the thought is already loud enough.

*What do you need me for, Dean?* I wonder. I heal him. I help him to his feet. I wipe his tears. The ones haven't fallen yet.

I put my wings around him, leaning into the warmth of the human body. Greedily. Selfishly.

Taking in his whole existence, feeling his touch, grasping the memory. Getting prepared.

*I miss you too.* I'm thinking. Never told him, never going to.

*I'm sorry.* I see blood. Then I see tears.

I see danger. And I see pain. The bright light in his soul, never more blinding.

Why is the word "tear" both the sad salty water like the sea, and the broken wound that never truly heals? Because they're, really, the very same thing.

A doorway opens in two directions: one way out, the other to keep Dean safe.

A crossroads.

Think carefully, choose wisely.

It is an easy one, really.

Me, or him.

It is never a decision that needs pondering.

Stepping aside, stepping back.

Wound of the dimension, fixed by a body already broken -- sounds poetically fair. And perfect for penance.

I am back where I was. The deforming, confusing place. The dimension in between.

I still hear the crying. His calling.

The sound of tears dropping.

And the beat of his heart.

<br>

### Chap. 3 Amid the Tears (Missouri)

> **Outline:** Dean goes to Missouri, Pamela's seance had witnessed Cas's true form in multidimension then so can Missouri (use feather&coat fabric as medium), Dean gets info/theory that Cas's true form and vessel are spliced and he's stuck, swears to find&help him.
>
> [+Cas's POV: meet with Missouri in seance, Dean's spirit into the same dimension, can talk, can't see, Cas hesitant to come back because not want to continue tear dimension to endanger reality & hurt Dean (self blame, guilty)]
>
> Dean determined to find Cas in real world again

#### Act 1

Dean parks the car by the roadside, sitting behind the wheel a moment too long, chewing on the words he might need later. The house looks the same as it did the last time he visited almost a decade ago.

He checks through the curtained window, wondering if the owner is in the house now.

He raises a hand, the front door opens before his knuckles reach it.

"Dean Winchester." The woman regards him, a small smile forming.

"Missouri." Dean returns the smile, leaning in to give her a hug.

"It's been so long." Her hands pat his back gently, then pull away. Her eyes are sharp and pointed, but now softened by a knowing, compassionate look. "I'm sorry about the angel."

Dean raises his eyebrows.

"You were just thinking about him," Missouri eases into the room, ushering him in. "In fact, I think that's all you can think about. Am I right?"

Dean swallows, lowering his eyes to the floor, letting his feet carry him through the place automatically. "Yeah, uh, yeah, he's the reason why I... Sorry I didn't visit earlier."

Missouri sets a cup of coffee in front of him, didn't ask if he wanted tea or anything. Dean takes it, appreciated.

"Eight years ain't a short time, but I understand," she says, settling onto the couch across the small coffee table. "Your father sat in that very spot right after the fire, and I told him what he needed to know. How can I help you, Dean?"

Dean's mind falters for a second at that, old memories of his Dad and Mom and the haunted old house flood back in, but he gives a long exhale and pushes them down. "Cas is not dead," he says, defensive. Not like Mom. And he's not his Dad. "I just need some help to bring him back, that's all."

Missouri nods once, silent, her eyes prompting him to continue.

"There was an old friend a few years ago, a really good real-deal psychic," Dean remembers Pamela's bright flirtatious smiles, then the burned-out eye sockets, then bleeding stab wounds in her stomach. He has to force down a flinch. "That was way before we knew anything about angels, and she set up this seance, demanding Cas show his face. It didn't end well," he swallows again, "but it worked. I think Cas actually showed up and talked to her in some psychic spiritual dimension."

"And you're wondering if I can do something similar and let you talk to Castiel the same way," Missouri finishes for him.

Dean nods quietly. "Can you do that?" He tries hard not to let the desperation and hope spill all over in his voice, but Missouri probably hears it all.

She considers, eyes searching his face. And whatever she finds there, it seems to satisfy a question she didn't ask.

"Yes, I suppose," she says. Dean lets out a long breath. "There will be risks, but it can be done. It would be easier if there's something I can use as a medium."

"Medium?"

"Something from the angel. Things he can recognize as his, to guide his way to the call," Missouri explains.

That rings a bell. Dean automatically touches the handprint on his left shoulder beneath his jacket, knowing the red burning mark is still there. Back then, that mark was all they had that has a direct link to Cas, but now, he has more.

Dean reaches into his inner chest pocket, putting the trench coat fragment and the blood-stained black feather on the table between them. His fingers linger at the edge of the feather, not leaving. Both of them still carry the same temperature from his body warmth.

"I have these," he tells Missouri. "Cas left them behind when, emm, the last two times we saw each other, right before he disappeared. Will they work?"

Missouri reaches out to touch the cloth. Dean's fingers twitch involuntarily like he has the strongest urge to snatch it back, to not allow anyone but himself touch it, or even see it, but he holds the hands where they should be.

"I believe so." Missouri stands from the couch. Dean follows the motion without thinking. The woman eyes his eagerness. "A seance requires certain preparations. I would've said I'd let you know when it's ready, but I think you can't stand just sitting here drinking coffee, so might as well come over and make yourself useful. Help me set it up."

"Yes, Ma'am." Dean nods gratefully.

They use the round dining table for the work, Dean watches as Missouri paints a pentagon that covers the whole surface, then adds Enochian symbols and some loosely familiar marks on four of the corners, with the last corner marked by a painted open eye. Dean looks at it, having an odd feeling that it's staring back at him.

"What do those symbols mean?" He can't help asking. Call it a work habit.

Missouri lights five candles in the center matching each corner while she answers. "The air, the earth, the fire, the water. All the basic elements. And this, is your door." She points at the eye. "The seance itself is actually not complicated, the difficult part is finding him and talking to him, if he is willing to show."

"That reminds me, the accident last time, Cas's true form burned that friend of mine's eyes out," Dean admits, a little guiltily, glancing at the symbol of the eye again, remembering Pamela's scream and the fire bursting from her sockets, the fake white eyeballs she had to wear later. "Probably don't look at him directly then."

But still, somehow, his mind wanders afar, wondering what it is that Pamela really saw -- a figure as tall as the Chrysler Building like Cas once so casually slipped? A light as bright and burning hot as the sun which no human should face directly? If there has to have one good thing to come out of that blindness, he hopes Pamela at least had the chance to see the most bright and beautiful thing in the whole universe before losing her sight.

"Good to know," Missouri replies, her tone flat. "But I ain't gonna be the one looking, you are."

"What?"

"I believe he'd be more willing to come and talk to you than to me," Missouri states, matter-of-fact. "I'll lead the way, and you can have some catch-up."

"How does it work? Some kind of out-of-body spirit-walking experience?" Dean frowns.

"Only the eyes of your mind will travel, going into the dimension where he is," Missouri answers briefly, as if this is enough to understand how psychics work.

Dean figures there is no point asking for more details, he'll find out soon enough.

They sit at the table, holding hands. Dean takes the seat right in front of the painted eye. The trench coat fragment rests in their joined hands on Dean's left side, the feather on the right.

Missouri closes her eyes. Dean glances at the candle flames until they leave a flickering burns in his vision, he shuts his eyes as well.

"Castiel, come to us before this circle," Missouri begins, her voice slow and steady. "Dean Winchester requests your appearance."

Dean's heart skips a beat at the mention of his own full name. He stares into the blackness behind his eyelids, thinking hard: *Cas, come on. I'm here, where are you?*

Missouri repeats the chanting. Dean prays alongside her voice, as if it's a chanting of his own.

"Castiel, come to us before this circle."

*Cas, come to me, please.*

"Dean Winchester requests your appearance."

*Talk to me, what happened?*

"Castiel, come to us."

*I need you. Please.*

The candle lights in the center of the table start flickering violently. A high-pitched sound begins, quiet and distant at first, then increases its volume rapidly as if the source is approaching, something flying closer. The air vibrates with electricity. Light bulbs nearby explode. The table shakes violently.

Dean holds his breath.

<br>

#### Act 2 (Cas POV → both POV)

Blinks of shallow light flash by, then disappear like comets. Clouds of light expand and shrink like nebulas. Clusters of light form and dissipate like constellations. Each one a burst signal, sent across all time and all space.

Castiel stands in the dimension in between -- floating, more like -- as if he's adrift in deep space. Stars and sparks, here and there. He scans the crowds of light from one cluster to another, gauging their brightness, their warmth, their color. Guessing. Wondering.

His eyes are sad, but not devastated. Longing, but he stays where he stands. Just watching. Always watching. Looking at the lights like looking at the way home but he cannot go. Staring, as if they are the eyes of the person he shares a profound bond with but he cannot follow. Standing still, like a stone sculpture of a guardian angel that he once so deeply believed he was, he still wishes to believe.

One flicker of light in the distance starts to brighten up quickly, drawing his attention.

Cas lifts his gaze, wondering what time and space that light belongs to. Its intensity keeps growing, the prayer and the yearning behind it aggregating stronger, ever more urgent. Cas gets worried. Dean prays the hardest when he's in greatest danger.

Cas starts moving toward the light.

It only flares stronger and brighter as he approaches, as if it senses him and reacts frantically. The closer he gets, the clearer it shows. With its color, its shape, and all the emotion of the human behind that light of yearning.

The light is dazzling green now. The color of emerald, of deepest forest, of bottled absinthe. The color of Dean's eyes. All too familiar. Irresistible.

The biggest, greenest eye, floating in the space. But nothing else. Formed by pure light.

And then, his voice comes through, like a broken phone line with bad signal, the sound is distorted, clipped, on and off, in and out, but it's undeniably Dean's, mixed with a woman's magical chanting, forming a power of magnetic pull.

"Come to me." He makes out Dean's words. Near begging. Like every night when they were in Purgatory. Back then, he used to say, "I'll find you" and "We'll go home together".

Castiel feels his heart tighten with the overwhelming desperate urge to answer. He wants nothing more than to follow the voice, to do as told, go to him, to see his smile, to embrace him with arms around his back, tight, to feel the warmth and strength. But he can't. He can't.

He had Leviathans on his tail back then. And now, the cracks when he crosses the border, it seems they always tear the space apart and keep leaking danger and evil into the world, with Dean at the forefront. He barely managed to protect him and stop the damage the last two times, he doesn't know if he can do it again, or if he should.

The thought of bringing monsters to Dean. The thought of his own very existence being close to Dean could put him in danger is a near-unbearable torment. But in the face of Dean's safety, everything else can wait. Everything bubbling and stretching and screaming inside his own chest, begging for his own mind's permission, can wait.

Castiel stops himself when he's a few steps away from that bright light. Listening to the voices, holding himself back, forcing himself to not move ahead another step. Because if he does, he wouldn't be able to stop at the next, or the next.

Dean's voice echoes in the dimension.

"Cas." He's calling.

Castiel closes his eyes.

Sinking into the voice. Forcing his body still. Breathing out, long and shaky.

<br>

The blackness behind his eyelids is not pure black anymore, it seems. As the table and the candle flames shake harder, there are glimmers of sparks shining within the black curtain like summer night's fireflies, like scattered sparks after a gunshot.

Dean stares at them hard, eyes widening and squinting though his lids remain closed. He sees the lights shifting, wondering if it's his imagination or if the candlelight has somehow grown strong enough to burn through his eyelids.

Or, is it the mysterious psychic dimension Missouri said she could bring him to, the one where he should go ahead looking for Cas?

He feels light and heavy at the same time. His vision blurs and clears. He's no longer sure if his eyes are open or closed anymore.

Dean glances down at himself. There is no body, nothing to control to navigate around the space, only the view ahead. Like a lazily designed first-person video game.

All he can do is look, and think.

So he thinks hard: "*Cas.*" He focuses on the syllables, imagining how his own tongue and throat would produce the sound, deliver the name.

"*Cas --*"

"*Cas!*"

He repeats the name over and over, shouting in his mind like a rescue team calling out to a lost traveler deep in the wilderness, wondering if there is any chance the seance could actually work, if Cas is really here and can hear him.

The high-pitched sound he heard back in Missouri's room earlier is muffled now, quieter, lower. Gradually, more human, more recognizable.

Until finally, he hears Cas's words.

"Dean." Cas is answering his call. But he can't pin his sound.

"Where are you?" Dean can't help glancing around. But the closer he looks, the more confused he gets. His brain can't make sense of the shapes and figures his eyes receive, light and shade shifting like a kaleidoscope. He catches a glimpse of a loose blue thread, a button, a feather, then something glittering metallic. Then an eye, floating, blinking, staring at him, not connected to a body. Blue.

What is this, a space dumpster from some horror movie? *Interstellar* but B-rated version? Dean muses, more taken aback than dread.

"This is the dimension in between other dimensions," Cas answers him, his voice coming from all directions, echoing in a space that doesn't seem to have a boundary.

Dean tries to move his eyes around, looking for him, but the view only makes his mind reel.

"Don't look back. Please," Cas's voice turns into an anxious warning, coming from behind him. Dean doesn't have a body to turn around. He can't see him, but somehow, he thinks -- he feels, he can sense that weight of presence beyond his vision, looming over. Like the brush of wings wrapping around him. And he knows instantly, with one hundred percent certainty, it is Cas, right there behind him, just out of his view.

"You shouldn't come any closer. You shouldn't have even come here at all, Dean." Cas's voice tired and uneasy, drifting over the back of his head. "My form here can hurt you, just by existing in the same plane. I don't want to make the same mistake I did with Pamela Barnes again."

Dean gives a silent sigh, resigned to settle with voice-only FaceTime. "How are you, Cas?"

"Fine," Cas replies flatly.

Dean manages to convey a mental eyebrow raise. *Of course.*

"You've been here the whole time? After Purgatory?"

"Most of the times I can remember, yes. I don't remember the earliest times at the beginning when the portal tore my mind apart, along with everything else." Cas tells him, his voice stable, but Dean knows the undercurrent he heard from the voice isn't his imagination.

"I'm sorry." Dean finds the words coming through the mind easily.

"It's not your fault," Cas says quickly. "You couldn't have known the portal would do that."

"How bad is it?"

Cas hesitates. The silence stretches, Dean's nerves go tense. "Cas? You still there?"

"Yes." Cas answers from behind him, somewhere high.

"So? How bad?"

Cas sighs, the sound resigned. "The portal only works on pure humans, so I think it tried to parse out the human part of me to throw out, and keep the rest behind. So my human body, the vessel, and my essence in the true form, they were shattered --"

Dean's breath hitches.

Cas continues, "Every sense of me was in pieces earlier, at the beginning, it was even more difficult than --" He pauses briefly there, as if debating whether he wants to tell the whole story, then he's decided. "-- more difficult than when I took over the broken pieces from Sam's mind, and had to rebuild everything in my head."

"Cas..." Dean starts, but doesn't know what to say after that, doesn't know if there is any word existed in the world that could mean anything here, or could express the tight, gut-wrenching feeling rising inside him.

"But it's already a lot better now, if it's any comfort." Cas makes his voice light, Dean only tastes bitterness in the words.

The blue thread is from the tie, the button from the shirt, the feather from the wings, the eye from the body. The things he saw in this space earlier suddenly make sense now.

Bits and pieces. All Cas's. All shattered. God knows how many more are not even visible.

"Cas," Dean grits his teeth, asking, slowly, "the human part and angel part... it's not just about the body and the wings, is it?"

The emotions and the feelings and the doubts, those are definitely things human minds tend to produce. And then there must be some memories and knowledge only belongs to the angel part. Then separating them apart would mean...

"It is not," Cas says gloomily, "But it's okay --"

"No, it's not." Dean cuts his words off. "Cas, damn it, stop saying you're okay when you're not. We're in this together, alright? I promised I'd get you home, so I will. Getting your ass out of Purgatory didn't go as planned -- fine. Let's just fix whatever this shitty dimension's problem is, and get over it. But I can't help if I don't know where to start. So why don't you give me a 101 go-over on the multidimension thing, and we'll see how to fix the problem? What do you say, Angel?"

There is a sound of cloth and wings rustling behind him. Dean feels a surge of urge to turn around, to look at him in the eyes and see him nod, even if it would burn his own eyes out. And right then, he hears Cas murmur, "Okay." Dean breathes out, echoing the same, long, relieved, "Okay."

Cas starts: "My true form is a multidimensional wavelength celestial being, not bound to Earth, while my body is composed of atomic vibrations and electron clouds in the material plane. Think of it as the *Wave-Particle Duality* in the quantum physics your species discovered a century ago. I believe I'm currently suffering from the *Refraction and Diffraction Effect*. And the boundary of this liminal dimension has an *Infinity Mirror Effect* when it interacts with any other dimensions. There are wave functions to explain more precisely --"

"Jesus, Cas, aim lower!" Dean rolls his eyes like they are standing face to face talking in their usual forms. "I said 101, not top-secret advanced science lecture. I dropped out of high school, for Christ's sake. Any chance I can get that in English again?"

"Going through that portal affected me in all forms. It tore me apart, sending me into the dimension between planes." Cas sighs in frustration. "I have tried to put myself back together, but this dimension throttles the effort, splicing my true form with the vessel, deforming me into something misshaped and giant."

Dean winces, remembering the huge trench coat shape against the snowstorm and the wings spread so wide he couldn't see the edges, taking over all the space between the redwoods. *Giant, no kidding. He hasn't gotten a single full-body shot of Cas ever since Purgatory.*

"What's dragging you away?" He remembers the openings mid-air, edges like wounds in space; remembers Cas stepping toward them, toward the eye of the tornado where the deadliest things came through most fiercely; then his grace weaving into the tear, gone from sight. Leaving Dean alone, shaking, with nothing but exhaustion and bitterness.

"Law of physics?" Cas offers.

There is no visible deadbeat badass entity in this space, not while they have been here talking for so long. No evil beings cutting them off, no one (hopefully) eavesdropping. No one running the place except the natural order. *Huh.*

*The easiest and toughest rule to break, then.*

"Cas," Dean steadies his spiraling thoughts, asking the most important question, the only question that's echoed in his mind every day and night since Purgatory, since before that. "How can I get you back? The whole, complete, normal, you. Not bits and pieces, not glimpses here and there." *Not broken, not crazy, not amnesia. Just, Cas.*

Cas falls quiet. After a long pause, his voice finally echoes on top of Dean's head again: "I don't know."

*Don't know if it's possible, if they can find a way, or don't know if he really wants to come back?* Dean decides not to ask.

He tells him this, instead: "I'll think of something. We'll figure it out. We always do. Hang in there tight, Cas. I got you."

<br>

### Chap. 4 At the World's End (Lights)

> **Outline:** Dean drive around, get djinn case nightmare of losing Cas in loop, forced to let Cas go to leave the djinn vision, get totally messed up and incredible amount of nightmare (has seen Cas in seance only make nightmares worse). desperate enough to try demon deal, get idea of expel+summon to bound, need more details to exec the idea. Dean find Meg, get angel exorcism spell, know the catch is his own sacrifice. Dean goes on his own quiet farewell trip to Sam etc., then go to Alaska to find Cas.
>
> In Alaska (world's end), keeps getting spooky feeling of continuously being watched, hears local legend of Cthulhu (otherworldly god-like, humanoid, huge, tentacle, incomprehensible, hundreds of meters tall), sees weird/astonishing aurora lights on sky (abnormalcy is massive light & color in sky, beautiful, astonishing), drives to the most north end point of the map. midnight, empty road, tear opens, sees giant Cas manifest in full size right in front of impala, wings+rings with eyes+trench coat everything. Dean shocked/terrified/in awe.
>
> [+Cas POV, upset, self-aware]

#### Act 1

Dean spends the night at Missouri's place, then bids her goodbye first thing in the morning.

The psychic scrutinizes his face, asking in a caring, motherly voice, "What are you going to do?"

Dean dodges her eyes, hating the pity in them. "What I always do, drive around, look for signs, look for him. I'll come up with something."

"Think you'll be alright?" Missouri opens the front door for him.

"Ain't I always?" Dean manages to put a dangling smile on the lips, leaning in to give her a thankful farewell hug.

He leaves Lawrence, Kansas miles behind by the time the sun rises.

<br>

Life continues more or less the same, roads and bad diner food and cold coffee, nights and dreams and nightmares. Alone, with the Baby being the only company.

Dean crashes for a few hours of sleep once in a while, usually waking with a start, sweat streaming down his spine. He finds it difficult to tell apart the blackness of the night sky from the memory of that splitting dimension he went in during the seance. He would just continue driving, let the cold night wind dry the wetness on his skin and the corners of his eyes. Before long, the night wind is not even that cold anymore, he doesn't notice when spring is already around the corner.

He still runs into cases, now that not only searching for sightings of angels or giant creatures, but also reports of extreme natural disasters and strange behaviors of wild animals. He finds a nest of vampires after reports of unprecedentedly large wild bats, and ghosts of an entire family in a place where locals say the fog is always too thick and too cold. Most of the time, they are just pranks or false reports or actual natural phenomena, he drives to the said locations anyway, just to be sure. He almost gets caught in the middle of twin tornadoes, then a volcanic eruption.

A victim report from Kansas catches his eyes sometime around March, the keywords "blue handprint" and "internal organs liquified" poking at his nerves. His rational mind knows it can't be angels, can't be Cas, if anything. But his brain reads the word "blue" (like Cas's eyes) and "handprint" (like the one burned into his shoulder), and the next thing he knows, he's on US-50 heading west.

Dean drives into the town of Topeka, Kansas two hours later.

The coroner is not the most cooperative person to work with, and getting caught in the middle of the night in the coroner's office rummaging through an empty morgue where the bodies should have been certainly doesn't help his luck.

The djinn blinks her eyes blue as he finds himself tied to a chair, hands bound behind the body. That flash of electric blue is the last thing he sees before sinking into the view of Purgatory.

Dean snaps his eyes open, finding himself napping beside a tree stump. The sky, the ground, the tree, all the same bleak grey he remembers from the real Purgatory. For a moment, his brain tries to figure out which world is the reality, did he dream about getting out of Purgatory and running into the djinn case while he's been here all the time, or did he actually manage to get out and is now dreaming about it again inside the djinn's illusion?

He looks around.

Cas is there, standing by the tree just three steps away from him, in that dirty trench coat over a hospital gown, shoulders hunched. His peachy beard is as messy as Dean remembers.

Dean reaches for him, tentatively, placing a hand on his shoulder. The touch is solid.

Cas turns to him, a soft smile appearing. "Dean," he says, in his usual low gravelly voice, visibly relaxed.

"Cas." Dean finds the word choking. He studies his face. Castiel looks real, grimy and more human than angel, but looking so authentically real, with every little detail perfect. But Dean's gut knows too well it is only because he has every little detail stored in his own memory to manifest it.

He still allows himself to believe it is the real Cas, just for a second. Dean pulls him in, taking a long breath in then letting it out. He pats Cas on the back slightly, before letting him go.

"Are you alright?" Cas looks at him, eyes concerned. A look that would show on real Cas's face so very frequently.

Dean nods. Then, "Are you?"

"Yes, I'm fine," Cas answers, exactly the way Dean knew he would.

But he is not fine. The real Cas is not. Dean remembers that, and he knows every second he spent in this nasty djinn's illusion, is one second closer to his own death, let alone Cas's.

"We have to get out of here," he says automatically, looking for the way to the portal. Cas follows him quietly.

There are monsters and leviathans closing in behind them. There is a large bone blade in his hand.

The monsters seem to keep targeting Cas for attack, showing far more interest in the angel than the human, for some reason. Dean pulls Cas behind him, taking them out one by one, not stopping to question why the change of behavior.

He checks on Cas the moment these monsters are cleared out. "You okay?"

There are more fresh blood stains on Cas's clothes, Dean finds his own brain already starts painting images of deep cuts and wounds underneath the clothes, imagining a lifeless body Cas might turn to if he ever lets his guard slip for a split second. His jaw tightens at the thought, knowing it might be true.

Then Cas says, "I'm fine."

It feels like a conversation they've had a million times. In Purgatory, or in Dean's head.

They reach the portal. And Cas starts to say the usual notions of the portal being human-only and that he should be left behind. And as always, Dean doesn't listen, doesn't even bother arguing. He just holds his hand.

He crosses the portal, and this time, in this vision, Cas is pulled through with him. Right by his side, holding his hand tight.

*Is this how he gets to break the djinn's illusion?* Dean wonders. *Feels too easy.*

The black world waiting on the other side tells the answer otherwise. His eyes blink blankly, trying to understand the view, then gradually, lights and colors and shapes start to show, like a computer screen slowly loading an image.

It is the dimension in between. He realizes. The place that Cas said he is torn and stitched, sliced and spliced, broken apart and fused together, misshaped and reshaped.

Instantly, he looks at Cas.

Cas is still by his side, but his shape is deforming, like a crude animation of a rubber figure being stretched and squeezed, pulled apart.

"Dean." Cas's mouth moves, all the while his head starts to drift away from his body, involuntarily, so do his arms and legs. His body is stretched thin, limbs elongating until they tear from the torso. Wings unfurl from his shoulder blades, only to be ripped away one after another, feathers scattering in a chaotic flurry. His eyes blink in confusion -- not pain, just confusion -- looking at Dean like that's the only thing he can think of doing. Still that deep blue.

"No, no, no, no, Cas! No --" Dean lunges for the fragments, catching a feather or a piece of fabric, but each piece just keeps breaking down, splitting into smaller units right before his eyes. He can do nothing but watch as the horror unfolds, watch as Cas slowly, systematically, disintegrates into a mass of flesh and bon and feathers and fabric floating in space. Then dust. Then atoms.

Never has he ever seen a more terrifying horror movie.

Dean covers his mouth with both hands, choking back the petrified scream rising in his throat. Cold sweat pours down his forehead. His lips and throat are too dry and tight, he can't breathe.

It has been forever since he has to experience a sense of fear like this. The last time was perhaps when Sam took that fresh deep stab to the back and lay lifeless in his arms. The time before was when their Mom burning on the ceiling.

And then, like time rewinding itself, Cas is put back together. Nails returning to fingertips, fingers to hands, hands to arms, arms reattaching to the torso. Some unseen force fits the pieces together like placing puzzle pieces, reconstructing the angel, returning Cas to him. But with things here and there off, features and organs misplaced. His hands are swapped, his legs twisted at odd angles, the left eye sits where the mouth should be, the mouth at the ear's. A figure straight out of a Picasso painting.

Dean gasps in horror. His throat can't squeeze a single syllable of word out, not even it is "Cas" that he wants to say.

"Dean." Even in this forced grotesque form of Frankenstein, Cas manages to call his name, with the same intensity and urgency he always has. The eye in the right place and the eye that is not, both fixate on him, staring straight into him. "You have to let me go."

"No," Dean says, without hesitation. "Never."

"Dean, listen to me." Cas's shape gradually  begins to realign, correcting itself, returning to normal. The familiar look returns, the familiar face fixed, the familiar focused blue eyes locked on Dean's. "This place isn't real, and you know it. I'm not real, but you are. Let me go, that's your only way to wake up, to be safe. Or you will die." His eyes big and sad.

Dean swallows hard, knowing he's right. But, "I can't," he murmurs, and he knows it as a fact. "I don't know how to."

The dimension opens a tear before them.

"Please, let me save you. Cas, I have to." Dean holds out a hand. "I can't lose you like I lost every godforsaken thing I've ever cared about in my life."

His eyes sting, his voice sobbing.

Cas does not take his hand, so Dean drags him over, leading them both out of this creepy nightmarish dimension.

Only to find themselves back in Purgatory. Leviathans lurking. Vampires circling. The portal gleams atop the mountain, shining white light.

It is an infinite loop.

Cas draws his hand back, holding Dean's gaze. Hint of glittering tears at the corners of his eyes. "You have to go without me, Dean."

Dean eyes the monsters around them, looking back at the angel in front of him, voice trembling. "They'll kill you."

"Yes," Cas says, uncaring. "Let them. Or the djinn will kill *you*, Dean. This djinn feeds on fear."

"I'm not afraid of the monsters."

"But you're afraid of losing me." Cas smiles gently, reaching out a hand to stroke his cheek, then lets the hand fall. He says it again, softly but firmly, "Let me go. It's okay. I'll be fine. The real me outside will be fine too."

"God..." Dean wipes his eyes, pulling Cas into a tight hug, exhaling a broken breath against his shoulder, pressing his lips to the side of his disheveled hair.

Then he lets him go.

Dean runs toward the portal alone, not looking back. He hears the growls of the monsters, the sound of teeth tearing into flesh and fabric. He can still feel the weight of a pair of blue, blue eyes on his back, with a small relieved smile. Exactly the look he knows real Cas would have if he were really here.

Dean forces his eyes not to look back, wills his legs not to falter at the horrific sounds, and leaps through the portal.

He wakes up, and he kills the djinns that trapped him.

The corners of his eyes are still wet. He breathes out long and shaky.

The silver blade drops to the floor.

<br>

#### Act 2

Dean stays awake the whole night driving away from Topeka, Kansas, running as far away as possible. But the memory of that messed-up illusion world doesn't take it easy on him for the sake of the distance.

The distortion and deformation of Cas's body, of his wings, haunts in his vision. The stretch of road ahead is barely lit by the car's headlights. In the dark corners just beyond the light, he sees the illusion replaying itself at the periphery of his eyes. One version after another, all variations of Cas's figure show up, always troubled, always torn and broken, always wounded and helpless, standing in the corner of his sight, disappearing the moment he turns his head to look. Cas is never really there. But the figures always are.

He hears Cas's voice too, now that the fake world has just reminded him of that deep grave tone he didn't realize he missed so much. The sound takes root in his brain, speaking at his ear, sometimes from afar, other times as if he's right next to him, sitting at the shotgun, reading a piece of news on some paper, or saying some silly everyday conversation.

Dean has to turn his head to the passenger seat half a dozen times, only to see it empty.

The lack of sleep only makes it worse.

Dean distantly wonders if this is what it felt like, back when Sam or Cas had that craziness tumor in their heads. Seeing and hearing Lucifer has to be worse than seeing and hearing Cas everywhere. He decides, somehow slightly comforted by the thought.

He slams the brakes when he thinks he sees Cas walking along the road, too vivid to ignore, but gone in a blink. He stares out the window for a whole stormy night, because for a blink of time, he swears Cas was standing right there. He crashes the car when he thinks he sees a bloody figure in a trench coat lying unconscious in the middle of the road. But the figure vanishes by the time he climbs out of the car, bleeding. The visions always disappear if he blinks hard enough.

Cas is in the dimension in between, not here. Dean has to remind himself of that, over and over again, when he tosses himself through another sleepless night, or stitches himself up after the crash, or fixes the car. He doesn't know if that brief meeting time in the seance has made everything easier or harder. Now that he knows where Cas is, how horrible that place is, but he still can't find him or get to him, it is not helping anything at all except for crushing his heart, like a bloody hand squeezing it tight before ripping it out from his chest.

The nightmares are getting worse too after that, like a dam in his brain has burst, flooding his mind with imagination he never has and never needs. In the rare times he dozes off, the dreams become increasingly vivid and disturbing. Always with Cas being hurt one way or another, in one place or another. He dreams of wings broken and burned, twisted and torn, feathers dropped and scattered everywhere, his body split into pieces, then put back wrong. But whatever shape he takes, the Cas in his dream still always, always holds that same pair of bright blue eyes, locked on Dean. So he would know, it is Cas that is being deformed in every imaginable way, but whatever the change, it is still him. He is still in that body, able to feel and sense everything. The pain, the brokenness, the disorientation. It only makes the vision a million times worse.

Unnerving. Horrifying. Even for him. Even after everything he's seen in his life.

<br>

Dean goes to a crossroads, and buries a box with his photo in it.

The demon shows up as a young pretty blonde.

Dean glances at her tiredly, eyes rimmed red, the demon blade hanging loosely in his right hand.

"Dean Winchester," the demon looks him up and down, grinning. "It's been a while. Last time you made a deal -- yourself for your little brother, what is it you want this time? Or rather, who is it you want to trade your life for?"

He swallows, hating it being so obvious.

"First thing first, can you reach other dimensions?"

"I might," The demon replies casually.

"This is a yes-or-no question, you son of a bitch. Can you or can you not?" Dean growls.

"And my answer is: I might." The demon doesn't flinch. "Now it's your turn, either you trust me, or you don't."

Dean deflates. "What do you want in return? Ten years?"

"That would be too good to be true, wouldn't it?" The demon smiles a cheap smile, clicking her tongue. "We both know Hell can't hold you, and as soon as your boyfriend is topside, he'd just fetch you out of there anyway."

Dean puffs. "Then what?"

"What about --" The demon makes a thoughtful gesture. "I get him out, then you jump in?"

"What?" Dean glares at her.

"Would be a lot more fun to watch, wouldn't it? Somewhere out of reach. Then we can all sit tight and wait to see how *he* deals with it and tears everything down to get to you, just like you are now."

As disgusting as the demon is, she's right, Dean realizes. He'd just be making Cas feel as awful as he is now. Just like that same sick feeling he got when he found out about Dad's deal with Yellow-Eyes. God knows what Cas would do to handle that kind of misery. The guy blasted open Purgatory once, he might tear the whole multidimension down if that's what it takes to find Dean -- hell, *he* wants to do that too, if only he weren't a powerless human. But Cas, Cas might actually can and he would.

"He'd smite your brain out first thing," Dean says.

The demon smirks. "Worth it. Pity you wouldn't be there to watch it or see how broken he'd be. Or maybe, I'll make sure he hears every bit of detail how you made the deal, just to crush that delicate angel heart. Then kill him permanently while he's grieving."

Dean growls, marching forward with the demon blade raised high. The demon takes a hurried step back, "Easy, tiger, there is still a terrifying little girl in here, you wouldn't hurt her, would you?"

Dean pauses, lowering the blade, but the killing look in his eyes doesn't recede. "I'll just tear your demonic ass from your human ass then."

The words slip out without a second thought, but the moment they reach his ears, they strike him like an awakening drumbeat, so loud that he startles himself and has to steady his step to not stumble.

*Separating the true form from the body.* Didn't Cas say his main problem was his true form being spliced into the body, that it's what made him giant and stuck in that in-between dimension? So what if there is a way to separate them for him, and put them back together right, like rebreaking a malunited bone for it to heal correctly after.

He eyes the demon in front of him, and has a better idea.

<br>

The Gas'n'Sip rings a small bell when the door is pushed open. The store is empty with only a girl in a leather jacket and brunette hair standing at the register, checking out some gum and snacks. She doesn't look up at the newcomer as the cashier hands her the change.

A man approaches her from behind, a blade jabbed against her back, hidden beneath his jacket. His voice low, "We need to talk."

Meg snorts a laugh, not bothering to look back. "Dean. Nice to see you too. Aren't you going to buy me dinner first?"

"Sure, the drink will be holy water." Dean's tone is flat, "Now, walk."

They end up stopping by a deserted factory.

"I gotta ask, Dean, how'd you even find me?" Meg asks, genuinely curious. "Thought I was laying low enough."

"A little bird told me," Dean deadpans.

"You mean you tortured a demon." Meg reads his blank face. "Just to find me? You really know how to flatter a girl."

Dean ignores her. "What do you know about the angel-expelling spell?"

"Angelic exorcism? Why, trouble in paradise?" Meg looks truly intrigued now. "Cas piss you off so bad you're gonna banish him to Heaven? That's surely more fascinating than any Saturday night soap opera."

"Not like that." The thought of Cas leaving for Heaven makes his stomach twist. Dean shifts his feet.

"Care to elaborate?" Meg raises an eyebrow.

"Not your business," Dean bites out. "Now, the spell." He waves the demon blade in a way that makes his point clear.

"Fine," Meg looks away, dropping the smile. "I picked up a thing or two during my time with Yellow-Eyes. Azazel never used it, but Alastair couldn't shut up about it. I wasn't there but I heard he really enjoyed trying the spell on a certain angel when they first walked the Earth after two thousand years, not long before he got burned clean once and for all."

Dean looks at her intensely. "Which angel did he use it on?" The memory of the day Alastair died was still all too clear. That was also the devastating day of knowing he was the one jump started the apocalypse, the day Sam killed the demon with his damn mind.

"Our beloved Castiel, of course," Meg answers lightly.

Dean feels sick. But he remembers Cas was still there, when he woke up from that beating in the hospital. He'd been too caught up in his own thoughts to check him properly, but now that he thinks back, Cas might've looked a little pale but he was okay. At least Cas was still there by his bedside, which means either the spell wasn't finished, or he got banished back to Heaven but came back unharmed.

"Just, tell me the words." He tries hard to push away the image of Alastair putting his dirty demon hand on Cas's throat, chanting the angel exorcism spell. Cas's eyes would probably glow bright and white, his grace would fly skyward until he reaches Heaven, if Heaven'd still take him in. He can't imagine how the first apocalypse would have ended if Cas hadn't been there for him.

"*Omnipotentis Dei potestatem invoco! Ab orbe terra, Hunc angelum omne obsequendum! Domine expuet, Ut Deum ad empyreum remittat!*" Meg recites the Latin verses.

Dean memorizes the whole thing. He tries not to think about the fact he is just about to do the same thing to Cas that Alastair did before.

"Any side effects I need to know about?" Dean asks.

Meg shrugs slightly. "From the spell? No." She pauses there, leaving something unsaid hanging in the air.

"What?" Dean stares at her clear hesitance, demanding.

"But whatever you're about to do, I'm sure it's gonna end ugly," Meg says, not unkindly, just stating the obvious. "That's just how things with you Winchesters always go. You sure you don't want to tell me the whole story? Have you ever considered, *maybe* I can help?"

"What do you care? You are a demon." Dean frowns.

"That hurts my feelings, Dean. In case you haven't noticed, I do care," Meg raises her voice exaggeratedly, "and I've been good to you."

"You've been good to *you*," Dean retorts.

"Wouldn't have done that 'bursting into the Death Star through the front door so you and the angel could find Dick Roman' move if it's just *me* I'm caring, would I?" Meg shoots back. "And don't forget, when I took care of Cas for months when he lost his noodle, where were you?"

Dean swallows uneasily. He meets Meg's eyes, the unsaid obvious thing swirling in there, deep and shiny. Meg raises her eyebrows in challenge.

So he tells her.

Not everything, not much details, but enough for her to get some idea: the Purgatory, the dimension in between, the deformation. "So, all the fun things," she concludes. She's been listening quietly without interruption.

Dean talks more than he can remember he has in months. For a brief moment, it feels good. It feels easy. He even feels... understood, as if of all the people in the whole world, somehow, *Meg* is the one who knows what he's talking about. It surprises him.

He leaves out the parts with the djinns and the nightmares.

Meg bites her lip when Dean stops talking, deep in thought.

Dean watches her face. "Spit it out."

Meg shoots him a look. "Why am I not surprised you managed to break him and lose him *again*? Bravo."

Dean turns, ready to leave. "Okay, that's enough, I don't need anyone making me feel shittier than I already do."

"But I get it." Her voice behind his back says, gentler. "That plan of yours, it might actually work."

Dean spins back. "You think?"

Meg nods, not in any joking tone anymore. "I know. Angels are more like demons than humans in a way, so call me a professional in that. We need to possess bodies to walk the Earth, so do they. But banishing from the body and summoning him back, it's like pulling a heart out of a chest and shoving it back in before it stops beating. You miss the timing, you're stuck with a corpse."

Dean swallows again, forcing a light voice. "Guess I'll just have to time it right then, no problem."

"A million things could go wrong," Meg says, "but I admire you humans' blind hope. There is another catch."

Dean sighs. "Of course there is."

"You'll probably die." Meg tells him, flatly. "And knowing it's you, I wouldn't bother with the 'probably,' you are definitely going to die."

Dean narrows his eyes. "I didn't see that in the fine print of the spell."

"Oh, not the spell. Assuming Cas is saved, blah blah, happy reunion. But you forget about that tear." Meg meets his gaze. "You haven't really thought about how to fix a dimension, have you?"

Dean falls quiet. Then, "What's that gotta do with my death?"

"Everything." Meg takes a breath, as if what she's about to say next is a big thing even for her. "Because death is an infinite vessel."

Dean raises his eyebrows in question.

"From what you said, the tear makes everything on the edge infinite. It touches one snowflake and becomes the biggest snowstorm; touches one bird and becomes countless killer birds --"

"The *Infinity Mirror Effect*," Dean murmurs in realization. "Cas told me about it, but I didn't really understand what that means."

And now he does, loud and clear. An infinite vessel to contain the infinite disasters that fall through, a patch for the tear that keeps dragging Cas away, pulling him back into that painful dark dimension. Death, being the ultimate solution to the rule of physics. Somehow, he can almost see the beauty in it.

The solution to bringing Cas home.

"I'll do it," Dean says, a small smile starting to form on his lips. The first real smile in months, maybe years.

"I know you will." Meg nods once, holds out a hand as if trying to pat him on the shoulder, but pulls it back on second thought before touching.

"Thanks, I guess," she says instead.

Dean doesn't ask what for.

<br>

#### Act 3

Dean goes back to Kermit, Texas.

The weather is warming up everywhere, even more so in Texas. April here is almost like summer in the Midwest.

He hides the car two blocks away, and stands behind a tree across the street. The bushes and lawn inside the fence are tidy, freshly cleaned. The blossoms poking out between the pickets are soft and pink.

The white curtains are drawn. But as he watches, the same woman he saw last time walks slowly to the window, opening the curtain and the window half-wide, stretching lazily. The early sunlight dyes her light brown hair a warm chestnut. Her hand absently rubs her lower stomach.

Dean finds it surprisingly easy to imagine dark brown hair on a future niece or nephew.

He hears Sam's voice before seeing him, the jingle of a dog's neck bell rings cheerfully accompanying his voice.

"Dog, Dog! This way!"

Dean looks up, watching as Sam rounds the corner of the block, in his morning jog clothes, running down the street. A big shepherd dog trots a few steps ahead of him.

They stop in front of the house. The door opens before Sam reaches the top step of the stairs.

"I can hear you from a block away." The woman smiles fondly, leaning on the doorframe. "All the neighbors probably know by now our dog is called 'Dog.'"

Sam laughs, genuinely happy. Even from across the street, even with his back to him, Dean can see his smile. He lights up with his whole body, like a river thawing under the touch of sunshine.

"You want to name him something else?" he hears Sam answer, then sees him reaching out to the woman, holding her waist, pulling her into a hug and a light kiss, as if they haven't seen each other for a year, instead of less than a morning.

The woman wraps her arms around Sam's back, holding him close. Dean can see her hands gripping the back of his flannel, her ring finger reflecting a silvery light. She must have whispered something funny near Sam's ear, Sam barks out louder laughter again. They finally walk into the house after that.

The clean, painted door closes behind them.

Dean stares at the closed door for a moment longer, with a small smile tugging at his lips.

There is a large iron lock on the garage door, in addition to last time. A printout is taped at eye level, too far for Dean to read, but sure enough, there is an image of the Impala.

Dean wonders briefly what Sam did when he found out the Impala was missing. Did he check the security footage and traffic cameras like they would for a case? Or did he just call the police station and post flyers in the neighborhood, like a *normal* person with a lost pet?

He wonders, then decides, it doesn't matter.

Dean looks at the house one last time, pressing his forehead to the tree trunk he hides behind. He whispers a quiet, "Goodbye, Sammy." And walks down the street to where he left the car.

<br>

Battle Creek, Michigan is another quick stop.

Dean knows he shouldn't come here, but he can't help it.

It's just another early morning for another town. Twenty hours and three coffees later, he is outside another white-fence house, peeking from inside the car.

Lisa is bustling around the kitchen; Ben has a plate of pancakes. A decent-looking man sits by the same table, looking at both of them with a genuine smile. Lisa tells him "Take care" three times before the kid waves dramatically and walks down the street. A school bus pulls up at the corner five minutes later and picks him up.

Dean is already on his way to Sioux Falls, South Dakota when the light turns green for that school bus at the next block.

Bobby's place is just as he left it, burnt to the ground. And Jody is busy inside the sheriff's office.

Dean watches her from the car.

No one inside that place notices he has been there.

No one in the world notices he has been anywhere, or he would be gone to nowhere.

But it's okay.

Dean stuffs his hands into his jacket pockets, sniffing quietly. He says to himself, "Okay, I'm ready."

That is when his fingers brush against a piece of paper in the pocket.

He fishes it out. The scrap is torn in a hurry from some old newspaper, with scratchy handwriting along the blank edge reads: "Try Alaska. World's End. Thinnest veil. Go get my unicorn."

Dean huffs a short laugh, remembering Meg's last almost-pat. He mutters, "Son of a bitch," with a small smile.

<br>

There is a certain level of truth to calling Alaska the "World's End."

Dean can see it now as he drives farther north.

For miles after miles, the pines lining the road are the only living things he can see. The sky overhead remains dark for long hours even during the day.

He doesn't stop until he reaches the city named Barrow. Until there is no more road ahead of him. There is only the ocean, the glacier, the Arctic left.

For all his life, for all his driving, Dean never thought there would be a day where there is no more road for him to drive. Where, he would reach the end of the path, the end of the Earth, and the near end of himself. Everything fits together so poetically.

He parks the Impala by the empty road, beneath a pine tree, and gets out of the car.

The sky is night, though his watch says otherwise. The twinkling stars in the black canopy blink brightly, more crowded than anywhere else he's seen.

Dean stands on the road, looking up, eyes closed, lips quivering. *Cas.*

The air is chilly, as cold as Alaska is supposed to be, but not any colder. His breath forms thin white fog. The surrounding is quiet, so quiet that he can hear nothing but his own heartbeat pounding heavily in his chest. *Cas.*

He reaches into the innermost chest pocket. The cloth and feather are still there. He holds them, as if the mere touch of them can give him the strength and hope that is losing fast. *Cas.*

There is a pistol on the right side of his belt, and the demon blade on the left. *Death is the infinite vessel.* Dean finds himself wondering, which would be the easier way to go.

There is a whizzing sound rising on the horizon, moving swiftly through the sky. The sound is no louder than the crackle of static electrical sparks on clothes in dry autumn days.

Dean opens his eyes.

There in the sky, astonishing colors and lights are forming and shifting. Bright and abundant in color, the lights are like moving clouds, flicking across the dark curtain of the sky. In fact, the lights are like curtains themselves. Dazzling green lights stretch into vertical lines, as low as the ground, as high as outer space. The green curtain sweeps across the sky, leaving a lighter amber-green trail in its wake.

Dean has never seen the aurora borealis before. He stares, transfixed by the breathtaking scene on the sky without blinking, wondering if it's something natural or there is a tear somewhere nearby. Wondering, if Cas is going to show up any time under this astonishingly beautiful sky.

The crackling sound grows louder, more like the snapping of a fire burning in the hearth now. And the bright aurora lights shift faster, moving across the sky as though alive. The vertical curtain of lights extends farther and longer, then twists into shorter curves and circles, sliding away like snakes wriggling. The green deepens, shifting from the color of mint to lime and emerald.

Dean hovers his hand over the weapons on his belt, fingers edging on the handles but not closing on them. Waiting. He watches the vast sky, feeling small again. The infinity of color and light.

More colors emerge, soon. There is so much more than green. The globe of the sky transforms into an immense palette of color and light; the electrical sound fills the air, buzzing with electricity power as the moving lights intensify. Red aurora lights start to show on top of the other colors, floating and shimmering, closely followed by a share of dazzling blue. Like flowing fire sweeping across the vault of sky.

Dean doesn't realize his cheek is wet until a tear drops from his jaw. The grandeur takes his breath away. The thought and prayer finally crawl their way out of his throat. The silent plea becomes a low murmur, and Dean is saying: "Cas. Please. Come to me."

The crackling in the air turns into louder sputtering, as if every particle in the air has been charged with electricity, and every movement of wind sends a current through it. Dean feels his skin prickle with the static. He wonders how long it would take, for all the air from earth to sky to be so charged, that the smallest motion could turn a friction into a spark, just like in a gas station but millions of times stronger, and the air and sky would turn into a literal sea of flame, devouring any men in between.

But he can fix this. Fix the world. Save Cas. His mission, his only job.

Dean wraps the fingers around the demon blade, raising it in front of him. The tip close to the chest, not touching yet.

The air before him shudders violently. Dean holds his breath, watching it tear open from the other side, becoming a large black scar hanging vertically in midair.

A figure manifests slowly from the tear. The disheveled hair is the first to emerge, showing up at a thousand feet height on the top. Followed closely by a towering giant human-shaped body, cloaked in an enormous trench coat, standing steadily on the ground. Behind the body stretch three pairs of colossal wings, spread high and wide, leaving long dark shadows beneath the bright aurora lights, holding very still. And above it all, the strangest thing ever, Dean finds himself being watched by countless eyes all at once, spread on three gigantic spinning rings.

Dean forgets how to breathe.

<br>

#### draft notes

(tears are form when Dean yearns the most desperately -> first two cases are both when he's dying, third one is just because he's so lonely and missing Cas so much it's also killing him, the danger comes from his suicidal/self-sacrifice thoughts, very dedicated to die)

why Alaska: world's end, veil thinnest (Meg: "Try Ushuaia or Norway if you want, but figured Alaska would be the closest to you")

### Chap. 5 Through Your Eyes (I see you)

> **Outline:** Dean see Cas's full size true form+body, shocked/terrified/in awe.

#### Act 1

All the eyes on all the rings blink at the same time. So does the one on the giant human-shaped body, shining white light from its pupils.

Dean is shaken out of his freeze by the piercing lines of sight coming from all directions. His breath hitches, his knees give way. His body can't hold still, he takes a step back in shock.

He looks up, neck sore from the crooked angle. He stares into the pair of eyes on Cas's face. The light is too dazzling and bright to see, it makes his eyes hurt, but he holds the gaze. The color and light of the aurora borealis that had seemed so astonishing, pales behind Cas in comparison.

The eyes of Castiel's true form follow Dean's movement. As he takes the step back, they shift to follow him, then blink slowly. Cas lifts a foot and mirrors his motion, taking a slow step back just like Dean did. A step closer to the tear in the air.

"No!" Dean finds his voice again, shaky and broken, but it comes out like a scream. Panic rises. His legs are heavy like lead, but he forces them to move, dragging one up and throwing the other back down. He stumbles toward the misshaped form of Castiel.

Castiel stops where he stands. The spinning of the rings slows. Still all-eyes staring.

Dean swallows under the weight of the eyes. Too many, too odd-shaped, too out of place, too un-human. Alien and strange. He bites the inside of his cheek, blinks hard to chase away the crawling unease, to sooth the creeping goosebumps. He has to remind his own brain to bear the eyes without flinch, to press down the instinct of running away. *This is Cas. Cas is not weird. Cas is not dangerous. This is Cas.* He forces his steps forward, toward where Cas stands. His legs are still feeble from the shock.

"You are, afraid of me." Castiel says, slowly, testing the sound and volume. It is still so much louder than a human voice, but not as deafening as the angel's true voice. And it is a statement, an observation, not a question.

"No!" Dean is still shaky, each step wobbly, but he almost reaches right in front of Cas now, right at his feet. And he realizes, the distance has made the size and shape deceivable, the perception skewed even if just for several feet. Now that he can almost touches this form of Cas's, Dean finds out, even if he reaches as tall as he can, he could barely touch anywhere above the heel of Cas's shoes. He stands there, looking up, wondering if it's how ant's view of a human would be like. He remembers looking up at the Statue of Liberty from its base, that one time they visited New York when he was young.

"Yes," Dean hesitates, allowing himself to admit, feeling the aftershock still hanging around his limbs. He answers carefully, voice tight, full of awe. "But not the way you think."

"Tell me," Cas says, in a pained voice, the light in his eyes dimming. The voice that says without saying: *Tell me how horrifying and dangerous I am now, tell me how distorted and undignified this shape is. Tell me I am a monster. Tell me your disgust and terror, your hatred and unforgiveness, and that you'll leave me between the dimensions as I was. The place I deserved to be.*

And Dean tells him, through a choked sound, "It's beautiful, Cas. You're beautiful. Awesome, really. In any form, in all the forms." He pauses, letting the words sink in, because it's the truth. In the place where his stomach twists with unease, there are also flutters. Then, the bigger truth: "I'm not afraid of you, Cas. I never will be. I'm afraid of losing you."

The lingering touch of the Cas in the djinn's version of Purgatory comes back to him. So do those wide blue eyes filled with the glistening tears when he said, "You have to let me go." Dean can't help wiping his face with his hand, finding the barely dried places wet again. It feels so easy to admit it, to say it now, as if he has practiced it a thousand times -- with the djinn world and his nightmares being rehearsals, that might as well be true.

And just like the nightmare replay, Cas sighs heavily, and then says, "But you have to let me go. Me being here, my existence and the tear, it's breaking the dimension, it might break the sky and the whole world. I don't want to hurt you. I would never hurt you."

He glances at the sky. The lights of the aurora borealis intensify into more powerful glaring lights. The sky is almost bright now, not like daylight, but with the flowing curtains of aurora, mixed from green, blue, and red. The colors shift rapidly and violently, the whole sky is like a boiling cauldron with a swirling mix of mysterious colors from witch's potions.

"I know, Cas, I know!" Dean yells at the top of his volume. "But I have a way."

<br>

"No, this is too dangerous." Cas snaps, once Dean finishes telling him the plan, the part about expelling him then quickly summoning him back.

"I know, I'll have to time it right or you'll be... hurt, but I'll keep both hands on the wheel, alright? Just have some faith in me, I'll do it right." Dean says. He knows "hurt" is too mild a word, but he tries not to think about what if he messes it all up and ends up making everything even worse than it is. He can't think about that now.

"I always have faith in you, Dean. But no, I mean dangerous to you," Cas clarifies in eagerness, "I don't care what happens to me, but you, Dean, you'll be in danger."

Dean blinks, then he looks up at the sky and remembers. The dazzling light and the electric-charged air. The infinity that leaks from the tear and endangers the reality. The rule of dimension and the laws of physics that could kill him as easily as a snap.

"I won't be able to protect you during that process," Cas finishes, in a voice that is quieter but no less firm.

"What about, for once, make it my turn to protect you?" Dean says, just as quiet, just as insistent and stubborn.

Cas falls silent. He bends the body, lowering a hand, making an attempt as if he wants to reach a finger to touch Dean, but then remembers his size. Even his smallest finger is larger than Dean's whole body, so the movement is paused in the middle.

He sighs again.

"What about the tear?" Cas asks, pulling his hand back to his side where it belongs. "Even if you can separate my form and fix me, there is still the tear of the dimension that needs fixing."

Dean shifts uneasily. "We'll handle that later." His grip on the demon blade tightens automatically, hidden behind his back.

The eyes on Castiel's rings scrutinize him closely from all angles. Dean has the weird feeling of being observed and researched under a microscope, that even his smallest movement won't escape these many eyes. The feeling of being seen through all the way straight to his soul, his mind. His heart sinks, knowing exactly what Cas would say if he knew the whole picture of his plan.

And Cas starts, "The divide between dimensions is the thinnest when you pray the hardest. And every time you're dying, your feelings and thoughts are so strong they tear the dimensions apart, that's how I get through."

Dean opens his mouth, trying to object. But Cas doesn't let him.

"That's why I reached to you in the snowstorm on Rocky Mountain, why I found you in the redwoods of California. You were dying, both times, then."

There is a pause. A question hanging on Cas's lips. Dean realizes, Cas doesn't want to ask as much as Dean doesn't want to answer.

He is not dying this time. Not immediately from any source of danger in the outside world anyway. But from... His fingers twitch around the blade's handle. The carving patterns on the handle are getting imprinted into his palm by being gripped too tightly.

"Are you planning to sacrifice yourself to save me, Dean?" Cas asks, at long last.

Dean finds his chest too clenched to answer. He can't bring himself to tell the truth, but he can't lie to him, either. So he just stills, desperate for an answer that doesn't exist.

But the silence is the answer of its own.

Cas probably doesn't even need that confirmation to know. "I won't let you die," He tells him, as a statement of fact. "Not for me. Not again."

"But I have to," Dean blurts out, desperate. That's the only thing he can think to say. "I have to."

*That's his job. No, not because that's his job.* Dean frantically corrects his own mind. *That's because it's Cas.* He doesn't need another reason.

"Why? I don't deserve it," Cas says, voice sad and tired, more tired than Dean's ever seen him. "What's the point of living if I can't fix the things I broke?" What "the things" are, he doesn't say. He doesn't need to. The world that is torn, the lives that are lost, some heart that is broken, some trust that is lost, some bond that is always, forever, it seems, fractured.

Cas begins to step back again, the edges of the tear of the dimension starts brightening up. His steps don't seem voluntary, it's more like he's being absorbed backward by a vortex than walking on his own, and he is too tired to resist. His wings hang low, exhausted and heavy.

"This way, at least I can close the tear, using my own body. A fitting punishment and redemption." Cas is yards away from Dean now, and no more than one step away from the tear. "Just, take care of yourself, Dean."

It's a debate neither of them can win or ever convince the other. Isn't it always the ultimate Winchester debate in the face of every single godforsaken world-ending event? Dean knows it far too well by now, so he doesn't bother with it anymore.

"Cas." He calls the angel, holding the stare one last time, as determined as he can be. The decision is already made.

"*Omnipotentis Dei potestatem invoco! Ab orbe terra...*" Dean starts, just as Castiel is about to take that final step.

<br>

#### Act 2

Lights brighten in Castiel's eyes immediately in Dean's chanting, then in his mouth. Then in every single eye spread across the three spinning rings.

The lights are so blinding that the sun would be ashamed of its dimness in comparison. Dean doesn't want to close his eyes, not this time. *If it burns, then let it burn,* he decides.

He keeps looking at Castiel, at his body that is too enormous, at his face too high above in mid-air, at the wings spread wide and casting long shadows, at the rings spinning like stars in orbit and reflecting silvery. Dean looks at Castiel as he is, in all the forms that he is, as a whole. He takes everything that is Castiel all in as if those are going to be the last things his eyes might ever see again -- which could very well be true. He needs to see him to time the next part right. But more importantly, he needs to see him.

The lights begin to cover the wings, then the rings shimmer just as brightly, as if these angelic parts all start melting together into grace.

Slowly and steadily, Castiel's grace is expelled from his body by the incantation, as the spell works its magic. The flowing lights shift through the air, swirling as if they have lives of their own, twisting and floating, like solar winds flowing in space, like the dazzling shape of aurora lights undulating on the firmament. They circle around Cas's body, hesitant to leave. Then they begin rising, moving skyward, toward Heaven.

Dean is already moving toward the Impala as he chants the angel exorcism, by the time the last thread of Cas's grace leaves his body, he already has the car trunk wide open, and the bowl with the mixture of ingredients for the angel summoning spell setting on the drawing is long pre-prepared and ready to go. He throws a lit match into the bowl, watching the flames leap high from the mix of herbs.

Outside, Cas's grace begins to move back, descending from the sky, as the ritual takes effect.

Dean holds his breath and waits. A part of his brain never stops wandering off, panicking about what if the summoning doesn't work and Cas's grace ends up at the Heaven's gates, where other angels spot him and kill him again. He doesn't realize he starts praying again, just repeatedly thinking, *Please, Cas. Please, work. Please, come back.*

As Cas's grace flies away and then hovers back, his body collapses like a falling mountain. Without the control of a living mind, the body drops, the legs slump, the arms limp, the shoulders crash. The ground shakes like an earthquake. The sound of mountains moving, oceans churning, volcanos erupting.

Dean is startled, he is petrified. He only belatedly realizes he forgot to consider how to prevent this giant body from crashing to the ground hard, from being harmed by the impact of the collision. Though, given his own tiny size, he doubts there is anything he could have done. He hates the thought that Cas's body might be injured in the process by the slightest because of his oversight. *Please.* He can only hope.

The only fortunate thing is that this is Alaska. For miles, there are no human sightings. No one to witness anything, no collateral damage.

Dean runs toward where the giant body lies. Where the Chrysler Tower has fallen to the earth. The site of the landfall and avalanche of one single celestial being, of Castiel.

There is something else he realizes not working as he thought should be. The body is still too big -- as it was. Somehow in his mind, in his plan, he imagined it would shrink back to the normal size the moment the angelic parts were separated, somehow things would correct themselves and problems would get solved automatically -- they never do.

And now, with the grace hovering over the lifeless body that is still too giant, the problem remains.

Dean forces himself to think fast. He looks at the cloud of light, as if looking into Cas's eyes. He can feel his own brain overheating from thinking too hard, dizzy from the brilliance, too sluggish to keep up with reality.

"Okay, umm, okay, we just need to, ugh --" Dean puts a hand on the edge of the giant trench coat that now spread across the ground. And as far as he reaches, he can only lay a palm on the corner, no farther than the first stitched edge. *He's too tiny, too weak, too helpless.* The shape and scale keep reminding him. *He's just a human. How could he ever imagine fixing an angel that is so grand and beautiful?*

Dean clenches his fingers around that corner of the fabric he can get, forcing his mind away from that train of thought. *This is about Cas, not about him.*

The lights float closer to him than to the body on the ground, but still high in the air, out of reach.

Dean feels like he can almost imagine Castiel's frown and tilted head in the way the grace hovers around him. Paused, pending, nowhere to go. Homeless. Bodyless.

"We need to get you a body first."

The thought comes in a flash, so does the answer. This is actually an obvious answer. An easy one, too easy. A permission freely given.

"Yes," Dean says quickly, eyes seeking the light of Cas's grace. "Cas, I said yes."

The grace floats toward him, circling around his body, inches away, but doesn't move into him like he expects it to be. It's almost like Cas is considering, hesitating, resisting.

"You'll never hurt me, I promise," Dean looks at the grace, knowing what he must be thinking. "I trust you." He reaches out a hand, and touches the grace, finding it warm and soft, like the brush of a feather.

The light reacts to his touch instantly, curling around his fingers, then gliding along his skin up the arm until it reaches his mouth. It swarms into him.

The sensation of being possessed isn't exactly welcoming. It feels like an intrusion no matter what, a forest fire burning its way down his throat, an explosion of light and thunder ripping through his veins, lava pouring and spreading through his chest. His body panics automatically, muscles tense. His body tries to reject the outsider even if his brain commands otherwise. Dean forces his mind to focus on the only thought he can hold on to: *This is Cas. This is Cas. This is Cas.* And his heartbeat slowly calms.

The view of the world flares bright once all the grace infuses into him, it's like setting the brightness and contrast level on a TV screen to a thousand and more. Everything so dazzling and blinding, covered by glinting stars, Dean thinks his eyes might burn out from looking at the world like this even a minute longer, but then realizes the eyes are perfectly adapted to it -- the eyes that are not entirely his own right now. *Is this the view of the world in Cas's eyes?*

"Cas?" Dean's mouth whispers, tentatively, toward the empty road ahead of him. Cas's body is still slack on the ground, but that's not what he means.

Inside him, the stir of another presence emerges. Dean closes his eyes, searching inward.

At the edge of his mind, he finds him. Cas looks exactly the same as he remembers him, the trench coat, the blue tie, the disheveled hair, the bright blue eyes. No rings though, and no wings. Human-like. Familiar. Comfortable and easy to look at.

Cas stands there, still and quiet, in the corner of Dean's mind, as if trying to take up as little space as possible, like a shy kid hiding at the back of the prom, trying to make himself unnoticeable.

This corner of Dean's mind looks like Bobby's old living room back when it was still standing. The place closest to home. And Cas is here.

Dean rushes to him. "There you are."

For all his concerns, Cas looks well. In this current form as he is -- whatever it's called when he is just a cloud of light inside Dean's mind. He looks a little tired, and a little -- no, a lot -- worried, with the deep furrow between his brows. But all things considered, he looks fine. No wounds, no scars, no cuts, no twisting or distortion. Not like in any of the dreams or nightmares Dean has been having. He looks okay, and normal. And utterly human.

Dean spreads his arms and pulls Cas into a hug. His brain produces the sensation of warmth and solidity of a body for him, even though he knows nothing is physical now.

Cas reluctantly lifts his arms and wraps them around Dean. The motion alien and hesitant like he's not used to having arms again. Then he doesn't let go. Neither does Dean.

"Hello, Dean," He says, in his gravelly voice.

Dean exhales a happy huff, realizing he can't even begin to tell him how much he's missed this voice, among everything else.

"Hey, Cas," He replies, over his shoulder.

They separate, after a long, long time, each taking half a step back, still standing too close, eyes still holding. In this corner of Dean's mind, in this memory or dream or whatever it is, sunshine filters through the window, casting long lazy shadows across the soft fuzzy carpet of the living room floor. Dean can almost pretend it's just a comfortable quiet afternoon on a lazy normal day. Everything warm and hazy. They could curl up on the couch and watch TV for hours, take a small nap if they doze off. And Bobby or Sam would call them for dinner.

Dean smiles.

But Cas's frown does not unwind.

"You shouldn't have done this," Cas says, his eyes close to reproachful, but it really just is all condensed concern. And Dean knows.

"Yeah, heard that before, kinda have a name for terrible at doing what I should do by now, ain't I?" Dean grins. The kind of grin that makes a shallow dimple appear on his cheek.

Cas sighs, and says, quietly, wholeheartedly. "Thank you."

Dean answers with a nod and a smile. "Don't mention it."

He pats Cas on the shoulder. The touch is still warm and solid. Real.

<br>

#### Act 3

Dean opens his eyes again. He is still alone on the cold roadside of Alaska, at the World's End, with no more road to go and a large clump of lifeless figure collapsed in front of him on the ground. But for once, he feels good. For once, he is not really alone -- maybe he never was.

The sensation of Cas's presence tugs gently in his mind. Dean tucks him in, feeling oddly like hens tucking chickens beneath their wings. All the while the angel's body remains an enormous hill in front of him. Dean laughs at the humor of the scene. He hears Cas mumbles a small note of unhappiness at the back of his head.

Dean has to restrain his smile a little. "Sorry buddy, no, not laughing at the body, I swear." He reassures the angel. "Just thinking how extremely like a black satire movie this is. Would make a masterpiece as art, instead of, you know, as life."

Cas chuckles softly.

Dean is getting better used to the overly brightened view now. He widens his eyes in curiosity. The view of the world is so abundant with light and color, casting clarity that he has never known. And he realizes the glinting stars constantly shining in his vision aren't really stars, that's air, for what air really is. The air is not transparent emptiness, instead, the tiniest particles charged with electricity shooting through space, bumping and colliding, transferring power and energy. That must be where all the low buzzing and humming come from, and the faint electric prickle on the skin as if brushing against a low-voltage power line.

"The entire Earth's electromagnetic field is being affected by the tear this time," Cas explains from the backseat of his mind, deeply worried. "Because of the infinite plasma. The aurora borealis is only the first phenomenon. Soon, Earth will draw the Moon and itself off orbit, then disrupt solar activity so much to the point the whole solar system could collapse off balance, we don't have long."

Dean looks up at the sky. It looks nothing like what his human eyes witnessed before. Well, in a way, it might still be the same scene, the mixed dazzling colors, shapes that are like flowing curtains and snakes and flames sweeping across the sky. Except now, there are so much more details filling in the blanks.

Now he sees more than light, more than color, more than sky. He sees the world as it is, he sees plasma punching through the ionosphere, he sees electrons leaping in and out of excited atoms, he sees oxygens glowing red and nitrogen beaming green, there is even infrared and ultraviolet that he's sure beyond human eye perception. The particles dance in the sky, painting fascinating patterns like tails of dragons, wings of phoenixes, eyes of thunderbirds. The palette of the universe, so big and so small at the same time. A world that no human eyes were meant to witness, and now he is bathed in its beauty and magnificence. Because he has an angel inside him. He is not watching with eyes alone.

He doesn't realize tears are streaming down his face until he hears Cas's low soothing voice: "I'm sorry, Dean. Is it too much? I can restrain the vision, and the other sensations..."

There is also sound and scent and touch. He doesn't even have enough attention or time for those yet. All the new sensations for the world. It's almost like being reborn.

"No, no," Dean mutters, out of breath, wiping away his tears in a hurry. Tears that are not coming from sorrow, or grief, or worry, or joy, or any emotion really. It's the body reacting to the view, being taken by the grandiosity, overwhelmed by the shared sensation with an angel.

The magic of the moment is broken by the movement. He forces himself to tear his eyes away from the sky, feeling that sinking ache of knowing he may never see anything like this again in his life, not after Cas leaves him. He wants to remember this, but he has work to do. Is this what Cas meant when he said he could only taste molecules when he tried food? Because to an angel's eyes and senses, the whole world is too generously and selfishly only showing its fundamentals all the time, only particles. The view, the sound, the taste, the scent, the touch. Everything as it fundamentally is, stripped down to its smallest components. The smallest, and sometimes the largest. Knowing too much, and sometimes feeling too little.

And he hears Cas answering, quietly, a little sad. "Yes. Sometimes."

Though Dean didn't really ask the question. He doesn't have to.

<br>

He sees the world as it is.

Then he sees Cas as he is.

And he sees himself as he is.

Dean's eyes land on Cas's body next. The giant form dressed in a skyscraper-sized trench coat and clothes that is most human yet furthest from human. The body looks slimmer without the wings, but it's still a mountainous presence.

*The vessel is made of atoms and electrons in the material plane.* Dean remembers Cas's words again, the theory Cas once tried to explain to him but he had to cut him off because he couldn't understand. And this time, now, he doesn't just understand, he sees it now.

The hand of the vessel lies limp at its side, stretched loosely on the middle of the road, fingers curved, as tall as houses. Dean walks toward them. It takes a few minutes.

Everything is in so much details. Every grain of skin, every line of the palm, every hair and scar, every dip and wrinkle. He sees the hand, then he sees flesh and blood and bone beneath the skin, at last he sees the atoms and molecules forming every cell, vibrating and humming with energy as all particles do.

Dean presses his own palm against the edge of this giant hand of Cas's body, it feels like touching a wall of flesh, bizarre and unsettling. But they touch. And he finds them the same. The same particles that form everything in this universe, in all the bodies, in Dean's body and Cas's vessel, in flesh and blood, in planets and dust. Things that are as old as stars, and as young as newborns. In the material plane, they are the same. But Castiel is not.

Cas is not physical, not really. Cas does not come from this dimension, but he chooses to be here, he comes here. He resides in a body, and he walks the Earth. And now, he is inside Dean. He drops the grand form, and he curls his entire multidimensional wavelength into that small corner of Dean's mind. And he doesn't complain about claustrophobia. He stands there, and he says, "Dean." As if all that he wants to say can be condensed into one word. As if this place, of all, is the only place he'd rather be.

For the first time, Dean thinks, maybe this is for the first time, he finally starts to have a glimpse of understanding what it means to be an angel. A real angel, in all their forms, from their perspective. Not just the vessel, not just a thread of light, not just a part of the whole. Not just, a fragment of trench coat, a scrap of tie fabric, a flying feather, a floating eye, or a silvery slice of ring -- the pieces he saw in the in-between dimension, the pieces giving him nightmares nights after nights. Oddly, Dean finds himself feeling a tiny bit of appreciation for what that place showed him. As many nightmares as it gave him, he finally gets to understand, Cas is magnificent and giant and beautiful, beyond his imagination. For the first time, for real.

Dean clenches his fingers, putting his weight on the hands, holding himself there. At that moment, he wants nothing more than to really hold that hand, to hold Cas. So he turns back to inside his head.

Cas meets him in the mental manifestation of Bobby's place. The sunlight seeping through the window doesn't shift, time doesn't move here. Still the same nice lazy afternoon. The bright sunlight shines on half of Cas's figure, dyeing his black hair a golden brown.

And Dean reaches for his hands, squeezing them, looking him in the eyes. Those big blue, ocean-deep, glacier-old, universe-witnessing, dimension-traveling eyes. And Dean whispers, "God, you really are an Angel."

It has been almost five years since Cas charged into that barn and declared, "I'm an Angel of the Lord."

Dean stutters, thinking back on all that he saw, not just tonight, not just the past months after Purgatory. "Everything... is, is beautiful, and awesome, and... Jesus, I wish I knew more words."

Cas smiles at him, a gentle and small smile. He nods slightly. His eyes shine.

He understands.

Dean swallows hard, "Never, ever, say you don't deserve."

And that smile drops.

<br>

#### Act 4

Along with it, the sunshine loses its color and warmth.

"Dean," Cas lowers his eyes. "I really don't --"

Dean shushes him with a finger on his lips. "You can argue all you want later, Cas, but we'll patch you up first, alright? Before anything else, let's fix your body first."

"But that wouldn't be necessary if I need to go back to the dimension in between again," Cas points out.

"*Need to?* You don't fucking *need to* go back to that horrible place, Cas!" Dean snaps. "You can just stay here!"

"But that's my responsibility!" Cas snaps back.

"And my responsibility is to keep you alive!" Dean raises his voice.

"And mine is not?" Cas raises his.

They stare at each other, nose to nose, inches apart, falling into sudden silence.

For both of them, one of their hands is clenched into a fist in exhaustion, the other... Dean realizes in a sudden fascination that he's still holding Cas's hand. And Cas seems to realize it at the same moment. He makes a small attempt to pull away, but Dean doesn't let go. So Cas gives up trying.

Dean has a vague gut-deep feeling as if the moment he lets the hand slip, Cas will be gone again. Just like the millions of times in memory replays and nightmare hauntings, the moment the palms slip and the weight lightens, Castiel would disappear. It happened in Purgatory, and it feels like it had happened and will happen for so many more times. Dean just can't take any more.

His voice is hoarse. Cas decidedly keeps his eyes on their hands now, not meeting his gaze.

Dean asks him, gentle this time, "I'll only ask this one thing, then, just this one time. But I want you to be absolutely honest with me, honest with yourself, alright, Cas? If you say no, then I'll stop arguing."

He pauses there for a moment, and Cas nods. His eyes drop even lower than where they focused on to. As if the bottom of the sea suddenly sinks, even lower than the Mariana Trench, and the color of all the oceans deepens so many shades that it shows in Castiel's eyes.

And Dean asks him: "Do you *want* to come back? To Earth?" He hesitates for a second, then adds, quieter, "To me?"

*If we can forget what we need to do, forget everything the world and fate and destiny ask, if we can just live for our own lives and forget about all the consequences, if I choose to stay, will you choose to stay too? Will you come back, to where I am?*

Dean breathes shallowly. He almost forgets to breathe. He doesn't know whether to keep his eyes on Cas's lowered eyes where he can only see the flickering eyelashes, or on their joined fingers. He squeezes the fingers slightly. *Please, be honest. Please, come to me.*

And Cas looks up. He says, agonizingly, "Yes. More than anything. But --"

Dean is already saying, "It's settled, then. Let's patch you up." With a sudden blossomed smile. His breathing evens out smoothly now.

Cas squeezes his fingers back.

<br>

Dean lays his hands -- the real hands in the real world now -- on the edge of Cas's giant vessel's hand. Palm to palm, in the best sense he can manage.

"Okay, Cas, you're up, do you magic," Dean says cheerfully to the air, directing the words toward the back corner of his mind.

Cas sits down on Bobby's sofa in Dean's mind. "I know you'd hate losing control," he says. "You can be the driver. I'll be the fuel."

Dean blinks. "Didn't know that was on the menu."

"Imagine you're an angel," says Cas, *imagine you're me*. "The grace is all at your disposal." *All of me is at your disposal.*

Dean swears he hears the double take of the words Cas just said. *Guess now that we're sharing a brain room, there is nowhere to hide thoughts then.* Dean muses.

Which just gets confirmed by Cas's quiet thought: *Yes*.

They don't even need to talk now. Just the exchange of thoughts would do the talking. Almost like... two-way prayer, minus the praying. Something like a real soul phone this time.

Dean tries to imagine how it's like to really *be* an angel, as giant and bright as he can imagine, channeling the grace into his hand. It isn't easy in the first try, the mortal feeling is still too strong, his feet too stuck to the ground he can't fly. Then, the lighter feeling comes in. He remembers the flying particles in the air and the shifting plasma that creates the colors and lights of the aurora, the vision of color and light. He imagines being an angel -- being Cas -- walking the Earth, seeing the greatest and smallest things, carving the Grand Canyon, building a galaxy, witnessing the universe from its birth to its doom.

He imagines three pairs of wings spreading from his back from the shoulder blades, he imagines looking down at the earth as if he's flying, or his eyes are a thousand feet high, and he has thousands of them. He imagines white-blue light pouring from his eyes. For a moment, Dean feels so disoriented at the imagination he wonders if it's still his own mind imagining, or it's Cas's memories seeping in.

Golden lights flow out from Dean's palms, sinking into the giant body. The centers of his palms grow warm. The air around the glowing light seems to boil, like the shimmering air over burning asphalt on a hot summer day, melting and warping, making the distant view ripple. Or like the air above a burning pyre.

The heated air around the body changes the form and shape of the flesh, just like the vision of stretched roads shift through the waves of heated air. Shortly, Dean finds it difficult to tell if it's because the air deceives the vision, or the actual physical shape of Cas's body is being transformed. Some distant part of his body seems to be sizing down, but Dean can't really tell for sure. There are more lights gathering.

He continues to try anyway, focusing on the thought that he's fixing Cas's body, using the grace inside him that feels almost like part of him now. Dean still finds the idea too unearthly, he would rather it were like fixing the Impala's engine, where he can lift the hood, disconnect and reconnect pipes, find the broken parts, and fix them with wrenches and screwdrivers. It's easy.

He is good at fixing things, he has always been. And the process of seeing something recover from broken, it calms him. *He's not the one who breaks things, he's the one who fixes them,* Dean thinks. He just wishes he were as good at fixing everything else, beyond the Impala.

His mind wanders back to the time when he had to watch Sam hurt really badly by the hallucinations of Lucifer, then Cas hurt as badly after taking over the brokenness. Though Dean never really knew what happened in their heads back then. Something thousands of times worse than he could imagine, he can only presume.

The view is even more wobbly now, the air fills with more sparkling lights of small flying particles, brighter than what he'd just started to get used to. The vision feels like plain human sight overlaid with a layer of celestial special effect on top, then another brighter layer, covering the reality. He can barely make out the giant body in front of him clearly now. He finds his own attention slipping.

Dean blinks. The view changes completely.

### Chap. 6 Inside My Mind (Ritual+reunion)

> **Outline:** Dean actually start rituals: angel exorcism to banish (S04E10/16 Alastair's expel spell; separate true form with vessel), immediately summon him back (S06E21 angel summoning spell; avoid true form going into heaven), use holy fire to bound (avoid leaving); let Cas possess him as vessel temporarily, use his own power fix his vessel's size, jump back into his body.
>
> Dean insists trying, ritual works, Cas shares Dean's body but both awake, Cas use mojo to fix vessel (Dean witnesses, amazed, "so this is how it's like, internally" "that sounds so wrong but whatever") and ready to go back into it (Cas all the time quiet), Dean mentally apologize and tell him his true form is awesome before Cas goes back (talk in Dean's brain, both normal: "You really think that?" "Yeah, I do"). Cas leaves Dean's body, own body remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, problem solved, "Welcome back."
>
> use half Dean's soul+half Cas's grace to fix the tear, so Dean won't die & Cas's won't be gone/fall (or sacrifice a Meg? or use love to solve it?)
>
> *"Death is an infinite vessel, so is love."*

#### Act 1 (Cas memory)

A sudden chilly air blows against his body, Dean shivers at the drop in temperature. It is different from the icy wind in Alaska though, more like... Dean glances around on instinct, and spots an open window with a thin fluttering curtain. He looks around, bewildered. The view seems somewhat familiar, but he can't quite place it immediately.

The walls are white, as is the small single bed in the center of the room, with protective bars on all four sides. It's an infirmary bed. He's in a hospital, of some sort.

Dean looks down at himself, and freezes. He's in hospital clothing, soft white shirt and pants. The same hospital garb he saw Cas in near the end of last year on Earth, and the whole time in Purgatory. Dean has to drape the trench coat over him to smother the sick feeling rising at the sight and the reminder of the meaning of that hospital dressing. But he still sees it all the time anyway. His right wrist bears a blue paper band.

"Cas?" Dean frowns hard at the hand in his view -- the hand that undoubtedly belongs to Cas, and whispers. "Is this... your memory?"

Cas's voice passes into his mind slowly, surprised as well, a soft "Oh," followed by, "I think it might be because of my grace. Some memories are too deeply entangled with the grace, when you channel it, they pass through your soul. The process may affect your perceptions, as if seeing through my eyes."

He pauses, hesitating.

*There are some things he doesn't want me to see.* Dean thinks, feeling the edge of some emotion start to crawl up.

"No, Dean, not hiding from you, not lying," Cas's voice is already answering to his realization before the names of these emotions can settle in, before Dean can really take a grasp of them fully. "I will not do that again. But these memories, they might be uncomfortable to watch. I just don't want you harmed."

"You lived through them, didn't you?" Dean says, not waiting for an answer. "Surely it can't hurt me like the past hurt you. The least I can do is learn how bad it was."

Cas falls silent for a moment, then says very quietly, "Dean, some of them are really bad."

And Dean answers him, "Close your eyes then, if you don't want to relive them. Hold my hand if you want." They're not exactly face to face in any sense at this moment, mentally or physically, so really, it's just metaphorical. But Cas gets it. He doesn't argue. As if his consciousness leans back onto Bobby's sofa with a still slightly tensed back.

The view of the hospital tunes in and out, as if looking through a bad telescope, its focus lens screwed and shifting constantly. Dean squints at the view, feeling a nasty headache beginning to grow at the base of his skull just from trying to look.

He murmurs, "That's how you saw things during those times, Cas? And I was blaming you for being... you know, nuts?"

*That was on the better days,* Cas answers in thought.

"God, I'm sorry." A sigh slips out of Dean, "What's a bad day like?"

Cas stays quiet, but as if in response, the view shifts again. The hospital dissolves into a library, a beautiful, ancient library that Dean has only seen in the fanciest movie scenes. The arched ceilings are so tall they might as well be the sky, the corridors stretch long and wide. There are countless bookshelves with delicately carved markings and ornate decorations soaring toward the ceiling like the towering pillars of cathedrals from Roman era. And then there are the books, so many books that Dean imagines should all have been kept neatly on the shelves, indexed and illustrated, carefully sorted and placed. Except, they are not.

The library is a post-tornado mess. The remnants of its beauty and grandeur remain, but the books are so scattered that Dean doesn't know if there is a place he can step without accidentally treading on the loose pages -- instinctively, he knows these pages are important, every single one of them. The pages are torn and jumbled, the beautifully carved glistening covers lie among them all over the floor. The shelves are disoriented as well, only those in his immediate vicinity standing in roughly parallel lines. Further down the corridor, countless of them have been knocked over, the remaining standing ones are tilted left and right, as if someone had started fixing them but only managed to straighten the very few near the beginning edge of the wreckage, there is still so much more to go. The whole place looks more like a crumpled sea of random pages than a library, the papers piled on the floor, some fluttering in the air. The shelves look empty.

But when Dean looks closer, he notices the shelves are not all empty. The ones closest to him, the few that have been straightened and put back in place, some books have been reassembled and returned to the racks. The covers and pages are still visibly torn, but they remain standing at the edge of each rack. *Survivors of the tornado? Maybe?* Dean thinks, finding comfort in seeing that there are remaining books on the shelves, that the place is not completely ruined.

"What's this place?" Dean asks. Cas doesn't answer.

Instead, Dean finds his body kneeling down to the floor, reaching for a page -- not *his* body, Dean mentally corrects himself, it's Cas's memory, it's Cas's body for the moment. His fingers touch the page closest to him, and his eyes begin to read. There is an illustration of a cat on the page, a lazy tabby lying down, tongue stuck out, long and pink, staring at him. The text beneath it reads, "*Sharp spines or papillae can be found in a cat's tongue, there are five types of papillae...*" followed by some other notes and facts about cats.

His finger turns the page. On the other side, there is a different section about some other knowledge of cats, and it starts talking about "*Felines, especially domestic cats, are well known for having penile spines, which is needed to stimulate the female cat into ovulation...*"

He hears a low sigh escaping his throat, fingers brushing the words "female cat," and his voice mutters, "*I know for a fact the females were not consulted about that.*" The vision flickers between the library and hospital briefly as the voice comes through, like Cas is talking to someone in a different place. The view from the hospital is more like a translucent ripple overlay, but Dean catches a glimpse of himself and Sam standing there, faces worried and annoyed.

The view sharpens back to the library. His body stands up, and tucks the page into one of the books on the shelf to his right. The cover reads "*Anatomy of the Cat*", and it's about half as thick as the book is supposed to be, judging by the spine, all the pages loose. And with a glance, Dean realizes all the other books on the shelves are all in similar condition -- worn, torn, pages unbound -- but Cas is putting them back in.

Cas walks back to the pile of books that is mountain-high, and reaches down to pick up another page. This one has some monkeys dancing around a bonfire, seemingly singing and talking, as if highly intelligent, just like human... oh, not monkeys, those are the primal human beings. Dean glances at the note, which says something about Neanderthals and their poetries and rituals. Dean finds his head dizzy again. Cas, in the memory, in his mental body, just straightens up from the floor, walks over to the shelves, and slides the page into a different book on a different shelf, labeled "*Human Evolution*". And he goes back for the next page.

The realization weighs on his chest so heavy that Dean fears his ribs might get crushed any second. He wants to raise a hand to clutch his chest, but the body feels fine. Breathing is normal. The body is still moving through the memory, replaying the movement like a pre-programed robot.

The random comments here and there. The fragments of knowledge and glints of attention. "*Did you know that a cat's penis is sharply barbed along its shaft?*" "*I was backing the Neanderthals because their poetry was... just amazing. It's in perfect tune with the spheres. You guys ate the apple, invented pants.*" The Cas in the hospital, smiling at him wild and innocent like a child, holding up a finger saying "Pull it," and then starting to drop random notes about cats and dogs and monkeys and bees...

Dean stares at the pages and books and shelves again, feeling his eyes would sting if he had control over the body.

The pieces.

These are all the pieces of Cas's mind.

Broken.

Torn apart.

Like a tornado swept through the library. All the knowledge is still here, but so scattered, so broken, that he has to put them back, piece by piece, page by page, reading each one of them, putting them back in order, then moving on to the next. Each page might come from a far too different topic, a different book, a different area of the brain. He takes the page, walks to the correct shelf, places it between the covers, then walks back, and does the same again for the next one. Over and over again.

"*It took everything to get me here.*" Cas had already told him that, back then, in the hospital, hadn't he? But Dean didn't listen, he just, couldn't understand. Dean winces, wondering what had distracted him at that time, how he could let that statement slip past without really asking, "*What happened?*" Then he remembers. He was angry, back then, so angry that all he could think about was snapping at Cas, telling him to "button up his coat and help them take down the Leviathans," because he was thinking, that was all his fault. All the while Cas was in here, inside his own head, going round and round, piecing himself back together. Piece by piece. With no help.

"I'm sorry," says Cas.

His voice startles Dean.

"What?"

He means, *Why are you apologizing? I should be the one. I should have known things were difficult, so difficult. You were already doing your best, you're always doing your best. Whatever the result, you tried, you tried so damn hard. I should have known. I should have at least asked...*

And Cas says again, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry I destroyed everything. I'm sorry I was afraid I would destroy everything again. I'm sorry about all the mess and..."

"Cas," Dean stops him, barely able to find his own voice. "I'm sorry, too. And I forgive you, Cas. I forgave you a long time ago."

But Cas is still saying, "I'm sorry..." As if his mind has slipped back into that old broken self, looped like a faulty cassette tape, playing the only message it can still hold on to. His mental body picks up another page, and another. He reads them, and puts them in the right places. His thought moves faintly through the haze: *I'm sorry I was broken. I'm sorry I'm broken again. I need to piece myself together. I need to put myself back together because there is something important outside that needs fixing, because there is someone important outside who's waiting for me, because we also have too many important things to fix...*

"Hey, hey, Cas, Cas." Dean nudges him mentally, thinking to take back control from the spiral, focusing on the view of Bobby's living room, the sunshine spilling onto the carpet through the window.

And he is steered back into that warm bright sunshine and the lazy afternoon they never had. Cas slumps in the corner of the sofa where the sunshine can't reach, curled up small, arms wrapped tightly around his knees, as if trying to hold himself together the best he can. As if he really is still broken. His eyes are unfocused, his lips murmur over and over again, "I'm sorry."

Dean puts a hand on his shoulder. Cas startles. The loop breaks. His lips still tremble, but no sound comes out. His eyes fragile.

Dean lowers himself in front of the sofa, edging closer to his side, wrapping an arm around him in a gesture to pull the angel toward him. His eyes level with Cas's.

"Listen to me," he starts, then pauses, his thoughts wandering back to Cas's library. The grand, beautiful hall, the ancient shelves, the countless books. All the knowledge and memory he held, all the millions of years he lived through. What would it look like when Cas is not broken? When everything is ancient and elegant? Must be breathtaking. Must be as spectacular and beautiful as everything that Cas is. Dean tells him, firmly, "You're forgiven, Cas." And, "You're not broken. Even if you are, I can help fix, I'm good at it. Don't worry. We'll figure it out."

Cas's ocean-blue eyes focus on Dean's. The look of broken pieces is still lingering in that deep blue ocean water, like shattered glass floating on the surface of a wave. But he nods, small.

There is still so much glistening pain in those eyes, so much guilt and regret and apology, drifting like dark fog ghosting over the sea. But he tries to straighten up slightly on the sofa, all the while keeping his gaze locked on Dean, and says, after a while, quietly, "Thank you."

He leans into the arms wrapped around him, returning the embrace.

Dean holds him tight, hands caressing his back gently in a soothing motion. Like those huge wings once did.

<br>

#### Act 2

So Dean continues.

In the outside world, more light and grace flow through his palms, layering onto the giant vessel, coating the body like a blanket made of radiance. The body becomes visibly smaller now, shrinking from the size of a huge mountain and height of a skyscraper, to the size of a hill and possibly height of the tallest cathedral in the world. But the light fills in the gaps, as if it's not shrinking, just dissolving into a different form.

There probably shouldn't be that much light, Dean thinks, his eyes tracking the waves of brightness, wondering how the physics of grace works, and decides, if it triggers another physics lecture filled with all the terminologies from Cas, he'll have to skip the class.

But really, the grace is pouring from him and into Cas's body, not just channeling from the center of his palms, it expands to his whole hands, then whole arms, then, without needing to look down at himself, Dean knows his whole body is lightened up by the grace, and the light just continues flowing from everywhere. Unstoppably.

Should he be worried? Dean feels the first pull of panic start to coil in the pit of his stomach. Will it eventually drain Cas's grace? But really, is all this light coming from Cas's grace? The brightness and the way it flows, swirling and thickening, it feels familiar, it almost looks like the light is regenerating, multiplying, growing on itself like some kind of nuclear reaction.

Now that he thinks about it, that theory seems increasingly plausible. "Cas, am I going to explode into light or something?" Dean rushes.

"I don't think so," Cas answers, but the voice doesn't sound convincing. "I hope not."

That is when a great surge of grace dashes out of Dean, right near his heart, brushing hard against some core essence deep inside him. The warmth from the grace skyrockets into a near-burning sensation. Dean let out an uncontrollable yell that is bouldering pain. Though not exactly unpleasant, more surprised. *The Hell was that? Felt like my soul just got touched or something.*

*Yes. Sorry.* Cas's thought comes through as soon as Dean's own thought forms. *I'm afraid it might indeed be a chain reaction. Somehow, your soul is outputting energy along with my grace. I'm so sorry, I didn't know it was possible, I would never harm you...*

*I know, Cas. How do we stop a nuclear explosion?*

*I don't know.* Cas is deeply worried, making a mental move as if he's about to leave Dean's body.

*Hell no, you don't jump the car when it's racing out of control.* Dean keeps his hold on Cas steady, mentally and physically. *You buckle up for one hell of a roller coaster ride, you hear me? We sail through the storm, together.*

Dean huffs, pressing his hands onto the body harder. Judging by the way the light and power and electricity are pouring out, he knows as a fact, whatever is coming, he'll need a firm grip to keep from falling apart. Especially when there is someone else in the passenger seat.

<br>

The view ripples and shakes so violently that Dean loses sense of reality seconds later. The movies and images in front of his eyes shift so extremely rapidly like a tape player uncontrollably rewinding and replaying at random.

He sees a grey sky and ominous shades of trees swaying, monsters eying covetously. Dean sees his own back, from Cas's view, holding the bone blade, slashing at attacking leviathans and all other monsters. Cas dodges and ducks and strikes back at the ones that lunge at him, but all the while, Dean notices, his own figure always, always remains in the frame. Every time he's even slightly overwhelmed, Cas comes to his side.

He thinks back to his own memories, and the view shifts with his train of thought. He's killing the monsters, fierce and ruthless. He glares at the ones charging at him, and watches for the ones coming at Cas. He glances at Cas's hand that usually grips an angel blade but empty this time, he itches to hand him his blade. Instead, he throws himself in front of Cas, blocking the hideous looks those surrounding leviathans hurl toward him. He kills them before they can get within arm's reach to Cas.

*Oh.* Dean hears Cas's quiet voice murmur at the view from the back of the head, knowing he's watching the same scene replayed from a different angle for the first time.

*Yeah, fun time.* Dean shoots him a thought. *Nice teamwork.*

*It is truly great teamwork.* Cas agrees.

Then the swirly blue-white portal comes into view. At the first glimpse Dean isn't sure whose memory it is, then he knows it's Cas's, because the steps become more unstable and shakier than he remembers for himself. The portal draws closer with every step, Cas's pace grows slower and more sluggish by each step, but it's not from exhaustion. His own voice calls out from the memory, yelling over the the growls of monsters and the gust: "Come on, Cas, come on!" He sees his own eyes glancing back, checking on Cas, worried but hopeful, at least the way out is right in front of them now. Then there is Cas's thought replaying from the memory: *I should be left behind. I don't deserve to be saved.*

Dean blurts out at that, "You sound just like me when we first met, you remember that?"

Surprised, Cas stutters. He makes a sound that is like nothing other than swallowing. Then, slowly, "Yes, I remember. And I finally understand now."

"And you remember what you said to me back then?"

"Yes."

"Tell me."

"I told you, back then, good things do happen. You deserve to be saved."

Dean really wants to hold stare with Cas's eyes in this moment, but he figures Cas gets the idea. "You mean that, and you believe it?"

"Of course, Dean. For you, always," Cas answers earnestly.

"Then remember, same goes for you. Alright?" Dean tells him firmly.

*Even if my mistakes are far worse and more beings were devastated?* Cas doesn't put it into words but Dean receives the thought anyway.

The view now is composed of flashes of bloody scenes on Earth and even more horrifying scenes of dead angels butchered on the grounds of Heaven. Burned-out wings from dead angels stain the meadow for miles, there must be hundreds, if not thousands, of angels there. Cas stands in the center of the site, looking down at them, announcing his coronation and verdict as the new God.

Cas makes a terrified, sick sound at the view as if he's about to throw up.

Dean remembers the basement that night, the alien look on Cas's face, the disdain in his eyes when he said they were all but ants to him. He had been about to kneel before him, his heart thumping with such agony he couldn't breathe. Dean wasn't resentful, no, he was mourning. The Cas that was his friend was gone, murdered by his own hand, and this being with the same face was not Cas anymore, because even he'd already said so: "the Castiel you know is gone." Then Dean remembers the blood dripping from Cas's mouth, leviathans twisting his face. The floating, bloody trench coat in the water.

The view shifts to that lakeside, and the only thing in sight, is that damp trench coat, washed up and down by the water.

Everything is so hard to see, to think about, even harder to say. But he has to tell Cas this. "Yes, even with that. Hell, who says yours is worse anyway? I jump-started the Apocalypse, that didn't stop you from saving me. So yeah, no, wouldn't stop me whatsoever."

*Even if I betrayed you and hurt Sam?* This thought comes through extremely painful and difficult, as if it is literally cutting Cas open and tearing him apart again just by thinking it, blood would drip from the edges of the thought. But it is also so obvious he's never really stopped thinking it, never stopped beating himself up for it. Never will be, really.

Dean stumbles at that, but swallows and steadies himself. "Just... just don't do that again."

*I'm sorry.*

"I know. Cas. I know." Dean takes a long, ragged breath. "I forgave you. Now it's time you forgive yourself."

*How do you do that?*

Dean almost chuckles. "If only I know. But hey, we are on the same boat."

The flashing images from the memory slow down in the view: the broken pieces, the dazzling light, the confusing scenes of the dimension in between, the long and ugly past, the Hell, the Purgatory. Some are Cas's, others Dean's. Many times, they find the pieces mixed together. One by one, they pick them up, sort them out, as if cleaning a floor where all the glassware and chinaware have been shattered, and they work together to put them back, glue them together. The edges are sharp, the broken pieces tiny, but they work together. One by one, piece by piece, just like Cas puts torn book pages in his memory library back onto the shelves, just like Dean's djinn dream of the dimension in between, where they put the pieces of cloth fabric and feathers together to make a Picasso-style form turn to a Leonardo da Vinci work of art.

"There, you're the new Mona Lisa now. Fresh and new." After the last piece of aching memory flashes by and settles down, the view shifts back to the comfortable corner in Dean's head, back to Bobby's house. Dean pats fondly on Cas's shoulder, half-joking. *You're more beautiful than Mona Lisa.* His thought slips out, uncontrollably.

Cas tilts his head toward him, a small grin. "You know I can hear that too."

Dean flushes slightly. "Can't blame a man for thinking the truth."

His arms are still wrapped around Cas, their posture unchanged since all the roller coaster twists and turns began. And now, finally, it feels like they've landed somewhere.

The corner of the sofa where they stay, the sunlight covers it now. Warm and calming.

Cas uncurls his body, turning slightly on the sofa to face Dean. His eyes lock on Dean's, unblinking, watery.

Dean finds his own gaze drawn in like a magnet. He can see himself reflected in Cas's eyes. The intensity makes his head spin, the whole world around them disappears. He drowns in the blue, thinking, *Nothing in the world is more perfect.*

And an echoing thought returns, *Yes, there is. You.*

Dean blinks, eyes widening slightly, face flushed hotter.

Cas's eyes sweeps down, over his cheek, landing on his lips, then back to his eyes.

Dean catches every movement of his eyes, swallows, then leans in carefully.

Cas pulls him in, closing the remaining distance between their lips.

Dean closes his eyes, indulging himself in the feeling. His heart warm and swelling.

Cas is not the only one being pieced back together here.

<br>

#### Act 3

"Thank you for saving me," Cas says, once they finally pull apart.

"Any time." Dean grins. "You can thank me when we get you back into your body. Then we can do this properly."

They almost forget they're still only halfway done.

And the world is probably still on the ending track.

"We settled all the pieces?" Dean checks on Cas. "Everything inside and outside, angel and human? Fixed everything?"

Cas nods. "As good as we can for now."

There is still a faint sound deep down somewhere humming something heavy, if they had to guess, the shitty things never really go away for good, especially when the things they really want to get rid of is just a thought that's taken root. They can't even really tell whose it is, maybe both. Dean's known it his entire life, can feel it like a stubborn dark shade lingering in the corner of a whole palette of thoughts. But at least it hasn't solidified into a full sentence of thought yet, so Dean counts it as a win for now. Cas agrees quietly.

They shift their attention back to the outside. Reality sinks back in.

Dean checks on Cas's body immediately. The lights and flowing grace are more dazzling than ever. The whole ground where the giant body once lay is like a field made of light and energy. In the center of all the brightness, Dean is kneeling beside Cas's body, hands held together. The body -- Cas's body, made of flesh and blood like any human -- is returned to normal human size now.

The buzzing of the overcharged air is louder than ever, the electricity in the air makes every hair stand on end. Any friction feels like it could trigger a spark. Dean spares a split second to glance at the tear in space and the wildly darting aurora lights in the sky. Earth feels like it's on the verge of exploding, like a gigantic overcharged battery, about to burn like the Sun at any moment. Dean returns his attention to Cas, hoping they still have at least a minute or two.

Dean separates their hands, the lights stop pouring out of him, the ones already out there still surround the body. He regards the face of the body, the closed eyes, the crumpled coat. The body looks just like an empty shell, a doll, there is no expression on that face, no similarity to a life. Nothing like a man sleeping, more like a house with no one inside. He shifts uneasily.

"Want to try the first ride now?" Dean asks, trying to hide the nervousness.

*Honestly, not really. I'm spoiled in here.* Cas stretches mentally, his grace already starting to unfurl as he sends the last thought.

"I know, buddy. That's on me." Dean can't help chuckling, the worry dies down slightly.

He squeezes Cas's hand in the mental image one last time, then reluctantly lets it slip away. Cas puts his palms on Dean's cheeks, touching him one last time, then stands up from the sofa. The mental human form melts into bright silvery-blue light, casting dark shadows on the wall in the shapes of three spinning rings and three pairs of wings. Dean watches in fascination as the light flies upward, out of his mind's eye.

The warm sensation of Cas's grace dancing around his soul lingers just one moment longer, then Cas flies out. Dean watches the light flow from his mouth, moving into the vessel's, already missing the company inside his mind. That corner of his brain where Cas has occupied, the side of the sofa where the sunshine newly reached, that spot feels too empty now.

Dean pushes down the bubbling sense of emptiness, forcing his attention onto the body, onto Cas.

The new swarm of light has fully flowed inside the body, Dean assumes that means Cas, with all his existence, has moved into his new home now, in his entirety. He reaches back for Cas's physical hand, waiting for a twitch in the fingers or a blink of the eyes, anything.

Dean holds his breath, waiting, until his lungs protest. He resumes the breath, sharp and uneven. Cas's body still doesn't show any sign of life. No rising chest, no breath, no heartbeat, no pulse.

*You miss the timing, you're stuck with a corpse.* That was what Meg had warned him.

"No, no, no, Cas! Wake up, buddy." Dean starts to panic, he pats Cas's face, shaking his shoulder. His voice shudders, broken. "What did I do wrong? Don't do this to me, Cas."

He doesn't hear Cas's answer, only the louder and louder sound of electricity blending together from all directions, like the biggest thunder the world has ever known.

After Cas leaves, the view and all senses return to a human level, dull and limited, but Dean has a pretty good guess of what's happening. The sky is boiling with colors, all the red and purple and green dancing relentlessly, merging and splitting, forming shapes beyond imagination. The whole sky looks like it's about to tear open an entrance to the universe and pour everything down through the hole, just to make more space for more colors and light. The plasma must be reaching some extremely critical threshold now. His heart sinks to the lowest abyss.

"Can't believe it's still gonna end like this," Dean murmurs bitterly, letting go of Cas's hand. He fumbles on the ground for the demon blade he dropped earlier, and turns to face the tear of the dimension.

*Right when he thought he could have what he wanted for once, everything is gonna go to wreck again. Classic.* Dean almost laughs, at his own naivety thinking things would just be fine, at the cruel joke the world and fate throw at him.

"Here goes nothing." Dean grits his teeth, aiming the tip of the blade at his heart, closing his eyes. "*Death is an infinite vessel.*"

His hands begin to apply pressure to the blade, but the expected piercing pain through the chest does not come. Instead, he feels his wrists gripped tight by another hand, and a gravelly voice growls, "Dean."

Dean snaps his eyes open. There he is. Cas. Beautiful, glaring, bright, furious. He snatches the blade from Dean's hands, Dean can't find strength to resist. He can only throw his arms around Cas and hold him tight, breathing out shakily. "Thank God, Cas. I thought it didn't work."

"It took longer than I'd like to settle everything down in here. But I did not expect to see I'm almost too late *again* the minute I come back." Cas still sounds pissed.

"Oh, that," Dean pulls back from the hug, rubbing his nose, looking like a child caught stealing from a piggy bank.

"Yes, that! Thought we were over this self-sacrifice-to-save-the-world routine." Cas snaps.

"You got a better idea to fix it? 'Cause I don't really want to condemn the world again." Dean challenges weakly.

"Actually, I do. I just didn't think it was something I could have or use until very recently."

Dean raises his eyebrows, waiting for an elaboration.

Cas glances at the entangled soul-grace light still lingering on the ground, gas-liquid like, massive and blinding, still shaped loosely like a human figure, as if the phantom giant of his own form hasn't fully dissipated. He then looks at the tear, and finally back at Dean.

"It needs energy to fuel the patch, and something tremendous to close it temporarily, probably something infinite to close it for good," Cas starts. Dean nods, half understanding, half encouraging in anticipation.

"Angel grace is a good starting point -- it's a lot of energy," he pauses, and levels Dean a look. "And I supplied it with millions of years of knowledge and memory I had the last two times. It's not infinite, but with all the things I saw and knew, all the history of the universe from the beginning of time, all the people I witnessed and memorized, all the emotions I felt. Everything in my mind, the library you saw, it was enough to keep the tears closed long enough for the world to be safe for generations -- for you to be safe for your entire life. That was my initial plan this time too."

Dean makes a gesture as if he's going to argue, but Cas presses his hand down, just continues. "But now we have something better, so much better. We have the free energy," he gestures to the residual light on the ground, "the energy converted from the disappearing mass of the shrinking body, the beautiful physics rule of Mass-Energy Conversion. I have to admit, even I forgot to take it into account. And also from the chain reaction of your soul and my grace. We have more than enough energy."

"And the infinite part?"

"You see, Dean. Death is not the only infinite thing, and there is something else, so much more abundant and tremendous than the past and memory, so easy to forget the potential -- the future." Cas squeezes Dean's hands, pulling him closer, almost speaking directly into his breath. Dean can't tear his eyes away from the Angel. "The future is limitless, countless, endless. With you, between us, now there are infinite possibilities for where the future can go. The *possibilities* of what the whole world can become because of us, that is superfluous even for a different dimension."

"Wow," Dean gasps, truly awed, heart shaken. *That is the hottest thing I've ever heard. Poetic, too.*

He looks at Cas, almost expecting him to have already picked up the thought. Then he remembers they are not sharing a body anymore. So instead, he sends the message through prayer.

Cas smiles. "Yes, it is indeed very poe--"

Dean doesn't let him finish, he can't wait any longer. He's already pulling him in to close the very small remaining distance, and presses his lips to the open ones of Castiel's. The sentence is cut short.

He feels the dry and chapped lips, the warm and soft sensation, Cas's hands in his hair, his in Cas's. Sensations he missed when they were both in his head. Turns out, the mind just can't imagine everything. And this, this is so much better.

And he can't wait to see the infinite possibilities of the future, like Cas said, assuming the world doesn't end before that. Dean chances a look at the nasty tear of the dimension, the energy converted from the body mass is flying toward the gap as they busy themselves. The edge of the tear is starting to patch up from bottom to top, like the times he watched Cas's grace snitch them up on the Rocky Mountain and in the Redwoods.

Cas grunts a groan under his lips, complaining about his distraction. Dean makes a chuckling sound in his throat, putting his full attention back on Cas, ignoring the rest of the world now.

Cas's body is warm and solid under his touch, his tongue soft and gentle, his dark hair tangled in Dean's fingers, reminding him of when his fingers were intertwined with Cas's astonishingly beautiful starry-black wings and feathers. He tastes the clean earthy flavor of Cas's breath, reminded of the fresh wet air after a hot summer afternoon downpour. He feels the vibration from his heartbeat through the skin, hears his faint moaning sound in the throat. Dean uses all his human senses to feel Cas, to absorb him, wondering if he would feel him differently if he could have angelic senses just for a minute for this, if Cas feels him differently.

The world is forgotten in moments like this, all Dean can think of is Cas, and those infinite, literally world-saving, earth-turning futures ahead of them. And Cas, by the calm happy look on his face, his eyelashes quivering like butterfly wings, is thinking the same.

The kiss is not broken until long after the world falls silent.

"Listen," Cas manages, after what feels like forever. Time must have paused for them, the world must have stopped spinning for them.

Dean pants lightly, leaning his forehead against Cas's, tilting his head slightly to do as he's told.

"I don't hear anything," he reports. The surroundings are quiet, only the sound of pine needles rustling in the light breeze.

"Exactly," Cas smiles.

There is no hum of electricity, no charged air, no prickling feeling on the skin. Just the wind, the leaves, the natural quiet.

They look up at the sky. The aurora borealis still shimmers above the canopy, but it's returning to what it used to be, what it should be. Gentle waves of red and green take turns drifting across the sky, moving as the flowing wind moves the air. The view is still breathtakingly beautiful, yet no longer earth-shatteringly disturbing.

They look at the sky together, enjoying the view.

"Think that means the world is not gonna end anytime soon?" Dean beams.

Cas nods, content. Happy.

They go back to share another soft peck of kiss, then head toward the Impala.

The world moves on, the tear closed, the wounds patched. And the infinite future, just begins growing from here.

<br><br>

*Death is not the only infinite vessel. So is freedom. So is love.*

#### draft notes

(Cas's memory of edge of purgatory+in between dimension -> move to shift quickly between scenes)

- in between dimension: self-aware the monstrous form, own pieces, upset, worried; see Dean in seance, only an eye, talking
- ~~purgatory memory: watch Dean from back, thinking to leave behind, but doesn't want to harm his feeling, agree to go, but torn apart; the pain and the knowledge that glad to redeem, the regret~~
- know Dean's sacrifice plan, angry, sad
- ~~God!Cas time memory: devastated heaven, vaporized thousands of angels, killed humans, bloodbath; might kill himself (+flashback of Dean's plan, deliberately not mention as one of the "danger" if expelled but not summoned in time) => passing lines, quick~~
- ~~mad!Cas time memory: piecing his own mind together, hospital scene; pieces, again~~
- ~~620 big divorce moment, Dean's heartbroken eyes about his betrayal; 619 witness Dean with Lisa and leave: want Dean happy~~
- show how broken he was, how sorry he was, how deep he believe Dean wouldn't forgive him or want him back again, want to be left behind again, need to fix it too

Cas let Dean use his grace to fix the vessel, all the memories from Cas's POVs, for Dean to help piece him back (this is also the piece back/fix process, though neither knows)

How to fix the tear: mass-energy equivalence, the law of physics solves itself; grace/soul channel together, amplifying/catalyzing the mass-energy conversion, E=mc^2, when the giant body shrinks, the missing matters turn to energy, turn to chain reaction, energies fix the tear

(but the energy isn't infinite, so actually it's power of love)

Cas leaves Dean's body, own body remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, "Welcome back.", then solve the tear problem

*"Death is an infinite vessel, so is love."* (Cas knows, but he doesn't believe it's true so doesn't think it's possible) ~~(hinted requited love both ways but don't need to write it out)~~

~~use half Dean's soul+half Cas's grace to fix the tear, so Dean won't die & Cas's won't be gone/fall (or sacrifice a Meg? or use love to solve it? or Dean actually die once, but Cas resurrect him just quickly enough?) (mass-energy equivalence, the law of physics solves itself? feel fitting) (E=mc^2 + power of soul/grace (a bit soul/grace dance, chain reaction), actually power of love)~~

### Appendix: About the Physics (Not a Chapter)

The theoretical explanations that Dean cuts off but Cas would have explained, if anyone is curious:

**Refraction**: Think of when you poke a finger into a glass of water and look from the side, the finger appears bent and twisted. It's caused by different materials acting as different mediums for light, and each has a distinct speed at which light travels, thus different wavelengths.

The same thing happens when an angel passes through the boundary between two dimensions in the true form of wavelength: each dimension is a unique medium with its own unique property and speed for wave to pass. The wavelength is naturally altered and distorted at the boundary, can be enlarged when passing from one direction and shrunk from the other. That's why Cas's figure appears stretched and enlarged into a deformed shape.

**Diffraction**: A quantum mechanical effect that occurs when a microscopic particle passes through a slit that is roughly in the similar order of magnitudes with the particle size, the particle would diffract into an uncertain location (*Uncertainty Principle*) following a mathematical distribution of likelihood of where it may end up. The smaller the slit, the wider range it could potentially end up. The tear in space is comparable in scale to Cas's wavelength form, so Cas is subject to the Diffraction Effect, that's why he could potentially end up anywhere with no control of where he would land exactly, only a statistical likelihood to estimate.

**Infinity Mirror Effect**: When an object is placed between two perfectly aligned parallel mirrors, there will be infinite reflections of the same object inside the mirrors. This is to explain the phenomena witnessed when a tear is opened into the in-between dimension, explains why the cases are the strongest snowstorm ever, an infinite number of vultures, and the wildest aurora borealis. The objects that happened to be trapped between the dimensions and get infinitely reflected are the most ordinary, natural things -- one snowflake, one harmless bird, one plasma particle. But duplicate them by infinity (each one identical), it would inevitably become catastrophic. For the story's purpose, the reflections are also slightly twisted to render the situations extremely deadly.

**Wave-Matter Duality**: An angel's true form is a type of wave, the human vessel is physical matter, therefore according to classical physics, they are fundamentally different forms and there is no unified framework to reconcile them. But in quantum physics, Wave-Matter Duality provides a bridge to unify them: every matter is a wave, all matter has wave properties, differing only in the length of the wave and frequency of the matter.

Therefore in a sense, the human body is also a wave with a very limited wavelength, which explains why an angel can reside in the body, occupy, and move around in it. Also explains why Jimmy described hosting an angel as like flying with a comet -- the short wavelength of human matter has a difficult time keeping up with long-wavelength angels.

It can also explain the compatibility issue between certain human vessels and angels, and the concept of a true vessel. There must be certain necessary requirements to determine whether a vessel and an angel can fit together, based on wavelength and frequency. It is easy to imagine the requirement being their frequencies must resonate. Certain exceptionally strong vessels like those from the Novak bloodlines and the Winchester bloodlines, they can host most angels, demons, archangels, even multiple at once, suggesting their vessel frequencies must be highly adaptable and capable of resonating with a wide range of celestial wavelengths. Then it can also be deduced that celestial entities that have shared one strong vessel together are more likely to be able to exchange most of their other compatible vessels, including their respective true vessels. A "true vessel" must be the vessel whose frequency resonates most strongly with the angel's frequency, therefore very rare and very difficult to find.

And if we reverse the calculation, it would imply angel's size as a physical matter would be extremely small given their long wavelength. That is why an angel has to possess a human to walk the Earth, otherwise they would simply be too small to perceive.

Taking all that into account, when Cas says his true form size is as big as the Chrysler Building, he's referring to his wavelength. Now it's a calculation problem, a wave with a wavelength of about three hundred meters, it means the frequency is about 1MHz, which falls within the range of Medium Frequency (MF), commonly used by AM radio broadcastings and coast guards. No wonder he can tune in to police radio as well.

Using *de Broglie wave equation*, to have this wavelength, it would be equivalent to a proton moving at 10<sup>-9</sup> m/s or an electron at 10<sup>-6</sup> m/s, because the wavelength is determined by the Planck Constant and momentum, which in turn depend on the mass and velocity. So if Cas doesn't occupy a body and manifest physically in his true form on Earth, he'd have to be either extremely small or moving extremely slowly. Angel or not, he's bound by the laws of physics.

**Mass-Energy Equivalence**: According to Einstein's famous equation E=mc<sup>2</sup>, mass can be converted into energy in equivalence, with multiplied vacuum speed of light squared. So when Cas's spliced gigantic body gets shrunk from the size of the Chrysler Building to Jimmy Novak's height, the mass (proportional to volume, thus scaling cubically with height) would result in the release of approximately 3.85*10<sup>25</sup> Joules of energy, which is about 600 millions times more powerful than the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful nuclear bomb ever detonated. You wouldn't want to have him anywhere near downtown area, so thankfully all the occurrences of the cases are in reasonably remote locations (mountaintop, deep in woods, near Arctic), and Alaska is so very ideal, second only to totally desolated deserts. Let's just say this much energy is enough to seal a hole and patch a tear in the dimensions.

**The dimension in between**: The "dimension in between" is not any *single* dimension, not a higher or lower dimension, not the fifth dimension or the tenth dimension. It's a conceptual plane where other dimensions are flattened, including the time and space dimension. It's like two and a half dimension, or three and a half, a mashup of all the in-between dimensions.

In there, all the worlds in all the time and all the space coexist, as if they are all happening simultaneously in the same place. That is why when Cas is in there, when he notices light conjured from Dean's longing, he has no way of telling when and where that signal comes from. Because it could be from any time, any where, Cas wouldn't be able to tell the difference. If he goes imprudently to every call of Dean's, he might tear one hole to find a 26-year-old Dean, another to a 40-year-old Dean. That is also why it is a very real fear that Dean worries "what if next time you show up it's 20 years later, then 50." This can happen very easily, if not the now-Dean yearns the hardest, enough to anchor him.

That is also why the infinite future can actually be used to fill the hole and close the dimension in between: the future and the past are equivalent in there. The moment they realize this is possible, all the infinite possibilities become solid realities, it's like infinite versions of the multiverse before collapsing. No wonder it is adequate to fill any gap, patch any tear, seal any hole, make up for any damage anywhere.

At the end of the day, all the physics is just there to supply an explanation for why love can fix the world-ending problem. It's just another day where love saves the world.

Enjoy Cas's little physics class yet?

That class could use a curriculum textbook titled something like *"Theoretical Physics in a World of Magic and Fantasy"*.

<hr>

Cas: You have no idea what I've been talking about since the first sentence, do you?

Dean: No, but I love it when you talk abstruse, it turns me on. So, don't stop.

Instead of another lecture, he gets a kiss.

Or actually, more than just that.

### Supplements: Behind the Scenes (Not a Chapter)

Some credits, references, and inspirations. Some Easter eggs that were quite enjoyable to smuggle in.

<br>

**Chap. 2 "Into the Woods"**:

The legends of the giant fish and bird mentioned by Artemis: Quoted and translated from Zhuangzi's article "[Free and Easy Wandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book))" (庄周《逍遥游》), written around 300 BC. So the legend is indeed from over two thousand years ago. The first paragraph in original text goes like this: "北冥有鱼，其名为鲲。鲲之大，不知其几千里也；化而为鸟，其名为鹏。鹏之背，不知其几千里也，怒而飞，其翼若垂天之云。" I put these words in Artemis's mouth. I've loved the story of this giant fish turning into the giant bird [Peng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_(mythology)) so much ever since the first time I learned it in school. So when I needed an ancient myth about a big bird, this is the first thing popped into my mind.

How does Dean know the names of trees, plants, creatures, and birds: Apparently Cas has dragged him to watch the Nature Channel together more than once, and he actually paid attention, and secretly enjoys a lot but still pretends to groan and complain at every chance. Especially the bird part, he doesn't even realize he has a thing for them until much later. And here, when he's in the woods, he realizes he does memorize a lot of things and names he watched which is life-savingly useful, while thinking about Cas's wings. But still, even when they were watching the channel together and when he was definitely thinking about Cas's wings, he never really asked, so he never know Cas's wings' true color or how many pairs he has. Maybe there should be an epilogue, a timestamp, of them watching bird documentaries together or go back to Redwood again with Cas guiding and introducing the creatures and plants properly. And Cas might get surprised and impressed by Dean's knowledge.

<br>

**Chap. 3 "Amid the Tears"**:

"Something from the angel as the medium, the things he recognizes as his, to guide him to the call": The medium is not the trench coat or feather, it's Dean's body warmth left on them, it's Dean. It's always Dean.

Dean looks at the painted eye on Missouri's round table for seance and immediately starts staring at it: From Dean's view, it looks like Cas's eyes; from Cas's view, it's also what Dean looks like when only the "eyes of his mind" travel into the dimension in between. He has no body but only a big floating green eye, so it's also a very bizarre scene, disturbing even. Cas would have commented but never really got the chance to say that line or show more from his point of view.

<br>

**Chap. 4 "At the World's End"**:

"Does he dream about Purgatory when he's outside, or does he dream about outside when he's still in Purgatory": It might be a stretch to mention, but it's inspired somewhat by another ancient Chinese article of Zhuangzi's "[The Butterfly Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)#%22The_Butterfly_Dream%22)" (庄周梦蝶). The story is about Zhuangzi dreaming he was a butterfly and wondering if he was really Zhuangzi dreaming of being a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi. The confusion between inside and outside of dream world, it fascinated me for decades, and still does. So that djinn world storyline plays with that idea a bit.

The joke Amelia whispers into Sam's ear that cracks his laughter is: "I hope you won't name our kid 'Kid'."

Meg leaves a note saying Alaska is the World's End: In the design, Alaska is not the only end. There are other ends, anywhere that feels like you can't go any farther can be an "end." If that torn scrap were larger, Meg would have added another line there: "Try Ushuaia or Iceland if you like, but figured Alaska is the closest to you."

<br>

**Chap. 6 "Inside My Mind"**:

The quoting texts about cat biology in Cas's knowledge library: Quoted from Wikipedia.

The vast memories of a long-lived being, and the infinite possibilities of the future, enough to fill an infinite hole: Inspired by Doctor Who S07E07 "The Rings of Akhaten," one of my favorite episodes.

The unexpected nuclear reaction making the light and energy surge, to regenerate exponentially: It's triggered when Cas's grace and Dean's soul touch, they're like two halves of a nuclear core. The moment they connect, the reaction begins. They initially think it might be a chemical reaction, but it's far stronger than chemical-level. It's nuclear. Their bond is nuclear. Down to every atom and photon.

The memories and apologies and forgiveness and kisses inside the mind: They are parallel to the body-fixing process on the outside, and absolutely necessary in order to repair Cas's malform sequelae from the tear, to make him whole and help him remain stable in this dimension again. They think it's unexpected, but it's all an essential part of the fixing. Because, the dimension in between doesn't only shred and mess up Cas's body and form on the outside, not just the splicing of true form and vessel, but also inside the mind. As Dean realized earlier, the angelic memories and the screwed-up psychological knots and the deeply human emotions, those are shattered, jumbled, and in need of healing too. So they go through that fixing process in parallel, even if neither of them fully realizes or understands the necessity during the process at the time. They think they are simply handling the situation, facing another challenge as usual, holding on to each other at difficult times, trying to understand and support each other -- which is exactly what healing and fixing all about. (It isn't in the original writing outline, but it comes naturally. So it's not something the writer-god decided for them, they choose the path and go through the process by themselves.)

Why all the physics theories trying so hard to hopefully explain the supernatural situations: That part goes viral and out of control totally on its own. The very initial design was only to provide a quick explanation for why Cas becomes so giant, and then suddenly all the quantum mechanics and physics knowledge kicked in, and there was no stopping it. It is funny to imagine that Cas must be familiar with all the modern mathematics and physics, considering there are more than one occurrences in canon where he says things like "I can draw a diagram to explain this" or "write a series of partial differential equations to explain that". It wouldn't be a surprise if all those things we humans (and hunters) consider supernatural (especially the parts involving time and space and dimension) are only incomprehensible because we haven't discovered the science behind them, but angels know. Pretty sure the writers didn't see quantum physics playing a role when they wrote the line "multidimensional wavelength celestial being." Not even I came to think about Mass-Energy Equivalence until writing the last chapter, and then the world-ending crisis just solved itself. It has been so much fun to explore a difficult situation with no humanoid enemy to fight or negotiate with, only the natural order and the laws of physics. Only the reality of the world itself.

This is the second time in a row I've written a story where basically "love saves the world". Probably should stop doing that. Or not.
