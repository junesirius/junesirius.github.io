## Draft

### Art prompt

> Castiel leaves purgatory through the portal with Dean, but since Cas is in a vessel without a soul the human portal has unexpected consequences and Castiel is stuck in a spliced form of his true form and human vessel. Cas is stuck between dimensions and keeps fighting to get back to the same plane as Dean, and the process of reappearing creates omens that Dean can trace to find him when he does briefly appear in his giant form.

### Outline

time: October 2012

Dean comes back from purgatory, witnesses Cas get torn apart the moment he pass through the portal and disappears, doesn't know if Cas is killed in the process, determined to find Cas if he's not (self-comfort: maybe he's just pulled away, like angel-banishing spell). Dean goes to find Sam, Sam is living with Amelia happily, Dean decides not pull him out of apple pie life again, goes to hunt/search on his own, actively looks for monster/Leviathan/angel sign

Dean finds case of yeti in snow mountain (Rocky Mountain, Colorado), rumor says bigfoot trace but not bare foot, dress shoe trace, witness says seeing trench coat fabric but must be hallucination, Dean raises hope, starts searching, finds tear of dimension and bloody coat fabric in it (too big), believes Cas is out there (keep feeling being watched). finds actual Yeti escaped from purgatory, Yeti-Troll fights, Dean gets in between and almost gets killed, saved by angelic light but can't see Cas; the grace light weave into tear, sends monsters back and fix the hole, Cas gets pulled away as it closes [+Cas POV: dark, confused, chaotic, stumble foot print in snow, pulled away before manifest]

Dean follows giant monster witness report, rumor says Archaeopteryx (ancient first bird fossil) in place with huge tall trees (Redwood, California). Dean drives there, gets spooked, feels being watched but no one around, thinks he sees shape of giant Cas's wings in night black but disappear in blink (only get a glimpse), thinks he's going crazy, finds another tear of dimension and bloody feather in it (too big). almost gets killed by Greek creature Harpy (half-human half-bird, eat human, decapitation) and gets saved by Cas, protected by six huge black wings (Cas wants to talk but only in true voice and too loud, breaks glasses, but Dean is sure by now it's Cas), Cas gets pulled away again as the tear closes [+Cas POV: can't talk, can't stay, self-aware weird shape, watch Dean from the other side, see him hurt and fight to force through to save, weakened by each attempt]

Dean goes to Missouri, Pamela's seance had witnessed Cas's true form in multidimension then so can Missouri (use feather/coat fabric as medium), Dean gets info hint that Cas's true form and vessel are spliced and he's stuck, swears to find&help him. [+Cas POV: meet with Missouri in seance/spirit dimension, can talk/see, hesitant to come back because not want to continue tear dimension to endanger reality&Dean]

Dean drives around, keeps getting spooky feeling of continuously being watched, hears local legend of Cthulhu (humanoid, huge, tentacle, hundreds of meters tall) in Alaska, sees weird/astonishing aurora lights on sky, drives there. midnight, empty road, tear opens, sees giant Cas manifest in full size right in front of impala, wings+rings with eyes+trench coat, leviathans also come through the tear. Dean shocked/terrified/in awe then busy fighting, giant Cas kills them (easier than normal size but easily tired). Dean&Cas grab a few moments to talk/sync (the physics theory behind), Cas worries his reaction at first, Dean needs time to adjust, sees him for real now, not react/communicate well. Cas sensitive, feel rejected/upset, afraid Dean disgust/fear his true form now, self-aware being monster. Cas gets weaker quickly for staying in this dimension talking for long, fighting against natural order, and with the tear more leviathans coming through. For Dean's safety and Cas's own exhaustion, Cas gets pulled back and tear closes. [both POV, Cas upset, self-aware]

Dean's idea (convey through pray): expel him (S04E16 Alastair's spell; separate true form with body) and immediately summon him back (S06E21 angel summoning spell; avoid true form going into heaven), let Cas possess him as vessel temporarily, use his own power fix his vessel's size, jump back into his body. talk through Ouija Board, Cas hesitates for risk of hurting Dean (possession+tear open with monsters coming) and he won't be there protecting him, doesn't mention also afraid of getting expelled and not summoned in time make him end up in Heaven, "might kill himself"

Dean insists trying, ritual works, Cas shares Dean's body but both awake, Cas use mojo to fix vessel (Dean witnesses, amazed, "so this is how it's like, internally" "that sounds so wrong but whatever") and ready to go back into it (Cas all the time quiet), Dean mentally apologize and tell him his true form is awesome before Cas goes back (talk in Dean's brain, both normal: "You really think that?" "Yeah, I do"). Cas leaves Dean's body, vessel remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, problem solved, "Welcome back."

### Cas's pieces

- trench coat/tie clothing fabric
- wing/feather
- ring/eyes
- light/grace

### Monster inspire/reference

case fic? actually all Cas

- yeti/big foot: only see footprint (~3m)
- Godzilla: biggest ~300m
- Cthulhu: humanoid, tentacles, otherworldly god, hundreds of meters
- Mega-Kaiju: (Pacific Rim) biggest ~100m
- alien, transformer, predator, king kong

real case fic source of monster (stick with basics):

- vampire
- werewolf
- leviathan
- ~~ghost~~
- ~~demon~~

### Theory/physics

Tear of dimension: leave power/energy surge/draining, break wall between spaces, free traveling around between dimensions (≈purgatory exit)

Cas's true form: multidimensional wavelength celestial being, size of Chrysler Building (319m, ~1k feet)

Why giant: true form wavelength gets twisted at the edge of dimension, think of as how light get refracted on different media interface e.g. water-air surface; or quantum physics, wave-particle dualism, wave longer after passing through smaller slit, diffraction effect

Dean: "Cas, English" Cas: "going through portal makes me giant"

Dean: "Who's dragging you away?" Cas: "Law of physics"

Dean: "Are you saying you're here, but the other part of you is still in some wormhole space?"

Cas: "In a manner of speaking, yes"

Dean: "How can I get you back, the whole complete you, not pieces of glimpses here and there" Cas: "I don't know" don't know if it's even possible, or if he really wants given the risks on Dean

Solution: needs to separate true form from vessel, expel him then bound him again, banishing+summoning spell+holy fire circle

(above is conversation during seance by Missouri)

### Reference

ominous spooky feeling: ≈P3 Sirius Black bad omen black dog (fearful but fundamentally good-natured, mysterious, suspension)

high dimension: Interstellar (2014, not released yet; current=)

### Easter Egg

Chap. 2, the legends of the giant fish and bird: quote from 庄周《逍遥游》“北冥有鱼，其名为鲲。鲲之大，不知其几千里也；化而为鸟，其名为鹏。鹏之背，不知其几千里也，怒而飞，其翼若垂天之云。”

Chap. 2, how does Dean know about the names of the trees, plants, creatures and birds: apparently Cas has dragged him to watch Nature channel together more than once, and he actually paid attention. Especially the bird part, he doesn't even realize he has a thing for them until much later and also in here, he realizes he does memorized those things and names he watched, while thinking about Cas's wings. But still, even when they were watching together and when he was definitely thinking about Cas's wings, he never really asked, so he never know Cas's wings true color or there are three pairs of them. (could potentially add an epilogue of watching bird Nature channel together or go back to the Redwood again with Cas guiding and introducing the creatures/plants, and Dean's knowledge surprise Cas too)

### Dean's mental state

≈S08E01-07

focus on guilty, heavy self-blame, feel crap for not getting Cas back complete

he can only save Cas if he lets go of some of that blame/guilt

mission mode, focused on saving mission

### Cas's mental state

≈S08E07-10

focus on self-punishment, torn between dimension and true form & vessel=torn between saving heaven vs earth, choosing angel vs human, go back to purgatory for self-punishment vs go back to earth to help/protect Dean

so every time Cas fights hard to tear through dimension to get to this plane, to protect Dean, he gets more wounded and weaker in celestial part, so the fighting back itself is a step closer to the final decision point and away from torn state, so finally he can get out of the intertwined quantum superposition state, he comes back to Dean once he figure out he can only protect Dean if he forgives himself (more or less), his choice is always Dean more than anything else

**core curve**: Cas needs to really decide on the answer to "What are you, angel or human" (if angel, true form; if human, body) -> but he *is* both

#### Act 1

Dean slams on the gas hard, the stolen car roars in exhaustion, kicking up the dirt along the way. Dean rolls the window down, not caring the dirt flowing in and out. Not like they could make his face any dirtier than he already is. Not like there is any place on Earth can get any dirtier than the place he just came back from.

The night road stretches, ahead, and broad on both sides. Empty. No sight of another human being, not a single passing car. The frogs croak loudly in the fields along the road.

Dean just stares at the road, and drives. Like it's the only thing he can think of. It's the only thing he can still trust himself to do, without breaking anything, or losing anything, again.

He drives on the freeway from the 100-miles wilderness in Maine, to west, to south, to anywhere the road leads him to. He drives, so he doesn't need to think, or talk, or eat, or sleep. As if it can just last so long, that all the things he left behind, all the things he just lost, would never catch up.

<br>

They still catch up. Of course they do. The images and sounds and smells of that filthy place. The memory of everything happened in the past year. They catch up to him and circle him around, like a snake coils around its prey before devouring the food in whole when they are still alive. Dean is the food and prey of the anaconda conjured by his own brain, made up of this bitter bloody thing called "memory".

"Dean --" He remembers Cas calling his name. Desperate. His eyes on him. His hands in his. His whole life and trust and everything he carries, all put in the hands they held together. Dean saw them all in Cas's eyes, heard them all in his voice. Dean grasped him tight, and didn't let go.

The palms were slippery with blood and sweat. Every inch of his muscle in arms and backs screamed in stretched and strain, the stress turns into sharp pain shortly, but he didn't let go. He didn't. Cas's whole weight leaned onto him, depends on him. So Dean held him tight, just as desperate, like the whole world was on the hands he held, because it might as well is.

And then, it stopped. The weight disappeared. The hands loosened. They stepped over the portal together, Dean remembered agonizingly clearly, he fell onto the solid ground of the sweet Earth, and two feet besides him where Cas was, it was just a blast of bright light, and then, there was nothing.

He heard Cas's scream, whether it's his human voice pitching too high or it's his shrieking angel voice, he couldn't tell. All he saw was the silvery light of Cas's grace exploded in front of him, torn apart at the moment of passing. His last voice broken and painful. He yelled for him for the last time, then he was not there anymore. Nowhere to be found.

Cas had mentioned too damn many times they had no idea if the portal would allow an angel to pass, but they agreed to try, together. And they did. But just like every other long shots in their bloody lives -- the bleak hopes, the only plan, they never work.

Dean yelled Cas's name, shouted until throat hoarse. He would have torn the reality a hole right then and there if he knew how, just to tear open the portal again, to see if Cas fell back into the Monsterland. He would jump back into the place to get Cas back, he swore, just like he had told him, the bottom line is, they are going home together, and he wouldn't leave if Cas is not here with him.

But promises are empty, swears fall into nothing. He is here, and Cas is not.

Dean stares hard at the front of the windshield, gazing at the road so hard and rigid without blinking that it starts making his eyes watery. Cas should be here, by his side, sitting in the shotgun. They should come home, together.

Dean punches the wheel, swearing, cursing. The first hint of the sunrise emerges from the end of the road, piercing right into his eyes. He blinks in the sudden light, the golden color looks nothing like Castiel's grace but light is light. Dean blinks again, the dried eyes finally condense enough moisture at the corner that threatens to drop.

Dean wipes his eyes with the back of his hands. The wetness mixes with the dirt and dried blood stains that still cover his hands, making a mess. He presses the accelerator pad harder, urging the vehicle forwards, as if he's rushing to a destination, as if he knows where to go, or where to find Cas.

"You are not dead, Cas." Dean growls at the empty road ahead of him. "You're not gone, I know that. Just blown away by the portal or something. I'll get you back, Cas, I promise. I can find you in the Purgatory, I'll find you again."

The car rolls ahead in a louder engine moan, speeding on the road that is slowly lightened up by the newborn sun.

<br>

All of Sam's cellphones are offline, Dean tries every single one that he can remember, but pretty much always get a robotic voice telling him empty service or empty number, barely even any having Sam's recorded voice played out, asking for a voicemail. He tries his own old cells too, no difference.

It takes three days to track Sam down again. The patterns and old habits die hard, traces scattered around like bread crumbs. He rolls into the small town of Kermit, Texas, parking in front of the white fence house.

Thin white curtain with laces half covers the room. He glances inside.

Sam stands by a woman, holding her close. The two of them are kissing, gently. For the most of the time, they are just holding each other together, his hands on her shoulder, hers on his waist, simply having their foreheads pressed together, breathing each other's breathe, like the way when people dancing to an old classic waltz.

Dean looks like this white-fence apple-pie life they had talked about, sometimes dreamed out, never once really believed can be theirs.

He drives away. Leaving the house in his rearview.

They even have flowers with small purple blossoms in the garden, poking out between the fence, ignorant of the early winter chillness of October.

Dean leaves the town after the midnight -- but not before he sneaks into the garage and drives away in his canvas-covered impala. The keys hang by the garage door.

*You get a home now, at least let me have mine.* Dean thinks when he sits into the familiar driver's seat, reversing onto the road, wondering for a minute how long it would even take before Sam notices the impala isn't where it was. For a brief moment, he wonders if this is exactly how Cas feels, seeing him with Lisa right when he was knee deep in trouble but didn't have the heart to knock on that freshly painted door.

You don't knock on a door like that, not with the hand that can never wash clean from the layered and dried blood stains.

He leaves the town under the starry sky, the road empty and vast like it always is these days.

<br>

#### Act 2

There are still work to do. There are always work, somewhere. Monsters, ghosts, something dark, something evil, something lurking in the dark, waiting to tear people's heart out or drink their blood dry.

Dean is good at finding things in the dark. But this time, he's looking for something in the light. Something bright and glaring, fluffy and feathery, something -- someone -- holy and angelic.

As much as he would say angels are nothing more than monsters with good PR, as many times as Cas has explained he doesn't have a harp, it seems when he thinks of Cas, he still can't help thinking of halos and wings. The same image in his mind until he was four, every night when his mom told him angels were watching over him. So that's what he looks for.

It is starting to grow into a routine. Dean gets into the habit of picking up a piece of newspaper at the breakfast and reading through over the coffee. Then he sits in the cafe for a whole day going through people's mention of angelic encounters online. He scans and scrolls, reads and looks, squints at the words of the witnesses and illustrations from the visionaries, thinking, if any of these is a sign of Cas. If any of them can be luckier than he is, and has a glimpse of Cas while he cannot.

Then he drives, and reads, and asks people around if there is anything weird and holy happening, anything like sudden increased temperature or bright lights and thunderous sound, and orders the paper and coffee. Then he hits the road again.

The days and roads muffled together. Dean distantly realizes he might get as bearded and dirty as he was in Purgatory, and he decides he doesn't care. He punches the word "angel" into the laptop searching bar again.

<br>

There are some pagan gods in Wyoming, some werewolves in Michigan, and then some more pagan gods in Colorado. Dean takes care of them.

He has hoped maybe some of those pagan gods could have enough juice that he can negotiate to use. But at the end of the day, none of them are anything more than a bunch of bloodthirsty sons of bitches. Dean buries the knives into their chests or cuts their heads off, whatever works.

Blood of the gods and creatures splatter onto his face. Dean gets so used to it now he doesn't flinch or blink.

Some of these days, the Earth feels no different from the Purgatory. Full of ugly things, and none of the one he's looking for.

He still prays every night. And he drives on.

By November, he has cleaned a nest of vampires in Washington and killed a nasty spectre in Missouri. The winter is falling onto him quickly. But the coldness is the last thing he would worry.

The first snow catches him when he's in Rocky Mountain, Colorado, thinking of cutting the state in a short cut, when the blizzard almost buries half the car. He stays in a tourist center on the waist of the mountain, stuck with a group of chatty tourists too stupid to travel without checking weather report, staring at the roaring snow outside of the window painting the whole world white and blank. Separated from the rest of the world.

There was no snow in the Purgatory. Or rain. Or sun.

Everything was just grey and bleak, trees half-dead with only trunks standing, ground covered by dirt of corroded skeletons.

So at least, if nothing else, the snow is a good reminder that this is really the Earth. Dean watches the strong wind blowing snowflakes as large as his palm onto the window, then adding layers after layers. The view soon blocked by the thick cover of snow and ice.

"No, I'm telling you, it's true, there are yetis in this mountain. Legends say they only come out in storms like this, feeding on lost hikers. The snow hides their traces too well so they are super difficult to track, but we still manage to take the photos." Some remote chatter reaches his ear. Dean focuses on the bitter coffee in his hands, trying to block out any mention of new monster or legends. He isn't really in a hunting mood right now.

Coldness seeps in from the gaps of the windows.

He hears laughter from the crowd, whatever photo that man is showing around, the rest of the group isn't buying. A young woman's mocking voice is loud enough for him to hear from across the lobby:"This can't possibly be a bigfoot trace, Hector. What do you take us for, idiots? Look at the footprint, it's not even barefoot, might as well be a size-hundred dress shoe. Unless you're saying yetis start wearing suits and dress shoes?" The crowd bursts into laughter.

Dean lowers his head and takes another drink of his coffee that's already getting cold. Cas used to wear dress shoes. It's been a long while seeing him in the suits though, with everything so messed up and he ended up in a hospital gown that even got carried over into the other side of the portal, Dean finds himself missing that suit and funny little reversed tie.

He doesn't realize a tiny little curl starts pulling on the tip of his lips.

It's been too long. The last time they were both themselves, it's like years and years ago. Decades even, so it feels. Before the Purgatory, before the broken Sam, before the Leviathans, or Raphael. Long, long, time ago when he can still straight his ties, and tells Cas he's "also an FBI", only to watch the badge got displayed upside down.

God, how he wished this is still then.

His lips drop entirely. He drinks another sip of the coffee. It's completely cold now.

"If you don't believe the photo, I guess you won't believe what I saw by my own eyes, then." The man that must is Hector insists, voice over the lingering chuckles that haven't died down. "I swear to God, on the day I take the photo, I see a yeti that is so much larger than any in the record. It must be at least sixty feet tall, and the most weird thing is its color. Not like any other white yetis, this one has a beige color, and the back standing so straight, if I don't know any better, I might say it's a giant in a trench coat."

Dean jerks up his head so fast he even startles himself. He jumps to his feet, marching towards the group and grabbing the man by the collar before he even realizes what he's doing. "What did you say?" He scowls right into the man's face.

Hector stutters. "Chill, man. Just some story time. I was telling the ladies the other night when I was on the mountain. Just so happened to see this weird ass yeti."

"The trench coat, what's it like?" Dean shakes his collar, the man is practically raised to his toes like a cat picked up by the neck.

"Are you crazy? I don't know, just a trench coat. I mean, it's probably nothing, lights and reflections or something." Hector protests and pushes at his shoulder.

Dean lets him go. "And you say he's on top of the mountain in a snow storm like this one?"

"*He*?" Hector flattens his wrinkled clothes, laughing, "Yeah, sure, on the highest top, standing by a big pile of fire with cooked human meat, dancing with other female yetis!" The group of tourists burst into a huge outburst of laughter.

Dean turns around, walking straight towards the door.

"Sir, it's too dangerous to go outside in this weather." One of the workers of the place calls after him.

Dean doesn't look back. "I'm going." He says.

<br>

#### Act 3

It's freezing cold outside. In fact, "freezing" is just too weak of a term for this temperature. Any word that can be thought of for this weather has already been blown away by the blizzard and frozen into the ground.

The snow has heaped up and frozen the door of the place. He has to climb out from one of the highest windows near the ceiling. The building is mostly buried in the unprecedented storm -- the most fierce and sudden one that ever hit in all the recorded history, according to those people back in there.

Dean can sense every inch of his skin dropping temperature fast, he might only have minutes, or seconds, before his body is frozen into some ice sculpture. He maybe -- extremely likely -- literally frozen to death, if he's not buried alive first.

But knowing what he knows now, there is no way he would just sit inside and do nothing. He can fight through the Purgatory from one end to the other, certainly he can survive some snow storm in Colorado.

Dean walks into the storm, and starts walking towards the mountaintop, where the rumors hold. The snowflakes are as sharp as angel blades, cutting him bloody, but there is no dripping blood. Even the sliced veins are frozen to closed the minute they're wounded.

He can't see anything, there is nothing other than a whole complete whiteness in front of him, with all kinds of different shades. He pushes one step after another, but can't tell the difference between each step. He wonders if he's really moving up, or just making the same movement in the same place.

The storm gets more fierce when the top is nearer. The trees are getting sparse, the color of the snow darker. Dean widens his eyes to the biggest extend, searching the sky, the ground, the wood, the mountain. Searching the whole world for a glimpse of color that is different from the whiteness. Looking for a footprint or a hint of beige.

"This is suicide, Dean." The voice he's way too familiar with sounds up somewhere close by.

"Cas?" Dean spins around, turning sharp towards the sound.

"Dangerous, reckless, and stupid. You could die here, buried alive, and I'd never find you or your corpse again, you ever thought about that?" Cas's voice scolding.

"What?" Dean stills. Thinking, then tries, "You're not real, aren't you? I'm hallucinating you?"

"Hypothermia could lead to highly realistic hallucination. It's scientifically tested and confirmed already." "Cas" walks out of the storm, standing in front of him. In his clean trench coat and straight suit, blue tie tilted and reversed in the front. Hairs unbelievably disheveled but not moving in the storm wind. Eyes as blue as the deepest sea and highest autumn sky. The view of the Angel-of-the-Lord as he remembered from the first time they met, the look he forever dreamed about among all the other looks that he had.

"Cas." Dean murmurs, reaching out to him, fingers catching nothing but snowflakes. Though the snow doesn't feel cold anymore.

He pulls a sad smile, looking at "Cas" in the eyes. "I've been looking for you, Cas. Promised I'd find you and bring you home. But looks like I can't even keep that promise, I'm sorry."

"Cas" has a smile just as sad as his. "You're dying, Dean." He tells him, something he already knew, and then, "I won't let that happen. I can't."

Dean can't really think straight right now, about the meaning of the sentences. The low temperature makes his brain as sluggish as his hands and feet, working slower by each second, just like the gradually slowing down heart beat sound that he hears of his own.

That is when the view in front of his eyes changes entirely. Dean blinks slowly, can't understand what he's seeing.

It is as if the storm is split into two halves, like a curtain drawing open on the opera stage. To his left and right, snows and blizzards continue, but right in front of him in the middle, a figure as tall as sky emerges, stepping towards him slowly. Each step stomping on the ground, shaking the earth, like the giant from the Jack and Beanstalk story.

Dean wants to step back, wants to look up, wants to speak. There are so many things he wants to do, the instinct is telling him to run away, or to fight, but his body is too frozen to move. So he just stares, feeling the newly risen adrenalin forcing the heart beating faster. His brain struggles to parse the reality and the view.

The figure wears a long trench coat, reaching to his knees, which is taller than the highest tree in their surroundings. Dean looks up, head as high as his frozen neck allows but still can't see the head of the figure, barely reach the skirt of the trench coat sweeping in the storm. He gasps, his sound choked in his throat.

It is Cas. It is undoubtedly Cas. But it is so unlike Cas, not in any form he has ever known. Not in any history or legend. But it is Cas, for sure. He just knows.

Dean would know him from anywhere, in any form. Not just the trench coat, but his existence. The weight of his stare falling on to him even if he can't see his eyes; the heat of concern radiating from his body, almost practically melting the snow and ice surround them. And most of all, who else would ever like this, always comes to him at the moment of dying. Hell is the first time, Green Room the second, Dean has long lost count of how many more are there.

"Cas." This time Dean really is smiling now. Dirt and snow and hint of blood and cuts smudged on his face, making the smallest pull of muscle a pain, but he's smiling now, big and stupidly.

He steps forward, but Cas retracts. There is a thunderous sound rolling from above, as if coming directly from the sky, low and deafening, like the rage of Greek gods befalling on top of the Mount Olympus.

But it's not a voice of rage, nor warning. Dean can't understand the syllable, but if he knows Cas at all -- which he does -- then he'd know, this is his own name. He would have known his own name in every single tongue Cas speaks, and the tone would remain the same.

He takes another step forward, carefully, but Cas's figure takes another step back. One step, and he's a hundred feet away. The blizzard around them starts roaring again, reaching back to the same amount of intensity and fierceness. But closely around Dean, there is still a safe little area of warmth, blocked out from the storm, like a bubble in space, sparkled golden and silver, the color of Cas's grace.

"What's wrong?" Dean manages, sound overshadowed by the blizzard the moment they leave his mouth.

Cas makes another sound, one word, not "Dean", certainly not "Hello".

"No, no, no, no! Cas!" Dean yells, desperately, instinctively, "Wait! Don't! Not 'Goodbye' again! Not so soon! Stay, please!"

Cas turns around, stepping aside. That is when he sees it. A tear in the space, like a big ugly wound of the reality standing vertical, opening up like Sauron's evil eye glaring down at the earth. Grey and black smoke flowing in and out of the edge, like curtains flying in the wind, more ominous than when Hell's Gate is opened. The blizzard starts right from the center of it, and god knows what other things must have come through from that hole.

Cas must be blocking the hole with his own body -- this giant body he has now, however that happened.

"Cas..." Dean hates it he can't do anything, especially when he knows exactly what is going to happen next, the same nightmare that he's been having for ages, after the day of the Cage opening, after Cas walking into the river. The same worst thing he feared every single night at the Purgatory, and it seems, with Cas, it's just gonna keep replaying.

Dean tries running, forcing his frozen legs and body to move, forcing himself to close up the distance between. He runs as fast as he could. And Cas takes one step back, putting another hundred feet between them. Then another.

Cas is right in front of that huge tear of the dimension now. Bright light start leaking out from him, seeping into the opening, weaving onto it like needles and threads fixing a patch on a piece of cloth, closing it bit by bit.

"Please..." Dean begs, so quiet even himself can barely hear it. Cas's figure starts fading, lights dimming, the hole shrinking. But right before it gets completely sewed up by the bright light of grace, a slicker thread of light flies away from the rest, flying towards Dean.

Dean watches it, dizzily, not realizing his eyes are so teary that the light of the grace is all fuzzed and smudged like a piece of soaked art. The thin thread of light fly onto his forehead, touches his skin and immediately sinks into it.

The warmth soaks him from top to bottom, like the best hot water shower he could use at this moment, chasing the last hint of coldness from the snow storm out of his body. The exact same feeling whenever Cas touches him and heals him.

Dean looks up again. At the place where the tear of the space was, it is now a clean smooth stand of sky, and air. There is no nasty thing from other dimension, there is no bright light of needles and threads.

There is no Cas, again. Not even a sign to prove it wasn't a dream. Except for the lingering warmth that still flows in his body.

The killing snow storm has stopped, he realizes belatedly, when the tear is mended, when Cas is gone.

He stares at the sky that is clearing. Blue as crystal.

A piece of fabric, drifts down from the middle of air, slowly flying to the ground, landed on the snow. Beige color, trench coat texture, torn and blood stained.

Dean picks it up, puts it in the chest pocket closest to his heart.

<br>

#### Act 4

It is dark.

This place.

It is shredding.

Cutting.

Confusing.

Everything is pieces.

Just pieces.

Floating.

Swimming.

Chaotic.

The dimension in between.

<br>

It takes time, really long time to find the pieces together.

But what is time, when time is not a dimension.

When time, can also be torn apart, like everything else, in this dimension.

Words are difficult to find, with characters and syllables.

Mind and body and grace and existence alike.

Which is the right place, for which piece of puzzle, floating by.

Woven, with the pain and bitter and guilt and penance.

Kneading, into every fabric.

Every fabric of the dimension.

Every fabric of one existence.

Who is building me up this time?

Not God. Me.

I'm putting me together.

But, then, Theseus's Ship,

Who am I?

<br>

It is dark.

Behind the curtain.

Lights are out.

Tear it down.

No,

Tear it open.

The light is on the other side.

<br>

Then,

Snow and cold.

Pain and real.

Torn and broken.

I see you.

<br>

Hello.

I'm sorry.

The lights are out again.

The curtain is drawn back.

Too quick, too short.

Back, dark, torn, away.

Don't cry.

Not goodbye.

### Chap. 2 (Harpy)

> **Outline:** Dean follows giant monster witness report, rumor says Archaeopteryx (ancient first bird fossil) in place with huge tall trees (Redwood, California). Dean drives there, gets spooked, feels being watched but no one around, thinks he sees shape of giant Cas's wings in night black but disappear in blink (only get a glimpse), thinks he's going crazy, finds another tear of dimension and bloody feather in it (too big). almost gets killed by Greek creature Harpy (half-human half-bird, eat human, decapitation) and gets saved by Cas, protected by six huge black wings (Cas wants to talk but only in true voice and too loud, breaks glasses, but Dean is sure by now it's Cas), Cas gets pulled away again as the tear closes [+Cas POV: can't talk, can't stay, self-aware weird shape, watch Dean from the other side, see him hurt and fight to force through to save, weakened by each attempt]

#### Act 1

He takes two days driving from Colorado to Louisiana, another two days from Louisiana to Michigan.

Dean can't help touching the piece of trench coat fragment in his pocket, as if it's heating up, burning on the skin where his own heart beats. But it's just some clothes.

The leaves of the trees grow wider and larger as he goes south, then thinner and taller again as he heads north.

The laptop search bar has a new frequent search words: "giant monster". It turns out people online tend to report even more witnesses of something huge and monstrous than that of holy or hellish.

Dean picks the roads no one walks or drives, the roads in between trees and deep in the mountains. The mountains where legends say giant monsters and pre-history creature lives.

He runs into a lone vampire making a living hunting bears, and a fairy living in the woods with a goat mask. But not another "yeti" or "bigfoot", certainly no mention at all of any creature with trench coat-colored skin.

The snow starts melting by the road of the Midwest and Lake area. It's been months since Rocky Mountain, even longer since Purgatory. Leviathans fade into memory of a previous life, demons and Apocalypses are like stories that other people tell.

Once, in the middle of the night, on his way driving to Montana, Dean finds himself wondering, if this is gonna be the rest of his life. Drifting on the road, searching, alone, not even hunting, not really. Just looking, finding, going after the angel that he lost.

"Cas, what if the next time I find you is twenty years from now?" He ponders aloud, half speaking to himself half pray, if this can still be called pray. "What if you get pulled away again after that, and the next after is fifty years later. Or a hundred. What then?"

"I might end up in a trench somewhere, one day, become some bones. Then who will continue look for you, bring you home?"

Hours condense in nights like this, moving slowly, minute by minute. Words coagulate. But days and weeks flash by quick.

He has no answer. So he pushes the questions away. He could think of nothing but finding Cas when he was in Purgatory, and it is no different now. Even if it's going to take the rest of his life.

He wasn't planning on coming back to the life on Earth anyway, back there, before he found Cas. Until he found him.

So here, now, on the Earth. It has to be easier. It has to.

The road stretches ahead like used tapes roiling back in a cassette player, miles and miles putting behind the wheels.

Cas is not in Montana, either. But he does run into more gods and such. Zeus and Prometheus die in the same day, and he gets to meet with Artemis, the goddess of his occupation, supposedly the protector of all hunters. It isn't the worst day of his life, all things considered.

That is when Artemis tells him the legend of one giant ancient bird. After he asked nicely.

"There is this giant fish, born in the northern sea, the head to tail stretching thousands of miles long. It turns into a giant bird, no one knows how big it is, must be tens of thousands of miles wide. When it flies, its wings spread like the clouds covering the sky. When the winter stirs the sea, it flies to south. Its wings flap on the water, the sea lifts waves of three thousand miles high. It flies upwards, the swirl of its body creates tornados from ninety thousand miles high in the sky. The wind and air is its breath, the blue in the sky the color of its feathers. Ancient Greek and Chinese all have records of it from thousands of years ago. Is this the giant ancient creature that you're looking for?"

Dean swallows, thinking about the shadow of Castiel's wings on the barn walls the first day they met. "Maybe," he says. "Does this bird has a name?"

"Greeks and Egyptians call it Phoenix, Chinese call it Peng, archeologists call it Archaeopteryx, you're calling it Angel already. Does the name matter?"

Dean shakes his head, dumbly. "And where does it -- he, they -- live and rest? This northern sea it born from and the southern place it flies to, where are they?"

"It only rests on the oldest and tallest tree, thriving from the age of glacier and dinosaurs, taking eight thousand years as spring, and eight thousand more for autumn."

Dean blinks, blankly.

Artemis lets out a short sigh. "Redwood, California."

"Thank you!" Dean blurts out, "Next time, start with that! Now I can see why Greeks have Minotaur and Sphinx."

#### Act 2

Artemis wasn't kidding when she said the trees were ancient old. Only has a few digits give or take on the specific age.

The foresters say the oldest redwood in the park should be at least two thousand years old.

Dean walks into the woods.

Surrounded by the trees towering over the land, rising into the sky, no human can avoid to be reminded of how tiny they are. Dean is no exception.

He walks among them, awed and uneasy. He can't shake the feeling there are stares looking down at him from above -- not in the way like Cas's stares, but in a bad way like spiders monitoring preys. But he doesn't know if it's the trees themselves being too loud and alive, or something else perching on the top. The instinct makes the hairs on the back of his neck stand.

The trunks of the redwoods sheer upwards, chapped and crannied, too thick to be encircled by probably a dozen of grown men. The crowns cover the sky, leaving the space in between gloomy, with only glitters of sunshine shaking with the shades of leaves on the ground.

Dean walks deeper into the woods, eyeing around prudently, looking for some evidence of one certain giant feathery creature that is his friend.

Birds fly in and out between the trunks, all the time. Big and small, red and white, chirping and humming. Woodhackers knocking on the bark, hummingbird lingering in the middle of air. Dean pays specific attention to those in black -- though, upon thinking about that, he doesn't really know the color of Cas's wings. He's only shown the shadow after all. He still imagines them shine starry black like the night sky.

Ravens and crows croak and squawk, soaring and gliding.

But none of them are more than a few feet in size. And none of them have a celestial vibe in them.

Maybe legends are just legends, remain the mythology stories as they should be. There is no giant ancient bird, there might never have been. Dean sighs, bitterly, not entirely surprised but still feels the punch in the stomach. He wonders if it's time to admit his defeat in this phantom chase and call it a day.

Hours passed, Dean finds himself still frustratingly circling round and round in the place. All the goddamn trees look exactly the same, tall and straight, featureless and faceless. He can't see a sign or man-made trail. Or any other living breathing human being in sight.

The sun is setting fast. The dull light in the woods in the daytime transitions into darker shades as the sun moves west, and then, the night falls.

The charm and beauty of the woods fade away as soon as the utter darkness takes over. Nocturnal creatures wake up in the sounds of branches cracking and owls hooting. Creatures, perhaps monsters too.

Dean reaches for the blade and flashlight in his pocket automatically, grabbing tight, alerted. This is how the feeling of Deja Vu starts seeping into the reality.

The rustling of trees, the eerie deep calls from above, echoed behind, hanging over him three hundred and sixty degree like a net. Everything so Purgatory-y that for a minute, he does seriously wonder if he somehow misstepped over the portal and has gone back to that nasty place again.

The giveaway is the sounds of tiny small lives. Insects chanting clamorously in the grass, under the layers of fallen leaves and soil. Something small and nimble running and jumping around, climbing along the tree trunks, the sound of their clip-clops finely like rats on the floor, but it's probably squirrels or wild rodents. Purgatory doesn't have that many lives, all it has is monsters with fangs and claws and an appetite for fresh meat.

Dean adjusts his gait, moving gingerly, trained and bridled. The light from the torch reaches no more than a few inches in front of him, before the light is eaten by the blackness and a thin white mist that is swiftly turning into thick dense fog.

And then there are sounds of wings fluttering. Air stirred, forming swirls of winds.

For the tiniest moment, without thinking, Dean is thrilled. Turning around earnestly, he calls "Cas!"

A big black bird crashes into the beam of his flashlight, wings so close to his face that they almost give him a slap. It's startled, flapping the wings hard and shoots past him, flying towards the tree crowns, melting into the darkness of the night.

Dean noticed its crooked beak had a tear of fresh meat, still dripping blood. Must be a vulture, he thinks, enjoying its dinner in the wild wood.

Nothing supernatural, just the wild life, the *natural* rule of food chain. He warns himself. Could be just a dead animal from *natural* death, or the predator that is *also* just a *normal* wild animal killed and ate them.

He points the flashlight upwards, squinting at the blackness, thinking where the bird has gone. The light dims before it reaches the closest tree. Beyond the illuminated range, Dean thinks he sees the shape of some huge dark wings, spreading out across and in between the trees, as big as the story says. He blinks, and the darkness is still just all black, no lines or shapes to see. He shakes his head, distrusting his own eyes.

"Must be wishful thinking." He murmurs quietly, doesn't want to be heard by whatever is out there in the dark.

He walks in the direction where the vulture comes from. The copper smell of blood permeates the air.

Taking in a slow breathe and holding it, Dean flashes the light to the ground. Two human bodies lay there, long dead. Their bodies have become a wild animal bouquet, chest cut open, gut flow out, dragged across the land, leaving bloody trace on the fallen leaves and grass. Their eyes pecked away from the socket, leaving two dark empty spots.

"God damn it!" Dean covers his nose with the hand holding the flashlight, following the bloody trace.

Another swing of black shadow of wings past him, barely out of the light but judging by the shape and size, it's a second vulture.

Then a third.

Then another.

Another dozen.

Another hundred.

Another thousand.

The further ahead he walks, the more he runs into. Wild wings flapping around him like bats disturbed in the cave, the raptors are practically bumping into each other now. Whooshing and wheezing, pecking and jabbing, clutching and scraping, they are like bees from a fallen hive, moths around fire, ducks startled in the ponds, covering all the space in between the woods. They fly around him, then towards him. Beaks and claws attacking, sharp like knives and blades, hard like iron hook.

Something is definitely not right. Dean doesn't watch the Nature Channel as much as Cas, but with the common sense knowledge that he does have about the wild creatures -- plus the few times that he does give up opposing and end up watching them with Cas in the motel -- vultures don't attack living things, and certainly do not travel in this large number of crowd. Scavengers eat leftovers, not looking for fresh takeout, kinda like ghouls.

And how the hell there are suddenly so many of them and so very deadly, and no one ever mentioned.

Dean covers his face with arms, feeling the jacket and shirt on the outer side of his arms and back being ripped quickly, skin torn and pulled, flesh gouged, blood streaming hot. His hand still fastens on the demon blade, but he has no idea what's the good of one blade in the face of a thousand wild human-killing flesh-eating vultures. He doesn't even have a single chance to outrun them. The bloody things have wings.

He did his valid share of research before entering the woods, just to be sure. As much as Dean is eager to come into the place searching, he knows how to do his job, so he comes prepared -- the best he can, just in case the story of the giant bird is something in his expertise and needs to be killed. Bird-like flying thing with wings, it can be angel, but it also can be Harpy (half-human half-bird creature from Greek), Thoth (god of moon with a head of ibis from Egypt), Valravn (magical supernatural big raven from Danish), or a few other options. From what he reads, knives and blades for decapitation should work well enough for most of them, so he walks into this forest of redwoods.

He never thinks it would be this. Nothing really too supernatural, if not counting the number, it's just freaking wild animals. Vultures. Countless of them.

In the frantic sound of wings flapping, in the middle of being devoured and eaten alive, Dean thinks of the bug case all those years ago. The case with Indian curse, the very few case he and Sam never really solved. They helped the family live through the day, wear through the night until the sun rise, and the bugs retreated to where they were. The curse from the native Indians, the nature does the revenge -- they could do absolutely nothing to fight the nature, and he could have died at the age of twenty-six, because of the bugs.

And now, here he is. After the archangels, after the leviathans, and vampires, and werewolves, after all the monsters the Purgatory could come up with and throw on him and he walked out fine and intact, *this* is the thing that gets him finally, and he don't even remotely have any idea how to possibly fight the mother nature.

Dean lowers his body, curling up instinctively, trying to protect his internals. He can barely feel the pain from the places the beaks peck, probably because he might not have much skin left to pass the sense of pain to the brain. He can feel the bloody birds cutting through his flesh like knives on butter, peeling and pulling his skin, gouging and poking his scalp, wrenching and dragging tendons, digging and jabbing as deep as bones.

He doesn't feel pain. He feels hot and warm on the skull, cold and wet on the back. He smells blood and flesh, he hears the sound of his own flesh being pulled away from his body, and there is a vulture flies away with its trophy and the next one comes for their turn of bite.

"I'm going to die." He shut his eyes tight, thinking, miserably. "I'm going to die like an old dog in the wild, eaten clean by some birds, without any bone left. God, no one would even know. Sam might find the car, and Cas... Oh Cas."

Dean feels his chest tight, a sob choked in the throat, hard to breath.

#### Act 3

A loud flutter of wings adds to the sounds of millions of wings crashing and rustling, so loud and strong it distinguishes itself from all the other wings. A strong gust sweep through, sending the vultures that perch on his back with claws digging into spine blown away. The ones pecking his arms lose their grip too, spreading their wings to try to keep some balance. The edge and feathers of the wings brush on the opening wounds, sending his body involuntarily shudder.

The surrounding sounds a lot quieter suddenly. For a second, Dean thinks if it might be his ears suddenly deafened, like a TV turned off the audio all of a sudden. But then he realizes the sound of wings are still there, but further away. The sensation of feathers and wings are still on his skin -- which, looks like he has skin again, on the places that he's sure bleeding like drained pipe mere seconds ago.

The broken bones grow back, the cut tendon connect together, blood flowing through the veins smoothly, the skin feels new and tight. The burning and wet sensation recedes, so does the freezing dumbing sensation. There is only a lingering familiar lukewarm touch on the skin exposed through the torn cloth, a fluff sensation that is barely there.

Dean opens his eyes, lowering his arms. He is surrounded by something warm and huge, wrapping him up like the best natural feathery quilt, covering him from head to toe. No one could ever hurt him from here, no vulture as well. It is dark, but from the flashlight that he dropped on the ground a few inches away, he sees the wings around him isn't pure black. It's glittering tiny little shine of light, like the finest diamond inlayed in between the feathers.

Dean doesn't need anything else to know who it is.

"Cas." He reaches out a hand, can't help himself.

For a blink of time, he imagines there is nothing, just another dying hallucination, just the last warm dream like the Little Match Girl. But his fingertips land on the feathers. Soft on the tip, tender on the middle, strong on the root, disarranged in his touch. He takes a long breathe in, and he smells sky.

"Cas, is that really you? This is your wings?" His voice is still a bit shivering, wet. "So you're -- you're okay. More than okay. The wings, oh God, I never know it looks like this, up close, I mean."

He takes another long drag of broken breathe, feeling his heartbeat finally starting to slow down. Dean murmurs, quietly, "They're so beautiful, Cas. They're amazing."

He puts both palms on the wings in front of him, feeling the warmth that is slightly higher than his own passing onto the hollow of his palms. He might be imagining it, but underneath it, he feels a pulse. A live, pumping, steady pulse, beating in the rhythm of an elephant. He lets the feathers intertwine with his fingers, watching it separate to allow his fingers sinking into the sea of black feather. For this moment, Dean feels safe, even if he knows he must be fast from it.

"This giant ancient bird Artemis told me about, thousands of miles wide and thousands of miles tall, stirring sea and sky, it's you, isn't it?" Dean tries hard to steady his breathe, feeling proud. "I know it! I know it all along."

Cas doesn't answer.

In fact, Cas hasn't said a word or even showed his face, it is only the wings that Dean sees.

Only then does he realize, and start frowning. "Cas, buddy, I want to see you. What happened? Come down here, talk to me."

There is a high-pitched voice in a thunderous volume rolling above his head, piercing through the air. The same kind that blows up the glasses in the gas station shop on the day he crawled out of the grave, back on Earth from the Pit tour. Castiel's true voice.

Dean covers his ear until the voice silences. "You can't speak human now?" He guesses, then adds quickly. "Okay let's do this, knock once for no, knock twice for yes, we'll figure out other things later. Right or wrong, Cas?"

The wing wrapped closest to him moves, pulling away from him, the tip of it knocks on the ground twice.

Dean lets out a relieved chuckle. "Now we're talking. Good to talk to you again, Cas."



#### draft notes

gets spooked, finds another tear of dimension and bloody feather in it (too big). protected by six huge black wings (Cas wants to talk but only in true voice and too loud, breaks glasses, but Dean is sure by now it's Cas), Cas gets pulled away again as the tear closes

[+Cas POV: can't talk, can't stay, self-aware weird shape, watch Dean from the other side, see him hurt and fight to force through to save, weakened by each attempt]

### Chap. 3 (Missouri)

> **Outline:** Dean goes to Missouri, Pamela's seance had witnessed Cas's true form in multidimension then so can Missouri (use feather/coat fabric as medium), Dean gets info hint that Cas's true form and vessel are spliced and he's stuck, swears to find&help him. [+Cas POV: meet with Missouri in seance/spirit dimension, can talk/see, hesitant to come back because not want to continue tear dimension to endanger reality&Dean]

### Chap. 4 (Cthulhu)

> **Outline:** Dean drives around, keeps getting spooky feeling of continuously being watched, hears local legend of Cthulhu (humanoid, huge, tentacle, hundreds of meters tall) in Alaska, sees weird/astonishing aurora lights on sky, drives there. midnight, empty road, tear opens, sees giant Cas manifest in full size right in front of impala, wings+rings with eyes+trench coat, leviathans also come through the tear. Dean shocked/terrified/in awe then busy fighting, giant Cas kills them (easier than normal size but easily tired). Dean&Cas grab a few moments to talk/sync (the physics theory behind), Cas worries his reaction at first, Dean needs time to adjust, sees him for real now, rings with too many eyes, not react/communicate well. Cas sensitive, feel rejected/upset, afraid Dean disgust/fear his true form now, self-aware being monster. Cas gets weaker quickly for staying in this dimension talking for long, fighting against natural order, and with the tear more leviathans coming through. For Dean's safety and Cas's own exhaustion, Cas gets pulled back and tear closes. [both POV, Cas upset, self-aware]

### Chap. 5 (Ritual+reunion)

> **Outline:** Dean's idea (convey through pray): expel him (S04E16 Alastair's spell; separate true form with body) and immediately summon him back (S06E21 angel summoning spell; avoid true form going into heaven), let Cas possess him as vessel temporarily, use his own power fix his vessel's size, jump back into his body. talk through Ouija Board, Cas hesitates for risk of hurting Dean (possession+tear open with monsters coming) and he won't be there protecting him, doesn't mention also afraid of getting expelled and not summoned in time make him end up in Heaven, "might kill himself"
>
> Dean insists trying, ritual works, Cas shares Dean's body but both awake, Cas use mojo to fix vessel (Dean witnesses, amazed, "so this is how it's like, internally" "that sounds so wrong but whatever") and ready to go back into it (Cas all the time quiet), Dean mentally apologize and tell him his true form is awesome before Cas goes back (talk in Dean's brain, both normal: "You really think that?" "Yeah, I do"). Cas leaves Dean's body, vessel remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, problem solved, "Welcome back."
