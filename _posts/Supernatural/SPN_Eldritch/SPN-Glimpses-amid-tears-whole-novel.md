## Draft

### Art prompt

> Castiel leaves purgatory through the portal with Dean, but since Cas is in a vessel without a soul the human portal has unexpected consequences and Castiel is stuck in a spliced form of his true form and human vessel. Cas is stuck between dimensions and keeps fighting to get back to the same plane as Dean, and the process of reappearing creates omens that Dean can trace to find him when he does briefly appear in his giant form.

### Outline

time: October 2012

Dean comes back from purgatory, witnesses Cas get torn apart the moment he pass through the portal and disappears, doesn't know if Cas is killed in the process, determined to find Cas if he's not (self-comfort: maybe he's just pulled away, like angel-banishing spell). Dean goes to find Sam, Sam is living with Amelia happily, Dean decides not pull him out of apple pie life again, goes to hunt/search on his own, actively looks for monster/Leviathan/angel sign

Dean finds case of yeti in snow mountain (Rocky Mountain, Colorado), rumor says bigfoot trace but not bare foot, dress shoe trace, witness says seeing trench coat fabric but must be hallucination, Dean raises hope, starts searching, finds tear of dimension and bloody coat fabric in it (too big), believes Cas is out there (keep feeling being watched). finds actual Yeti escaped from purgatory, Yeti-Troll fights, Dean gets in between and almost gets killed, saved by angelic light but can't see Cas; the grace light weave into tear, sends monsters back and fix the hole, Cas gets pulled away as it closes [+Cas POV: dark, confused, chaotic, stumble foot print in snow, pulled away before manifest]

Dean follows giant monster witness report, rumor says Archaeopteryx (ancient first bird fossil) in place with huge tall trees (Redwood, California). Dean drives there, gets spooked, feels being watched but no one around, thinks he sees shape of giant Cas's wings in night black but disappear in blink (only get a glimpse), thinks he's going crazy, finds another tear of dimension and bloody feather in it (too big). almost gets killed by Greek creature Harpy (half-human half-bird, eat human, decapitation) and gets saved by Cas, protected by six huge black wings (Cas wants to talk but only in true voice and too loud, breaks glasses, but Dean is sure by now it's Cas), Cas gets pulled away again as the tear closes [+Cas POV: can't talk, can't stay, self-aware weird shape, watch Dean from the other side, see him hurt and fight to force through to save, weakened by each attempt]

Dean goes to Missouri, Pamela's seance had witnessed Cas's true form in multidimension then so can Missouri (use feather/coat fabric as medium), Dean gets info hint that Cas's true form and vessel are spliced and he's stuck, swears to find&help him. [+Cas POV: meet with Missouri in seance/spirit dimension, can talk/see, hesitant to come back because not want to continue tear dimension to endanger reality&Dean]

Dean drives around, keeps getting spooky feeling of continuously being watched, hears local legend of Cthulhu (humanoid, huge, tentacle, hundreds of meters tall) in Alaska, sees weird/astonishing aurora lights on sky, drives there. midnight, empty road, tear opens, sees giant Cas manifest in full size right in front of impala, wings+rings with eyes+trench coat, leviathans also come through the tear. Dean shocked/terrified/in awe then busy fighting, giant Cas kills them (easier than normal size but easily tired). Dean&Cas grab a few moments to talk/sync (the physics theory behind), Cas worries his reaction at first, Dean needs time to adjust, sees him for real now, not react/communicate well. Cas sensitive, feel rejected/upset, afraid Dean disgust/fear his true form now, self-aware being monster. Cas gets weaker quickly for staying in this dimension talking for long, fighting against natural order, and with the tear more leviathans coming through. For Dean's safety and Cas's own exhaustion, Cas gets pulled back and tear closes. [both POV, Cas upset, self-aware]

Dean's idea (convey through pray): expel him (S04E16 Alastair's spell; separate true form with body) and immediately summon him back (S06E21 angel summoning spell; avoid true form going into heaven), let Cas possess him as vessel temporarily, use his own power fix his vessel's size, jump back into his body. talk through Ouija Board, Cas hesitates for risk of hurting Dean (possession+tear open with monsters coming) and he won't be there protecting him, doesn't mention also afraid of getting expelled and not summoned in time make him end up in Heaven, "might kill himself"

Dean insists trying, ritual works, Cas shares Dean's body but both awake, Cas use mojo to fix vessel (Dean witnesses, amazed, "so this is how it's like, internally" "that sounds so wrong but whatever") and ready to go back into it (Cas all the time quiet), Dean mentally apologize and tell him his true form is awesome before Cas goes back (talk in Dean's brain, both normal: "You really think that?" "Yeah, I do"). Cas leaves Dean's body, vessel remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, problem solved, "Welcome back."

### Cas's pieces

- trench coat/tie clothing fabric
- wing/feather
- ring/eyes
- light/grace

### Monster inspire/reference

case fic? actually all Cas

- yeti/big foot: only see footprint (~3m)
- Godzilla: biggest ~300m
- Cthulhu: humanoid, tentacles, otherworldly god, hundreds of meters
- Mega-Kaiju: (Pacific Rim) biggest ~100m
- alien, transformer, predator, king kong

real case fic source of monster (stick with basics):

- vampire
- werewolf
- leviathan
- ~~ghost~~
- ~~demon~~

### Theory/physics

Tear of dimension: leave power/energy surge/draining, break wall between spaces, free traveling around between dimensions (≈purgatory exit)

Cas's true form: multidimensional wavelength celestial being, size of Chrysler Building (319m, ~1k feet)

Why giant: true form wavelength gets twisted at the edge of dimension, think of as how light get refracted on different media interface e.g. water-air surface; or quantum physics, wave-particle dualism, wave longer after passing through smaller slit, diffraction effect

Dean: "Cas, English" Cas: "going through portal makes me giant"

Dean: "Who's dragging you away?" Cas: "Law of physics"

Dean: "Are you saying you're here, but the other part of you is still in some wormhole space?"

Cas: "In a manner of speaking, yes"

Dean: "How can I get you back, the whole complete you, not pieces of glimpses here and there" Cas: "I don't know" don't know if it's even possible, or if he really wants given the risks on Dean

Solution: needs to separate true form from vessel, expel him then bound him again, banishing+summoning spell+holy fire circle

### Reference

ominous spooky feeling: ≈P3 Sirius Black bad omen black dog (fearful but fundamentally good-natured, mysterious, suspension)

high dimension: Interstellar (2014, not released yet; current=)

#### Dean's mental state

≈S08E01-07

focus on guilty, heavy self-blame, feel crap for not getting Cas back complete

he can only save Cas if he lets go of some of that blame/guilt

mission mode, focused on saving mission

#### Cas's mental state

≈S08E07-10

focus on self-punishment, torn between dimension and true form & vessel=torn between saving heaven vs earth, choosing angel vs human, go back to purgatory for self-punishment vs go back to earth to help/protect Dean

so every time Cas fights hard to tear through dimension to get to this plane, to protect Dean, he gets more wounded and weaker in celestial part, so the fighting back itself is a step closer to the final decision point and away from torn state, so finally he can get out of the intertwined quantum superposition state, he comes back to Dean once he figure out he can only protect Dean if he forgives himself (more or less), his choice is always Dean more than anything else

**core curve**: Cas needs to really decide on the answer to "What are you, angel or human" (if angel, true form; if human, body) -> but he *is* both

#### Act 1

Dean slams on the gas hard, the stolen car roars in exhaustion, kicking up the dirt along the way. Dean rolls the window down, not caring the dirt flowing in and out. Not like they could make his face any dirtier than he already is. Not like there is any place on Earth can get any dirtier than the place he just came back from.

The night road stretches, ahead, and broad on both sides. Empty. No sight of another human being, not a single passing car. The frogs shout loudly in the bushes along the road.

Dean just stares at the road, and drives. Like it's the only thing he can think of. It's the only thing he can still trust himself to do, without causing any harm.

He drives on the freeway from the 100-miles wilderness in Maine, to west, to south, to anywhere the road leads him to. He drives, so he doesn't need to think, or talk, or eat, or sleep. As if it can just last so long, that all the things he left behind, all the things he just lost, would never catch up.

<br>

They still catch up. Of course they do. The images and sounds and smells of that filthy place. The memory of everything happened in the past year. They catch up to him and roll him over, like a snake coils around his prey before devouring the food in whole when they are still alive. Dean is the food and prey of the anaconda conjured by his own brain, made up of this bitter bloody thing called "memory".

"Dean --" He remembers Cas calling his name. Desperate. His eyes on him. His hands in his. His whole life and trust and everything he carries, all put in the hands they held together. Dean saw them all in Cas's eyes, heard them all in his voice. Dean grasped him tight, and didn't let go.

The palms were slippery with blood and sweat. Every inch of his muscle in arms and backs pained with the stress. Cas's whole weight leaned onto him. And Dean held him tight, just as desperate, like the whole world was on the hands he held, because it might as well is.

And then, it stopped. The weight disappeared. The hands loosened. They stepped over the portal together, Dean fell onto the solid ground of the sweet Earth, and two feet besides him where Cas was, it was just a blast of bright light, and then, there was nothing.

He heard Cas's scream, whether it's his human voice pitching too high or it's his shrieking angel voice, he already couldn't tell. All he saw was the silvery light of Cas's grace exploded in front of him, his last voice broken and painful. He yelled for him for the last time, then he was not there anymore. Nowhere to be found.

Dean yelled the angel's name, he would have torn the reality a hole right then and there if he knew how, just to tear open the portal again, to see if Cas fell back into the Monsterland. He would jump back into the place to get Cas back, he swore, just like he had told him, the bottom line is, they are going home together, and he wouldn't leave if Cas is not here with him.

But promises are empty, swears fall into nothing. He is here, and Castiel is not.

Dean stares hard at the front of the windshield, staring at the road so hard and rigid without blinking that it almost starts making his eyes watery. Cas should be here, by his side, sitting in the shotgun. And they should go home, together.

Dean punches the wheel, swearing and cursing. The first hint of the sunrise emerges from the end of the road, piercing right into his eyes. He blinks in the sudden light, the golden color looks nothing like Castiel's grace but light is light. Dean blinks again, the dried eyes finally condense enough moisture at the corner that threatens to drop.

Dean wipes the eyes with the back of his hands. The wetness mixes with the dirt and dried blood stains that still cover his hands, making a mess. He presses the accelerator pad harder, urging the vehicle forwards, as if he's rushing to a destination where he knows where to go.

"You are not dead, Cas." Dean growls at the empty road ahead of him. "You're not gone, I know that. Just blown away by the portal or something. I'll get you back, Cas, I promise. I can find you in the Purgatory, I'll find you again."

The car rolls ahead in a louder engine moan, speeding on the road that is lightened up by the newborn sun.

<br>

All of Sam's cellphones are  offline, Dean tries every single one that he can remember, but pretty much always empty service or empty number, barely even any having Sam's recorded voice played out, asking for a voicemail. He tries his own old cells too, no difference.

It takes three days to track Sam down again. The patterns and old habits die hard, traces scattered around like bread crumbs. He rolls into the small town of Kermit, Texas, parking in front of the white fence house.

Thin white curtain with laces half covers the room. He glances inside.

Sam stands by a woman, holding her close. The two of them are kissing, gently. The rest of the time, they are just holding each other together, his hands on her shoulder, hers on his waist, as if dancing to an old classic waltz.

The white-fence apple-pie life they had talked about, sometimes dreamed out, never once really believed can be theirs.

Dean drives away, leaving the house in his rearview. They even have flowers with small purple blossoms in the garden, poking out between the fence.

Dean leaves the town after the midnight -- but not before he sneaks into the garage and drives away with his canvas-covered impala. The keys hang by the garage door.

*You get a home now, at least let me have mine.* Dean thinks, wondering for a minute how long it would even take before Sam notices the impala isn't where it was. For a brief moment, he wonders if this is exactly how Sam feels, when he spent time with Lisa right when he came back from the Cage.

He leaves the town under the starry sky, the road empty and vast like it always is these days.
