## Draft

### Art prompt

> Castiel leaves purgatory through the portal with Dean, but since Cas is in a vessel without a soul the human portal has unexpected consequences and Castiel is stuck in a spliced form of his true form and human vessel. Cas is stuck between dimensions and keeps fighting to get back to the same plane as Dean, and the process of reappearing creates omens that Dean can trace to find him when he does briefly appear in his giant form.

### Outline (1st draft)

time: October 2012

Dean comes back from purgatory, witnesses Cas get torn apart the moment he pass through the portal and disappears, doesn't know if Cas is killed in the process, determined to find Cas if he's not (self-comfort: maybe he's just pulled away, like angel-banishing spell). Dean goes to find Sam, Sam is living with Amelia happily, Dean decides not pull him out of apple pie life again, goes to hunt/search on his own, actively looks for monster/Leviathan/angel sign

Dean finds case of yeti in snow mountain (Rocky Mountain, Colorado), rumor says bigfoot trace but not bare foot, dress shoe trace, witness says seeing trench coat fabric but must be hallucination, Dean raises hope, starts searching, finds tear of dimension and bloody coat fabric in it (too big), believes Cas is out there (keep feeling being watched). finds actual Yeti escaped from purgatory, Yeti-Troll fights, Dean gets in between and almost gets killed, saved by angelic light but can't see Cas; the grace light weave into tear, sends monsters back and fix the hole, Cas gets pulled away as it closes [+Cas POV: dark, confused, chaotic, stumble foot print in snow, pulled away before manifest]

Dean follows giant monster witness report, rumor says Archaeopteryx (ancient first bird fossil) in place with huge tall trees (Redwood, California). Dean drives there, gets spooked, feels being watched but no one around, thinks he sees shape of giant Cas's wings in night black but disappear in blink (only get a glimpse), thinks he's going crazy, finds another tear of dimension and bloody feather in it (too big). almost gets killed by Greek creature Harpy (half-human half-bird, eat human, decapitation) and gets saved by Cas, protected by six huge black wings (Cas wants to talk but only in true voice and too loud, breaks glasses, but Dean is sure by now it's Cas), Cas gets pulled away again as the tear closes [+Cas POV: can't talk, can't stay, self-aware weird shape, watch Dean from the other side, see him hurt and fight to force through to save, weakened by each attempt]

Dean goes to Missouri, Pamela's seance had witnessed Cas's true form in multidimension then so can Missouri (use feather/coat fabric as medium), Dean gets info hint that Cas's true form and vessel are spliced and he's stuck, swears to find&help him. [+Cas POV: meet with Missouri in seance/spirit dimension, can talk/see, hesitant to come back because not want to continue tear dimension to endanger reality&Dean]

Dean drives around, keeps getting spooky feeling of continuously being watched, hears local legend of Cthulhu (humanoid, huge, tentacle, hundreds of meters tall) in Alaska, sees weird/astonishing aurora lights on sky, drives there. midnight, empty road, tear opens, sees giant Cas manifest in full size right in front of impala, wings+rings with eyes+trench coat, leviathans also come through the tear. Dean shocked/terrified/in awe then busy fighting, giant Cas kills them (easier than normal size but easily tired). Dean&Cas grab a few moments to talk/sync (the physics theory behind), Cas worries his reaction at first, Dean needs time to adjust, sees him for real now, not react/communicate well. Cas sensitive, feel rejected/upset, afraid Dean disgust/fear his true form now, self-aware being monster. Cas gets weaker quickly for staying in this dimension talking for long, fighting against natural order, and with the tear more leviathans coming through. For Dean's safety and Cas's own exhaustion, Cas gets pulled back and tear closes. [both POV, Cas upset, self-aware]

Dean's idea (convey through pray): expel him (S04E16 Alastair's spell; separate true form with body) and immediately summon him back (S06E21 angel summoning spell; avoid true form going into heaven), let Cas possess him as vessel temporarily, use his own power fix his vessel's size, jump back into his body. talk through Ouija Board, Cas hesitates for risk of hurting Dean (possession+tear open with monsters coming) and he won't be there protecting him, doesn't mention also afraid of getting expelled and not summoned in time make him end up in Heaven, "might kill himself"

Dean insists trying, ritual works, Cas shares Dean's body but both awake, Cas use mojo to fix vessel (Dean witnesses, amazed, "so this is how it's like, internally" "that sounds so wrong but whatever") and ready to go back into it (Cas all the time quiet), Dean mentally apologize and tell him his true form is awesome before Cas goes back (talk in Dean's brain, both normal: "You really think that?" "Yeah, I do"). Cas leaves Dean's body, vessel remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, problem solved, "Welcome back."

### Cas's pieces

- trench coat/tie clothing fabric
- wing/feather
- ring/eyes
- light/grace

### Monster inspire/reference

case fic? actually all Cas

- yeti/big foot: only see footprint (~3m)
- Godzilla: biggest ~300m
- Cthulhu: humanoid, tentacles, otherworldly god, hundreds of meters
- Mega-Kaiju: (Pacific Rim) biggest ~100m
- alien, transformer, predator, king kong

real case fic source of monster (stick with basics):

- vampire
- werewolf
- leviathan
- ~~ghost~~
- ~~demon~~

### Theory/physics

Tear of dimension: leave power/energy surge/draining, break wall between spaces, free traveling around between dimensions (≈purgatory exit)

Cas's true form: multidimensional wavelength celestial being, size of Chrysler Building (319m, ~1k feet)

Why giant: true form wavelength gets twisted at the edge of dimension, think of as how light get refracted on different media interface e.g. water-air surface; or quantum physics, wave-particle duality, wave longer after passing through smaller slit, diffraction effect

Dean: "Cas, English" Cas: "going through portal makes me giant"

Dean: "Who's dragging you away?" Cas: "Law of physics"

Dean: "Are you saying you're here, but the other part of you is still in some wormhole space?"

Cas: "In a manner of speaking, yes"

Dean: "How can I get you back, the whole complete you, not pieces of glimpses here and there" Cas: "I don't know" don't know if it's even possible, or if he really wants given the risks on Dean

Solution: needs to separate true form from vessel, expel him then bound him again, banishing+summoning spell+holy fire circle

(above is conversation during seance by Missouri)

### Reference

ominous spooky feeling: ≈P3 Sirius Black bad omen black dog (fearful but fundamentally good-natured, mysterious, suspension)

high dimension: Interstellar (2014, not released yet; current=)

### Easter Egg

Chap. 2, the legends of the giant fish and bird: quote from 庄周《逍遥游》“北冥有鱼，其名为鲲。鲲之大，不知其几千里也；化而为鸟，其名为鹏。鹏之背，不知其几千里也，怒而飞，其翼若垂天之云。”

Chap. 2, how does Dean know about the names of the trees, plants, creatures and birds: apparently Cas has dragged him to watch Nature channel together more than once, and he actually paid attention. Especially the bird part, he doesn't even realize he has a thing for them until much later and also in here, he realizes he does memorized those things and names he watched, while thinking about Cas's wings. But still, even when they were watching together and when he was definitely thinking about Cas's wings, he never really asked, so he never know Cas's wings true color or there are three pairs of them. (could potentially add an epilogue of watching bird Nature channel together or go back to the Redwood again with Cas guiding and introducing the creatures/plants, and Dean's knowledge surprise Cas too)

### Dean's mental state

≈S08E01-07

focus on guilty, heavy self-blame, feel crap for not getting Cas back complete

he can only save Cas if he lets go of some of that blame/guilt

mission mode, focused on saving mission

### Cas's mental state

≈S08E07-10

focus on self-punishment, torn between dimension and true form & vessel=torn between saving heaven vs earth, choosing angel vs human, go back to purgatory for self-punishment vs go back to earth to help/protect Dean

so every time Cas fights hard to tear through dimension to get to this plane, to protect Dean, he gets more wounded and weaker in celestial part, so the fighting back itself is a step closer to the final decision point and away from torn state, so finally he can get out of the intertwined quantum superposition state, he comes back to Dean once he figure out he can only protect Dean if he forgives himself (more or less), his choice is always Dean more than anything else

**core curve**: Cas needs to really decide on the answer to "What are you, angel or human" (if angel, true form; if human, body) -> but he *is* both

### Edit Notes

(general, especially Chap. 1) memory from Purgatory use past tense, the rest use present tense

(Chap. 1-4, 2-4) Cas's POV, 1st person view to 3rd person view? but maintain Cas's POV

wings flutter -> rustle

(general) change all the bad analogies to the proper ones with references Dean would use, e.g. remove all Disney movies & fairy tales & princesses & Anderson's Little Match Girl, replace with old classic movies & rock bands & western movies

(Chap. 3) Dean has no body but only eyes, "like the one painted on Missouri's round table"

#### Act 1

Dean slams on the gas hard, the stolen car roars in exhaustion, kicking up the dirt along the way. Dean rolls the window down, not caring the dirt flowing in and out. Not like they could make his face any dirtier than he already is. Not like there is any place on Earth can get any dirtier than the place he just came back from.

The night road stretches, ahead, and broad on both sides. Empty. No sight of another human being, not a single passing car. The frogs croak loudly in the fields along the road.

Dean just stares at the road, and drives. Like it's the only thing he can think of. It's the only thing he can still trust himself to do, without breaking anything, or losing anything, again.

He drives on the freeway from the 100-miles wilderness in Maine, to west, to south, to anywhere the road leads him to. He drives, so he doesn't need to think, or talk, or eat, or sleep. As if it can just last so long, that all the things he left behind, all the things he just lost, would never catch up.

<br>

They still catch up. Of course they do. The images and sounds and smells of that filthy place. The memory of everything happened in the past year. They catch up to him and circle him around, like a snake coils around its prey before devouring the food in whole when they are still alive. Dean is the food and prey of the anaconda conjured by his own brain, made up of this bitter bloody thing called "memory".

"Dean --" He remembers Cas calling his name. Desperate. His eyes on him. His hands in his. His whole life and trust and everything he carries, all put in the hands they held together. Dean saw them all in Cas's eyes, heard them all in his voice. Dean grasped him tight, and didn't let go.

The palms were slippery with blood and sweat. Every inch of his muscle in arms and backs screamed in stretched and strain, the stress turns into sharp pain shortly, but he didn't let go. He didn't. Cas's whole weight leaned onto him, depends on him. So Dean held him tight, just as desperate, like the whole world was on the hands he held, because it might as well is.

And then, it stopped. The weight disappeared. The hands loosened. They stepped over the portal together, Dean remembered agonizingly clearly, he fell onto the solid ground of the sweet Earth, and two feet besides him where Cas was, it was just a blast of bright light, and then, there was nothing.

He heard Cas's scream, whether it's his human voice pitching too high or it's his shrieking angel voice, he couldn't tell. All he saw was the silvery light of Cas's grace exploded in front of him, torn apart at the moment of passing. His last voice broken and painful. He yelled for him for the last time, then he was not there anymore. Nowhere to be found.

Cas had mentioned too damn many times they had no idea if the portal would allow an angel to pass, but they agreed to try, together. And they did. But just like every other long shots in their bloody lives -- the bleak hopes, the only plan, they never work.

Dean yelled Cas's name, shouted until throat hoarse. He would have torn the reality a hole right then and there if he knew how, just to tear open the portal again, to see if Cas fell back into the Monsterland. He would jump back into the place to get Cas back, he swore, just like he had told him, the bottom line is, they are going home together, and he wouldn't leave if Cas is not here with him.

But promises are empty, swears fall into nothing. He is here, and Cas is not.

Dean stares hard at the front of the windshield, gazing at the road so hard and rigid without blinking that it starts making his eyes watery. Cas should be here, by his side, sitting in the shotgun. They should come home, together.

Dean punches the wheel, swearing, cursing. The first hint of the sunrise emerges from the end of the road, piercing right into his eyes. He blinks in the sudden light, the golden color looks nothing like Castiel's grace but light is light. Dean blinks again, the dried eyes finally condense enough moisture at the corner that threatens to drop.

Dean wipes his eyes with the back of his hands. The wetness mixes with the dirt and dried blood stains that still cover his hands, making a mess. He presses the accelerator pad harder, urging the vehicle forwards, as if he's rushing to a destination, as if he knows where to go, or where to find Cas.

"You are not dead, Cas." Dean growls at the empty road ahead of him. "You're not gone, I know that. Just blown away by the portal or something. I'll get you back, Cas, I promise. I can find you in the Purgatory, I'll find you again."

The car rolls ahead in a louder engine moan, speeding on the road that is slowly lightened up by the newborn sun.

<br>

All of Sam's cellphones are offline, Dean tries every single one that he can remember, but pretty much always get a robotic voice telling him empty service or empty number, barely even any having Sam's recorded voice played out, asking for a voicemail. He tries his own old cells too, no difference.

It takes three days to track Sam down again. The patterns and old habits die hard, traces scattered around like bread crumbs. He rolls into the small town of Kermit, Texas, parking in front of the white fence house.

Thin white curtain with laces half covers the room. He glances inside.

Sam stands by a woman, holding her close. The two of them are kissing, gently. For the most of the time, they are just holding each other together, his hands on her shoulder, hers on his waist, simply having their foreheads pressed together, breathing each other's breathe, like the way when people dancing to an old classic waltz.

Dean looks like this white-fence apple-pie life they had talked about, sometimes dreamed out, never once really believed can be theirs.

He drives away. Leaving the house in his rearview.

They even have flowers with small purple blossoms in the garden, poking out between the fence, ignorant of the early winter chillness of October.

Dean leaves the town after the midnight -- but not before he sneaks into the garage and drives away in his canvas-covered impala. The keys hang by the garage door.

*You get a home now, at least let me have mine.* Dean thinks when he sits into the familiar driver's seat, reversing onto the road, wondering for a minute how long it would even take before Sam notices the impala isn't where it was. For a brief moment, he wonders if this is exactly how Cas feels, seeing him with Lisa right when he was knee deep in trouble but didn't have the heart to knock on that freshly painted door.

You don't knock on a door like that, not with the hand that can never wash clean from the layered and dried blood stains.

He leaves the town under the starry sky, the road empty and vast like it always is these days.

<br>

#### Act 2

There are still work to do. There are always work, somewhere. Monsters, ghosts, something dark, something evil, something lurking in the dark, waiting to tear people's heart out or drink their blood dry.

Dean is good at finding things in the dark. But this time, he's looking for something in the light. Something bright and glaring, fluffy and feathery, something -- someone -- holy and angelic.

As much as he would say angels are nothing more than monsters with good PR, as many times as Cas has explained he doesn't have a harp, it seems when he thinks of Cas, he still can't help thinking of halos and wings. The same image in his mind until he was four, every night when his mom told him angels were watching over him. So that's what he looks for.

It is starting to grow into a routine. Dean gets into the habit of picking up a piece of newspaper at the breakfast and reading through over the coffee. Then he sits in the cafe for a whole day going through people's mention of angelic encounters online. He scans and scrolls, reads and looks, squints at the words of the witnesses and illustrations from the visionaries, thinking, if any of these is a sign of Cas. If any of them can be luckier than he is, and has a glimpse of Cas while he cannot.

Then he drives, and reads, and asks people around if there is anything weird and holy happening, anything like sudden increased temperature or bright lights and thunderous sound, and orders the paper and coffee. Then he hits the road again.

The days and roads muffled together. Dean distantly realizes he might get as bearded and dirty as he was in Purgatory, and he decides he doesn't care. He punches the word "angel" into the laptop searching bar again.

<br>

There are some pagan gods in Wyoming, some werewolves in Michigan, and then some more pagan gods in Colorado. Dean takes care of them.

He has hoped maybe some of those pagan gods could have enough juice that he can negotiate to use. But at the end of the day, none of them are anything more than a bunch of bloodthirsty sons of bitches. Dean buries the knives into their chests or cuts their heads off, whatever works.

Blood of the gods and creatures splatter onto his face. Dean gets so used to it now he doesn't flinch or blink.

Some of these days, the Earth feels no different from the Purgatory. Full of ugly things, and none of the one he's looking for.

He still prays every night. And he drives on.

By November, he has cleaned a nest of vampires in Washington and killed a nasty spectre in Missouri. The winter is falling onto him quickly. But the coldness is the last thing he would worry.

The first snow catches him when he's in Rocky Mountain, Colorado, thinking of cutting the state in a short cut, when the blizzard almost buries half the car. He stays in a tourist center on the waist of the mountain, stuck with a group of chatty tourists too stupid to travel without checking weather report, staring at the roaring snow outside of the window painting the whole world white and blank. Separated from the rest of the world.

There was no snow in the Purgatory. Or rain. Or sun.

Everything was just grey and bleak, trees half-dead with only trunks standing, ground covered by dirt of corroded skeletons.

So at least, if nothing else, the snow is a good reminder that this is really the Earth. Dean watches the strong wind blowing snowflakes as large as his palm onto the window, then adding layers after layers. The view soon blocked by the thick cover of snow and ice.

"No, I'm telling you, it's true, there are yetis in this mountain. Legends say they only come out in storms like this, feeding on lost hikers. The snow hides their traces too well so they are super difficult to track, but we still manage to take the photos." Some remote chatter reaches his ear. Dean focuses on the bitter coffee in his hands, trying to block out any mention of new monster or legends. He isn't really in a hunting mood right now.

Coldness seeps in from the gaps of the windows.

He hears laughter from the crowd, whatever photo that man is showing around, the rest of the group isn't buying. A young woman's mocking voice is loud enough for him to hear from across the lobby:"This can't possibly be a bigfoot trace, Hector. What do you take us for, idiots? Look at the footprint, it's not even barefoot, might as well be a size-hundred dress shoe. Unless you're saying yetis start wearing suits and dress shoes?" The crowd bursts into laughter.

Dean lowers his head and takes another drink of his coffee that's already getting cold. Cas used to wear dress shoes. It's been a long while seeing him in the suits though, with everything so messed up and he ended up in a hospital gown that even got carried over into the other side of the portal, Dean finds himself missing that suit and funny little reversed tie.

He doesn't realize a tiny little curl starts pulling on the tip of his lips.

It's been too long. The last time they were both themselves, it's like years and years ago. Decades even, so it feels. Before the Purgatory, before the broken Sam, before the Leviathans, or Raphael. Long, long, time ago when he can still straight his ties, and tells Cas he's "also an FBI", only to watch the badge got displayed upside down.

God, how he wished this is still then.

His lips drop entirely. He drinks another sip of the coffee. It's completely cold now.

"If you don't believe the photo, I guess you won't believe what I saw by my own eyes, then." The man that must is Hector insists, voice over the lingering chuckles that haven't died down. "I swear to God, on the day I take the photo, I see a yeti that is so much larger than any in the record. It must be at least sixty feet tall, and the most weird thing is its color. Not like any other white yetis, this one has a beige color, and the back standing so straight, if I don't know any better, I might say it's a giant in a trench coat."

Dean jerks up his head so fast he even startles himself. He jumps to his feet, marching towards the group and grabbing the man by the collar before he even realizes what he's doing. "What did you say?" He scowls right into the man's face.

Hector stutters. "Chill, man. Just some story time. I was telling the ladies the other night when I was on the mountain. Just so happened to see this weird ass yeti."

"The trench coat, what's it like?" Dean shakes his collar, the man is practically raised to his toes like a cat picked up by the neck.

"Are you crazy? I don't know, just a trench coat. I mean, it's probably nothing, lights and reflections or something." Hector protests and pushes at his shoulder.

Dean lets him go. "And you say he's on top of the mountain in a snow storm like this one?"

"*He*?" Hector flattens his wrinkled clothes, laughing, "Yeah, sure, on the highest top, standing by a big pile of fire with cooked human meat, dancing with other female yetis!" The group of tourists burst into a huge outburst of laughter.

Dean turns around, walking straight towards the door.

"Sir, it's too dangerous to go outside in this weather." One of the workers of the place calls after him.

Dean doesn't look back. "I'm going." He says.

<br>

#### Act 3

It's freezing cold outside. In fact, "freezing" is just too weak of a term for this temperature. Any word that can be thought of for this weather has already been blown away by the blizzard and frozen into the ground.

The snow has heaped up and frozen the door of the place. He has to climb out from one of the highest windows near the ceiling. The building is mostly buried in the unprecedented storm -- the most fierce and sudden one that ever hit in all the recorded history, according to those people back in there.

Dean can sense every inch of his skin dropping temperature fast, he might only have minutes, or seconds, before his body is frozen into some ice sculpture. He maybe -- extremely likely -- literally frozen to death, if he's not buried alive first.

But knowing what he knows now, there is no way he would just sit inside and do nothing. He can fight through the Purgatory from one end to the other, certainly he can survive some snow storm in Colorado.

Dean walks into the storm, and starts walking towards the mountaintop, where the rumors hold. The snowflakes are as sharp as angel blades, cutting him bloody, but there is no dripping blood. Even the sliced veins are frozen to closed the minute they're wounded.

He can't see anything, there is nothing other than a whole complete whiteness in front of him, with all kinds of different shades. He pushes one step after another, but can't tell the difference between each step. He wonders if he's really moving up, or just making the same movement in the same place.

The storm gets more fierce when the top is nearer. The trees are getting sparse, the color of the snow darker. Dean widens his eyes to the biggest extend, searching the sky, the ground, the wood, the mountain. Searching the whole world for a glimpse of color that is different from the whiteness. Looking for a footprint or a hint of beige.

"This is suicide, Dean." The voice he's way too familiar with sounds up somewhere close by.

"Cas?" Dean spins around, turning sharp towards the sound.

"Dangerous, reckless, and stupid. You could die here, buried alive, and I'd never find you or your corpse again, you ever thought about that?" Cas's voice scolding.

"What?" Dean stills. Thinking, then tries, "You're not real, aren't you? I'm hallucinating you?"

"Hypothermia could lead to highly realistic hallucination. It's scientifically tested and confirmed already." "Cas" walks out of the storm, standing in front of him. In his clean trench coat and straight suit, blue tie tilted and reversed in the front. Hairs unbelievably disheveled but not moving in the storm wind. Eyes as blue as the deepest sea and highest autumn sky. The view of the Angel-of-the-Lord as he remembered from the first time they met, the look he forever dreamed about among all the other looks that he had.

"Cas." Dean murmurs, reaching out to him, fingers catching nothing but snowflakes. Though the snow doesn't feel cold anymore.

He pulls a sad smile, looking at "Cas" in the eyes. "I've been looking for you, Cas. Promised I'd find you and bring you home. But looks like I can't even keep that promise, I'm sorry."

"Cas" has a smile just as sad as his. "You're dying, Dean." He tells him, something he already knew, and then, "I won't let that happen. I can't."

Dean can't really think straight right now, about the meaning of the sentences. The low temperature makes his brain as sluggish as his hands and feet, working slower by each second, just like the gradually slowing down heart beat sound that he hears of his own.

That is when the view in front of his eyes changes entirely. Dean blinks slowly, can't understand what he's seeing.

It is as if the storm is split into two halves, like a curtain drawing open on the opera stage. To his left and right, snows and blizzards continue, but right in front of him in the middle, a figure as tall as sky emerges, stepping towards him slowly. Each step stomping on the ground, shaking the earth, like the giant from the Jack and Beanstalk story.

Dean wants to step back, wants to look up, wants to speak. There are so many things he wants to do, the instinct is telling him to run away, or to fight, but his body is too frozen to move. So he just stares, feeling the newly risen adrenalin forcing the heart beating faster. His brain struggles to parse the reality and the view.

The figure wears a long trench coat, reaching to his knees, which is taller than the highest tree in their surroundings. Dean looks up, head as high as his frozen neck allows but still can't see the head of the figure, barely reach the skirt of the trench coat sweeping in the storm. He gasps, his sound choked in his throat.

It is Cas. It is undoubtedly Cas. But it is so unlike Cas, not in any form he has ever known. Not in any history or legend. But it is Cas, for sure. He just knows.

Dean would know him from anywhere, in any form. Not just the trench coat, but his existence. The weight of his stare falling on to him even if he can't see his eyes; the heat of concern radiating from his body, almost practically melting the snow and ice surround them. And most of all, who else would ever like this, always comes to him at the moment of dying. Hell is the first time, Green Room the second, Dean has long lost count of how many more are there.

"Cas." This time Dean really is smiling now. Dirt and snow and hint of blood and cuts smudged on his face, making the smallest pull of muscle a pain, but he's smiling now, big and stupidly.

He steps forward, but Cas retracts. There is a thunderous sound rolling from above, as if coming directly from the sky, low and deafening, like the rage of Greek gods befalling on top of the Mount Olympus.

But it's not a voice of rage, nor warning. Dean can't understand the syllable, but if he knows Cas at all -- which he does -- then he'd know, this is his own name. He would have known his own name in every single tongue Cas speaks, and the tone would remain the same.

He takes another step forward, carefully, but Cas's figure takes another step back. One step, and he's a hundred feet away. The blizzard around them starts roaring again, reaching back to the same amount of intensity and fierceness. But closely around Dean, there is still a safe little area of warmth, blocked out from the storm, like a bubble in space, sparkled golden and silver, the color of Cas's grace.

"What's wrong?" Dean manages, sound overshadowed by the blizzard the moment they leave his mouth.

Cas makes another sound, one word, not "Dean", certainly not "Hello".

"No, no, no, no! Cas!" Dean yells, desperately, instinctively, "Wait! Don't! Not 'Goodbye' again! Not so soon! Stay, please!"

Cas turns around, stepping aside. That is when he sees it. A tear in the space behind him, like a big ugly wound of the reality standing vertical, opening up like Sauron's evil eye glaring down at the earth. Grey and black smoke flowing in and out of the edge, like curtains flying in the wind, more ominous than when Hell's Gate is opened. The blizzard starts right from the center of it, and god knows what other things must have come through from that hole.

Cas must be blocking the hole with his own body -- this giant body he has now, however that happened.

"Cas..." Dean hates it he can't do anything, especially when he knows exactly what is going to happen next, the same nightmare that he's been having for ages, after the day of the Cage opening, after Cas walking into the river. The same worst thing he feared every single night at the Purgatory, and it seems, with Cas, it's just gonna keep replaying.

Dean tries running, forcing his frozen legs and body to move, forcing himself to close up the distance between. He runs as fast as he could. And Cas takes one step back, putting another hundred feet between them. Then another.

Cas is right in front of that huge tear of the dimension now. Bright light start leaking out from him, seeping into the opening, weaving onto it like needles and threads fixing a patch on a piece of cloth, closing it bit by bit.

"Please..." Dean begs, so quiet even himself can barely hear it. Cas's figure starts fading, lights dimming, the hole shrinking. But right before it gets completely sewed up by the bright light of grace, a slicker thread of light flies away from the rest, flying towards Dean.

Dean watches it, dizzily, not realizing his eyes are so teary that the light of the grace is all fuzzed and smudged like a piece of soaked art. The thin thread of light fly onto his forehead, touches his skin and immediately sinks into it.

The warmth soaks him from top to bottom, like the best hot water shower he could use at this moment, chasing the last hint of coldness from the snow storm out of his body. The exact same feeling whenever Cas touches him and heals him.

Dean looks up again. At the place where the tear of the space was, it is now a clean smooth stand of sky, and air. There is no nasty thing from other dimension, there is no bright light of needles and threads.

There is no Cas, again. Not even a sign to prove it wasn't a dream. Except for the lingering warmth that still flows in his body.

The killing snow storm has stopped, he realizes belatedly, when the tear is mended, when Cas is gone.

He stares at the sky that is clearing. Blue as crystal.

A piece of fabric, drifts down from the middle of air, slowly flying to the ground, landed on the snow. Beige color, trench coat texture, torn and blood stained.

Dean picks it up, puts it in the chest pocket closest to his heart.

<br>

#### Act 4 (Cas POV)

It is dark.

This place.

It is shredding.

Cutting.

Confusing.

Everything is pieces.

Then they are not.

Floating.

Swimming.

Chaotic.

The dimension in between.

<br>

It takes time, really long time to find the pieces together.

But what is time, when time is not a dimension.

When time, can also be torn apart, like everything else, in this dimension.

Words are difficult to find, with characters and syllables.

Mind and body and grace and existence alike.

Which is the right place, for which piece of puzzle, floating by.

Woven, with the pain and bitter and guilt and penance.

Kneading, into every fabric.

Every fabric of the dimension.

Every fabric of one existence.

Who is building me up this time?

Not God. Me.

I'm putting me together.

But, then, Theseus's Ship,

Who am I?

<br>

It is dark.

Behind the curtain.

Lights are out.

Tear it down.

No,

Tear it open.

The light is on the other side.

<br>

Then,

Snow and cold.

Pain and real.

Torn and broken.

I see you.

<br>

Hello.

I'm sorry.

The lights are out again.

The curtain is drawn back.

Too quick, too short.

Back, dark, torn, away.

Don't cry.

Goodbye.

### Chap. 2 Into the Woods (Birds)

> **Outline:** Dean follows giant monster witness report, rumor says Archaeopteryx (ancient first bird fossil) in place with huge tall trees (Redwood, California). Dean drives there, gets spooked, feels being watched but no one around, thinks he sees shape of giant Cas's wings in night black but disappear in blink (only get a glimpse), thinks he's going crazy, finds another tear of dimension and bloody feather in it (too big). almost gets killed by Greek creature Harpy (half-human half-bird, eat human, decapitation) and gets saved by Cas, protected by six huge black wings (Cas wants to talk but only in true voice and too loud, breaks glasses, but Dean is sure by now it's Cas), Cas gets pulled away again as the tear closes [+Cas POV: can't talk, can't stay, self-aware weird shape, watch Dean from the other side, see him hurt and fight to force through to save, weakened by each attempt]

#### Act 1

He spends two days driving from Colorado to Louisiana, another two days from Louisiana to Michigan.

Dean can't help touching the piece of trench coat fragment in his pocket, as if it's heating up, burning on the skin where his own heart beats. But it's just some clothes.

The leaves of the trees grow wider and larger as he goes south, then thinner and taller again as he heads north.

The laptop search bar has a new frequent search words: "giant monster". It turns out people online tend to report even more witnesses of something huge and monstrous than that of holy or hellish.

Dean picks the roads no one walks or drives, the roads in between trees and deep in the mountains. The mountains where legends say giant monsters and pre-history creature lives.

He runs into a lone vampire making a living hunting bears, and a fairy living in the woods with a goat mask. But not another "yeti" or "bigfoot", certainly no mention at all of any creature with trench coat-colored skin.

The snow starts melting by the road of the Midwest and Lake area. It's been months since Rocky Mountain, even longer since Purgatory. Leviathans fade into memory of a previous life, demons and Apocalypses are like stories that other people tell.

Once, in the middle of the night, on his way driving to Montana, Dean finds himself wondering, if this is gonna be the rest of his life. Drifting on the road, searching, alone, not even hunting, not really. Just looking, finding, going after the angel that he lost.

"Cas, what if the next time I find you is twenty years from now?" He ponders aloud, half speaking to himself half pray, if this can still be called pray. "What if you get pulled away again after that, and the next after is fifty years later. Or a hundred. What then?"

"I might end up in a trench somewhere, one day, become some bones. Then who will continue look for you, bring you home?"

Hours condense in nights like this, moving slowly, minute by minute. Words coagulate. But days and weeks flash by quick.

He has no answer. So he pushes the questions away. He could think of nothing but finding Cas when he was in Purgatory, and it is no different now. Even if it's going to take the rest of his life.

He wasn't planning on coming back to the life on Earth anyway, back there, before he found Cas. Until he found him.

So here, now, on the Earth. It has to be easier. It has to.

The road stretches ahead like used tapes roiling back in a cassette player, miles and miles putting behind the wheels.

Cas is not in Montana, either. But he does run into more gods and such. Zeus and Prometheus die in the same day, and he gets to meet with Artemis, the goddess of his occupation, supposedly the protector of all hunters. It isn't the worst day of his life, all things considered.

That is when Artemis tells him the legend of one giant ancient bird. After he asked nicely.

"There is this giant fish, born in the northern sea, the head to tail stretching thousands of miles long. It turns into a giant bird, no one knows how big it is, must be tens of thousands of miles wide. When it flies, its wings spread like the clouds covering the sky. When the winter stirs the sea, it flies to south. Its wings flap on the water, the sea lifts waves of three thousand miles high. It flies upwards, the swirl of its body creates tornados from ninety thousand miles high in the sky. The wind and air is its breath, the blue in the sky the color of its feathers. Ancient Greek and Chinese all have records of it from thousands of years ago. Is this the giant ancient creature that you're looking for?"

Dean swallows, thinking about the shadow of Castiel's wings on the barn walls the first day they met. "Maybe," he says. "Does this bird has a name?"

"Greeks and Egyptians call it Phoenix, Chinese call it Peng, archeologists call it Archaeopteryx, you're calling it Angel already. Does the name matter?"

Dean shakes his head, dumbly. "And where does it -- he, they -- live and rest? This northern sea it born from and the southern place it flies to, where are they?"

"It only rests on the oldest and tallest tree, thriving from the age of glacier and dinosaurs, taking eight thousand years as spring, and eight thousand more for autumn."

Dean blinks, blankly.

Artemis lets out a short sigh. "Redwood, California."

"Thank you!" Dean blurts out, "Next time, start with that! Now I can see why Greeks have Minotaur and Sphinx."

<br>

#### Act 2

Artemis wasn't kidding when she said the trees were ancient old. Only has a few digits give or take on the specific age.

The foresters say the oldest redwood in the park should be at least two thousand years old.

Dean walks into the woods.

Surrounded by the trees towering over the land, rising into the sky, no human can avoid to be reminded of how tiny they are. Dean is no exception.

He walks among them, awed and uneasy, taking it in slowly. He can't shake the feeling there are stares looking down at him from above -- not in the way like Cas's stares, but in a bad way like spiders monitoring preys. But he doesn't know if it's the trees themselves being too loud and alive, or something else perching on the top. The instinct makes the hairs on the back of his neck stand.

The trunks of the redwoods sheer upwards, chapped and crannied, too thick to be encircled by probably a dozen of grown men. The crowns cover the sky, leaving the space in between gloomy, with only glitters of sunshine shaking with the shades of leaves on the ground.

Dean walks deeper into the woods, eyeing around prudently, looking for some evidence of one certain giant feathery creature that is his friend.

Birds fly in and out between the trunks, all the time. Big and small, red and white, chirping and humming. Woodhackers knocking on the bark, hummingbird lingering in the middle of air. Dean pays specific attention to those in black -- though, upon thinking about that, he doesn't really know the color of Cas's wings. He's only shown the shadow after all. He still imagines them shine starry black like the night sky.

Ravens and crows croak and squawk, soaring and gliding.

But none of them are more than a few feet in size. And none of them have a celestial vibe in them.

Maybe legends are just legends, remain the mythology stories as they should be. There is no giant ancient bird, there might never have been. Dean sighs, bitterly, not entirely surprised but still feels the punch in the stomach. He wonders if it's time to admit his defeat in this phantom chase and call it a day.

Hours passed, Dean finds himself frustratingly circling round and round in the place. All the goddamn trees look exactly the same, tall and straight, featureless and faceless. He can't see a sign or man-made trail. Or any other living breathing human being in sight.

The sun is setting fast. The dull light in the woods in the daytime transitions into darker shades as the sun moves west, and then, the night falls.

The charm and beauty of the woods fade away as soon as the utter darkness takes over. Nocturnal creatures wake up in the sounds of branches cracking and owls hooting. Creatures, perhaps monsters too.

Dean reaches for the blade and flashlight in his pocket automatically, grabbing tight, alerted. This is how the feeling of Deja Vu starts seeping into the reality.

The rustling of trees, the eerie deep calls from above, echoed behind, hanging over him three hundred and sixty degree like a cobweb. Everything so Purgatory-y that for a minute, he does seriously wonder if he somehow misstepped over the portal and has gone back to that nasty place again.

The giveaway is the sounds of tiny small lives. Insects chanting clamorously in the grass, under the thick layers of fallen leaves and soil. Something small and nimble running and jumping around, climbing along the tree trunks, the sound of their clip-clops finely like rats on the floor, but it's probably squirrels or wild rodents. Purgatory doesn't have that many lives, all it has is monsters with fangs and claws and an appetite for fresh meat.

Dean adjusts his gait, moving gingerly, trained and bridled. The light from the torch reaches no more than a few inches in front of him, before the light is eaten by the blackness and a thin white mist that is swiftly turning into thick dense fog.

And then there are sounds of wings fluttering. Air stirred, forming swirls of winds.

For the tiniest moment, without thinking, Dean is thrilled. Turning around earnestly, he calls "Cas!"

A big black bird crashes into the beam of his flashlight, wings so close to his face that they almost give him a slap. It's startled by the light, flapping the wings hard and shoots past him, flying towards the tree crowns, melting into the darkness of the night.

Dean notices its crooked beak had a tear of fresh meat, still dripping blood. Must be a vulture, he thinks, enjoying its dinner in the wild wood.

Nothing supernatural, just the wild life, the *natural* rule of food chain. He warns himself. Could be just a dead animal from *natural* death, or got killed and eaten by a larger predator that is *also* just a *normal* wild animal.

He points the flashlight upwards, squinting at the blackness, thinking where the bird has gone. The light fades into the night before it reaches the closest tree. Beyond the illuminated range, Dean thinks he has a glimpse of the silhouette of some huge dark wings, spreading out across and in between the trees, as huge and wide as the legend says. He blinks, and the darkness is still just all black, no lines or shapes stand out. He shakes his head, distrusting his own eyes.

"Must be wishful thinking." He murmurs quietly, doesn't want to be heard by whatever is out there in the dark.

He walks in the direction where the vulture comes from. The copper smell of blood gradually thickens, slowly permeating the air.

Taking in a slow breathe and holding it, Dean flashes the light to the ground. Two human bodies lay there, long dead. Their bodies have become a wild animal bouquet, chest cut open, gut flow out, dragged across the land, leaving bloody trace on the fallen leaves and grass. Their eyes pecked away from the socket, leaving two dark empty spots.

"God damn it!" Dean covers his nose with the hand holding the flashlight, following the bloody trace.

Another swing of black shadow of wings past him, barely out of the light but judging by the shape and size, it's a second vulture.

Then a third.

Then another.

Another dozen, another hundred, another thousand.

The further ahead he walks, the more he runs into. Wild wings flapping around him like bats disturbed in the cave, those raptors are practically bumping into each other now. Whooshing and wheezing, pecking and jabbing, clutching and scraping, they are like bees from a fallen hive, moths around fire, ducks startled in the ponds, covering all the space in between the woods. They fly around him, then towards him. Beaks and claws start attacking, sharp like knives and blades, hard like iron hook.

Something is definitely not right. Dean doesn't watch the Nature channel as much as Cas, but with the common sense knowledge that he does have about the wild creatures -- plus the few times that he does give up opposing and end up watching them with Cas in the motel -- vultures don't attack living things, and certainly do not travel in this large number of crowd. Scavengers eat leftovers, not looking for fresh takeout, kinda like ghouls.

And how the hell there are suddenly so many of them and so very deadly, and no one ever mentioned.

Dean waves the blade at the few of them getting too close to his face, shooing loudly. But it does nothing, not even remotely scare them. The few ones get caught by his blade flinch away, more immediately fill in their places, coming at him fiercely, claws cutting on his skin, beaks mere inches away from pecking his eyes out.

He covers his face with arms, feeling the jacket and shirt on the outer side of his arms and back being ripped quickly, skin torn and pulled, flesh gouged, blood streaming hot. His hand still fastens on the demon blade, but he has no idea what's the good of one blade in the face of a thousand wild human-killing flesh-eating vultures. He doesn't even have a single chance to outrun them. The bloody things have wings.

Dean did his valid share of research before entering the woods, just to be sure. As much as Dean is eager to come into the place searching, he knows how to do his job, so he came prepared -- the best he can, just in case the story of the giant bird is something in his expertise and needs to be killed. Bird-like flying thing with wings, it can be angel, but it can also be a Harpy (half-human half-bird creature from Greek), or Thoth (god of moon with a head of ibis from Egypt), or Valravn (magical supernatural big raven from Danish), or a few other options. From what he reads, knives and blades for decapitation should work well enough for most of them, aiming the heart for some others. He memorized the incantations for the very few ones that need spell work to cast away. He walks into this forest of redwoods with confidence.

He never thinks it would be this. Nothing really too supernatural, if not counting the number, it's just freaking wild animals. Vultures. Countless of them. *Really should be careful about what you wish for.*

In the frantic sound of wings flapping, in the middle of being devoured and eaten alive, Dean thinks of the bug case all those years ago. The case with Native American curse, the very few case he and Sam never really solved the root cause. They helped the family live through the day, wear through the night; all they could do was to manage not die, to wait out until the sun rises, nothing but to wait for the bugs to retreat on their own back to where they were. The curse from the native Americans, the nature did all the revenge -- they could do absolutely nothing to fight the nature, and he could have died at the age of twenty-six, because of bugs.

And now, here he is. After the archangels, after the leviathans, and vampires, and werewolves, after all the monsters the Purgatory could come up with and throw on him and he walked out fine and intact, *this* is the thing that gets him finally, and he don't even remotely have any idea how to possibly fight the mother nature that throws a thousand vultures on him.

Dean lowers his body, curling up instinctively, trying to protect his internals. He can barely feel the pain from the places the beaks peck, probably because he might not have much skin left to pass the sense of pain to the brain. He can feel those bloody birds cutting through his flesh like knives on butter, peeling and pulling his skin, gouging and poking his scalp, wrenching and dragging tendons, digging and jabbing as deep as bones.

He doesn't feel pain. He only feels hot and warm on the skull, cold and wet on the back. He smells blood and flesh, he hears the sound of his own flesh being pulled away from his body, and there is a vulture flies away with its trophy and the next one comes for their turn of bite.

"I'm going to die." He shuts his eyes tight, thinking, miserably. "I'm going to die like an old dog in the wild, eaten clean by some birds, without any bone left. God, no one would even know. Sam might find the car, and Cas... Oh Cas..."

Dean feels his chest tight, a sob choked in the throat, unable to breath.

#### Act 3 (not break)

A loud flutter of wings adds to the sounds of millions of wings crashing and rustling, so loud and strong it distinguishes itself from all the other wings. A powerful gust sweep through, sending the vultures that perch on his back with claws digging into spine blown away. The ones pecking his arms lose their grip too, spreading their wings to keep some balance. The edge and feathers of the wings brush on the opening wounds, sending his body involuntary shudders.

The surrounding sounds a lot quieter suddenly. For a second, Dean thinks if it might be his ears suddenly deafened, like a TV player muted all of a sudden. But then he realizes the sound of wings are still there, but further away, remote, distant, like behind a closed sound-proof door. The sensation of feathers and wings are still on his skin -- which, looks like he has skin again, on the places that he's sure bleeding like drained pipe mere seconds ago -- warm and soft.

The broken bones start growing back, the cut tendon connecting together, blood flowing through the veins smoothly, the skin feels new and tight. The burning and wet sensation on the spine recedes, so does the freezing dumbing sensation on the back of the head. There is only a lingering familiar lukewarm touch on the skin exposed through the torn cloth, a careful fluffy sensation that is barely there.

It is not the vulture wings that touched him. It is not.

Dean opens his eyes, lowering his arms. He is surrounded by something warm and huge, wrapping him up like the best natural feathery quilt, covering him from head to toe like a cocoon, but with enough space to move too, not confining, but safe. No one could ever hurt him from here, he knows instantly, not vultures, not any monster, not even God or Death themselves, Dean just knows.

It is dark, but through the faint flashlight that he dropped on the ground inches away by his feet, he sees the wings around him isn't pure black. It's glittering tiny little shine of silvery light, like the finest diamonds inlayed in between the feathers. Beautiful.

Dean doesn't need anything else to know who it is.

"Cas." He reaches out a hand, can't help himself.

For a blink of time, he imagines there is nothing, just another dying hallucination, just the last warm dream of the Little Match Girl. But his fingertips land on the feathers. Soft on the tip, tender on the middle, strong on the root, disarranged in his touch. He takes a long breathe in, and he smells sky.

"Cas, is that really you? This is your wings?" His voice is still a bit shivering, wet. "So you're -- you're okay. More than okay. The wings, oh God, I never know it looks like this, up close, I mean."

He takes another long drag of broken breathe, feeling his heartbeat finally start to slow down, his brain dizzy from the adrenaline. Dean murmurs, quietly, "They're so beautiful, Cas. They're amazing."

He puts both palms on the wings in front of him, feeling the warmth that is slightly higher than his own passing onto the hollow of his palms. He might be imagining it, but underneath it, he feels a pulse. A live, pumping, steady pulse, beating in the rhythm of an elephant's heartbeat, the slow pace of a giant creature. He buries his fingers in, letting the feathers intertwine with the fingers, watching them part to allow his fingers sinking deeper into the sea of black feathers. For this moment, Dean feels secure, even if he knows he must be far from it, even if in his whole life, he has never ever been.

"This giant ancient bird Artemis told me about, thousands of miles wide and thousands of miles tall, stirring sea and sky, it's you, isn't it?" Dean tries hard to steady his breathe, feeling proud. "I know it! I know it all along."

Cas doesn't answer.

In fact, Cas hasn't said a word or even showed his face, it is only the wings that Dean sees.

Only then does he realize that, and start frowning. "Cas, buddy, I want to see you. What happened? Come down here, talk to me."

There is a high-pitched voice in a thunderous volume rolling above his head, piercing through the air in answer. The same sound that blew up the glasses in the gas station shop on the day he crawled out of the grave, back on Earth from the Pit tour. Castiel's true voice.

Dean covers his ear until the voice and echo between trees silences. "You can't speak human now?" He guesses, then adds quickly. "Okay let's do this, knock once for no, knock twice for yes, we'll figure out other things later. Right or wrong, Cas? True-voice-only time?"

The wing wrapped closest to him moves, pulling away from him, the tip of it knocks on the ground twice.

Dean lets out a relieved chuckle. "Now we're talking. Good to see you again, Cas." He talks to the black wings in front of him, gesturing vaguely upwards, start feeling weird. "Some part of you, anyway."

He tilts his head, "Hey, what's the deal with this *Amazing Colossal Man* show?"

Dean looks up, but can't seem to look beyond where Cas's wings cover. He can't tell if the blackness over his head is the wing or the night.

The tip of the wing that was responsible to knock on the ground as an answer hesitates. It draws on the ground in a curve, then a point -- a question mark.

Dean can practically hear Cas's voice -- his low grave human voice -- saying "I don't understand that reference" just from that movement.

He can't help feeling a pull at the corner of his mouth. "Anyway, thanks for saving my ass, again. You have any idea what's the matter with those killer birds out there?"

The hesitation again. Dean watches the wing tip shift around like a human wresting fingers in the grill of a difficult question. But then, it taps twice on the ground.

Dean claps his hands together with relief, "Great! Mind show me?"

There is a brief high-pitched growling sound overhead again. Still completely unrecognizable by his human ears, but somehow, Dean thinks, he senses something edgy and pained just from the sound of it. His heart clutches at the feeling of it, even if he has no idea of the meaning.

"Or not, if it's... making you uncomfortable." He tries, regretting the question now.

Slowly, the wrapped layers of wings around him withdraw -- Dean misses them the moment they pull back. From outside to the innermost circle where the feathers slightly brush on his back and shoulders, they unfold. One wing after another.

There are three pairs.

As tall as the redwoods surrounding them, as wide as the opening space allow. From where Dean stands, he can't see from one end to the other, and his human brain can't seen to comprehend the shape in between that hold the wings together. Must be something celestial, he decides, something that is the true Cas.

The wings flap once, three pairs together. A gusty blow of strong wind sweeps across the woods, shaking the trunks and crowns, leaves falling like a downpouring rain, those vultures that were as big as half his height and with wings longer than his arms, just get blown away like small gnats puffed away by a huff, finally leaving a small circle of clearing. But he can hear them steady and ready to fly back any time now.

Cas flaps his wings again. Then a third time.

But even he can't keep doing that forever.

By each flap, his wings shift the direction, blowing the gust into all directions, circling around something.

Something too dark to be made out in the night forest. Dean points the flashlight in that direction, widening his eyes then squinting, looking hard, trying to see what is in there.

Then he sees it. The tear in the space, not too different from the one he saw last time when Cas emerges in the snow storm, but the tear was easier to be noticed in the all white background than the all black one like right now.

But it is the same shape of a wound that tears the reality, an opening leading to somewhere unknown, somewhere probably doesn't belong to any space. The vultures are produced from the opening faster than shooting bullets, flying and dashing out like the annoyest insect in the world.

Judging by the speed of wings' movement, Cas is tiring out fast. He retreats closer to the gap step by step. Dean tries to move towards him.

Cas lowers one of the lowest wings, putting it right in his way, sending the clear enough message of warning him from another step forward. And Dean can see why. There are too many killer birds in the center, if the ones attacking him earlier are giving him a hard time, going any closer could mean being torn apart by the tornado of birds' beak in an instant. Not even Cas can heal him fast enough if that ever happens.

He stays where that wing instructs him to. The feeling of helplessness comes back. The same feeling when he was in that snow storm in  Colorado, the same tightening gut instinct of what is going to happen next as the wings approach the tear closer and closer.

"You're leaving again, aren't you?" Dean asks him, frowning deep, eyes sting. Not expecting any answer. Because they both already know.

The wing tip bends slightly, wrapping around him briefly -- the closest thing to a farewell hug. A feather brushes his face, right where the corner of his eyes is. Dean swallows. There is no tear, he knows there isn't, not now anyway.

His hand reaches up, feeling the touch of the feather, leaning into it.

"Did the Purgatory do this to you? Pulling you here and there? Making these whatever weirdass portals all over? God, I have so many questions." Dean feels the twist in his stomach tightens, the tie turning over. He thinks he's gonna be sick.

His voice quieter. "Do you choose to leave, or do you have to, Cas?" He pushes the words out, tasting the edge of them, each as sharp as the knives and blades and the beaks of those birds, cutting his tongue and throat bloody. "I fight so damn hard, just want you back, want you stay, want you okay. Is that too much to ask?"

The shrieking angelic voice that answers him is even more pained than the previous one he heard. Dean can't imagine what it is that Cas is saying.

The vultures gather back closer as Cas's wings flapping increasingly slower and visibly more exhausted and heavy. One of the creatures land the claws on his wings in the mid sky, more followed. A burst of new smell of copper and iron outburst in the air. A rain of crimson starts falling onto the ground.

Dean yells, "Cas, watch out!" But there is nothing he can do. Some of the birds hovers back, diving in his direction. Feet away, then inches away.

That is when Cas starts glowing. Not too different from last time on the snow mountain, except a lot more intense. Dean shuts his eyes the moment those lights start brightening up, starting from the outline of the wings.

His brain itches to steal a look, to see the wings in light, he imagines it like phoenix reborning in fire (a drastic light show as the legend about that tremendous bird would be like, not the man-like monster back in wild west time), but Cas would definitely be pissed -- pissed at himself, that is -- if Dean gets his eyes burned out because of some stupid curiosity.

The bright light burns the back of his eyelid hot and red, like facing straight at the sun with closed eyes. He waits, feeling the heart pounding loudly in his chest. He listens, the sounds of wings wane and subside, the warm and soft touch of feathers leaves.

Dean opens his eyes when he can't hear any more flutter. His view still stimulates and shakes with a too bright overlay, making the dark scene before him even harder to see. He blinks and rubs his eyes, clearing the water conjuring slowly that must be triggered from the bright light, not because of the breathless slump inside the chest.

There is no scar of space left, there is no giant black wing. No killer man-eating vulture. No Cas.

A crow tentatively croaks, jumping on the grass, then flies away. That is all.

In the place where there was the opening, on the ground, lying on top of the thick coating of fallen leaves, there is a single long feather.

As long as his forearm. As black as the starry sky with glittering light in between. A hint of blood stained the end.

Cas's feather.

Dean's fingers caress the feather, ever so softly, so lightly. Just like the way the wings it belonged to touching his cheek mere moments ago. Ever so gently. The touch of a phantom hand, coming from a distant forgotten dream.

He presses the feather onto his lips, then puts it next to the piece of trench coat fabric. His heart beats a skin's distance away.

<br>

#### Act 4 (Cas POV)

The dimension in between is -- for lack of a better word -- confusing. It's kaleidoscopical, it's a meat grinder of light and darkness and everything in between, a blender of color and shape, a garbage disposal of mind and body.

Starting with the darkness, then the lights from other dimensions start flashing in, like stars from other side of the curtain, then brighter than sunshine.

It takes I-don't-know-how-long to find the words and thoughts again, find the pieces that belonged to me and put them together. It takes longer to see the lights, see them glowing and shining, and even longer to realize what they are.

Prayers can't reach this dimension, yearnings do. The stronger the emotion, the brighter the lights. It starts with sparkles, brightness of comets, on and off, flickering, blinking, flying by; then that of Mercury and Venus, as they're seen from Earth; soon as anchoring and pointy as Polaris in Ursa Minor, as bright and consistent as Orion and Perseus; until, it is supernova explosion.

There is a similarity between here and the deep space in the more familiar dimension.

It feels familiar. It feels home.

It takes a while, but the realization finally dawns: Why are the lights so bright, so calling, so intense that I want nothing but staring into it, going after it, merging into it -- because it is beacon, sent by the one human being that anchors my existence, shines the way back. It is Dean, calling for me.

<br>

The divide that separates the dimensions, is near impossible to tear. It is no cotton fabric of a curtain, it is as steely as a diamond wall hundreds of thousands of miles thick, if its thickness is not infinity.

There is no way through -- none that I can manage by myself.

But I'm not doing it by myself.

I can't hear him, can't really see clear enough of his whereabouts, but the light of emotion radiated from him, directly coming from the beating heart, that is all I ever need.

When the light bursts so bright and desperate, it changes colors, it shines red and bloody, like a wound of this place. Like the bleeding mark on the chest of a thorn bird, sound of a sonorous melody echoes, when it sings its last song as the sharpest thorn piercing through its heart. The power and intensity so strong and insistent, it can cut through everything.

It cuts the divide thin, I push it through. There he is, Dean. But dying. Almost always, dying. Even more so, when I'm around.

More so, when the tear is open, and dangers seep through.

I watch myself, stepping over the tear. Hands, feet, cloths; wings, rings, eyes. The vessel, the angel, the monster, the bad luck. Nowadays, it seems, I'm always the combination of all of these. The eye of the disaster storm, the reason why Dean is in danger.

"I'm here now." I want to say. The sound comes out harsh and sharp, too loud for human. Dean's hands cover his ears. I'm hurting him again. It seems, I'm always hurting him, one way or another.

I mute my own sound, ignoring the chanting deep within, repeating Dean's name. Ache. It doesn't matter. I don't matter. It should be about Dean. It's always all about Dean.

"Stay." I hear him say. Half hear from words, half through prayer, reaching deep into my core.

"I need you." I hear him think. Don't need to invade his mind, the thoughts are already loud enough.

"What do you need me for, Dean?" I wonder. I heal him. I help him on his feet. I wipe his tears.

I put my wings around him, leaning into the warmth of the human body. Greedily. Selfishly.

Taking in his whole existence, grasping the memory, getting prepared.

"I miss you too." I'm thinking. Never told him, never going to.

"I'm sorry." I see blood. Then I see tears.

I see danger. And I see pain. The bright light in his soul, never more blinding.

Why is the word "tear" both the sad salty sea water, and the broken wound that never really heals? Because they're, really, the very same thing.

I see the way out, and I see the way to keep Dean safe. The crossroads.

Think carefully, choose wisely.

It is an easy one, really.

Me, or him.

It is never a decision that needs ponder.

Stepping aside, stepping back.

Wound of the dimension, fixed by body of broken -- sounds poetically fair. And perfect for a penance.

I'm back where I was. The tearing, confusing place. The dimension in between.

I still hear the crying, his calling.

And beats of his heart.

### Chap. 3 Amid the Tears (Missouri)

> **Outline:** Dean goes to Missouri, Pamela's seance had witnessed Cas's true form in multidimension then so can Missouri (use feather&coat fabric as medium), Dean gets info/theory that Cas's true form and vessel are spliced and he's stuck, swears to find&help him.
>
> (Cas's POV: meet with Missouri in seance, Dean's spirit into the same dimension, can talk/see, hesitant to come back because not want to continue tear dimension to endanger reality & hurt Dean)
>
> Dean's solution: needs to separate Cas's true form from vessel, expel him then bound him again, banishing+summoning spell+holy fire circle
>
> first step: needs find Cas in real world again

#### Act 1

Dean parks the car by the road side, sitting behind the wheel for a moment too long, chewing on the words he might need later. The yard with fence and the painted house look the same as the last time he saw them, years ago.

He checks through the curtained window, wondering if the owner is in the house now.

He raises a hand, the front door opens before he reaches it.

"Dean Winchester." The woman regards him, a small smile showing.

"Missouri." Dean returns the smile, leaning in to give her a hug.

"It's been so long." Her hands pat his back gently, then pull away. Her eyes are sharp and pointed, but now covered with a knowing, compassionate look. "I'm sorry about the angel."

Dean raises his eyebrows.

"You're just thinking about him," Missouri eases into the room, leading him in. "In fact, I think that is all that you can think about. Am I right?"

Dean swallows, lowering his eyes to the floor, letting his foot lead himself through the place automatically. "Yeah, uh, yeah, he's the reason why I... Sorry I didn't visit earlier."

Missouri puts a cup of coffee in front of him.

"Eight years isn't short time, but I understand." She says, sitting on the couch at the opposite side across the small coffee table. "Your father sit at that very spot right after that fire, and I told him what he needed to know. How can I help you, Dean?"

Dean's mind wavers for a second by that, old memories of his Dad and Mom and the haunted old house flood back in, but he gives a long exhale and pushes them down. "Cas is not dead," he says, defensive. Not like Mom. And he's not his Dad. "I just need some help to bring him back, that's all."

Missouri nods once, silent, eyes hinting him to continue.

"There was an old friend a few years ago, a really good real-deal psychic." Dean remembers Pamela's bright flirtatious smiles, then the burned-out eye sockets, then bleeding stab wounds in the stomach. He has to force a flinch down. "That was way before we know anything about angels, and she set up this seance, demanding Cas to show his face. It didn't end well," he swallows again, "but it worked, I think Cas actually showed up and talked to her in some psychic spiritual dimension."

"And you're wondering if I can do something similar and let you talk to Castiel in the same way." Missouri finishes the thought for him.

Dean nods quietly, "Can you do that?" He tries hard to not let the desperation and hope seeping all over in his voice, but Missouri probably knows them all.

She considers, eyes searching his face. And whatever she finds there, it seems to satisfy a question she didn't ask.

"Yes, I suppose." She says, Dean lets out a long breath. "There will be risks, but it is doable. It would be easier if there is something I can use as a medium."

"Medium?" Dean echoes.

"Things from the angel. Things he can identify as his, guiding his way to the call." Missouri explains.

That rings a bell. Dean automatically touches the handprint on his left shoulder across the jacket, knowing the red mark is still there. Back then, that mark was all they had that has a direct link with the angel, but now, he has more.

Dean reaches into his inner chest pocket, putting the piece of trench coat fabric and blood stained black feather on the table between them, fingers lingering at the edge of the feather, not leaving. Both of them still have the same temperature from his body warmth.

"I have these." He tells Missouri. "Cas left them behind when, emm, last two times we saw each other, right before he disappeared. Would they work?"

Missouri reaches out to touch the cloth, Dean's fingers twitch involuntarily like he has the strongest urge to take it back, to not allow anyone but himself to touch it, to even see it, but he holds the hands where they should be.

"I believe so." Missouri stands up from the couch. Dean follows the action without thinking. The woman eyes his eagerness. "A seance requires certain preparations, I would have said I'd let you know when it's ready, but I think you couldn't stand just sitting here drinking your coffee, so might as well come over and help set it up."

"Yes, Ma'am." Dean nods appreciatedly.

They use the round dining table for the work, Dean watches Missouri paints a pentagon that covers the whole surface, then Enochian symbols and some loosely familiar marks on four ends, with the last end a painted opening eye. Dean looks at it, having a weird feeling that it's looking back at him.

"What do those symbols mean?" He can't help asking. Call it occupational habit.

Missouri lights up five candles in the center matching each corner while answering. "The air, the earth, the fire, the water. All the basic elements. And this is your door." She points at the eye. "The seance is actually quite simple, the difficult part is to find him and talk to him, if he is willing to show."

"That reminds me, the accident last time, Cas's true form burned that friend of mine's eyes out." Dean admits, a little guiltily, looking at the symbol of the eye again, remembering Pamela's scream and the fire bursting out of her sockets. "Probably don't look at him directly then."

But still, somehow, his mind wanders afar, wondering what it is that Pamela really saw -- a figure as tall as the Chrysler Building like Cas once so casually slipped? A light as bright and burning hot as the sun which is why no human should face him directly? If there has to have one good thing from that blindness, he hopes Pamela at least had the chance to see the most bright and beautiful thing in the whole universe before losing the sight.

"Good to know." Missouri replies, tone flat, "But I'm not going to be the one looking, you are."

"What?"

"I believe he would be more willing to come and talk to you than me." Missouri states, matter-of-fact. "I'll lead the way, and you can have some catch-up."

"How does it work? Some kind of out-of-body spirit-walking experience?" Dean frowns.

"Only your mind will travel." Missouri answers briefly, as if it is enough to understand how the psychics work.

They sit by the table, holding hands. Dean takes the seat right in front of the painted eye. The trench coat fragment in their held hands on Dean's left side, the feather on right.

Missouri closes her eyes. Dean looks at the candle lights briefly until it leaves a jumping flame burn in his view, he closes his eyes as well.

"Castiel, come to us before this circle." Missouri starts, voice slow and steady. "Dean Winchester requests your appearance."

Dean's heart skips a beat at the mention of his own full name. He stares at the blackness behind the eyelid, thinking hard: *Cas, come on. I'm here, where are you?*

Missouri repeats the chanting. Dean prays alongside her voice, as if it's a chanting of his own.

"Castiel, come to us before this circle."

*Cas, come to me, please.*

"Dean Winchester requests your appearance."

*Talk to me, what happened.*

"Castiel, come to us."

*I need you. Please.*

The candle lights in the center of the table start flickering violently. A high-pitch sound starts quiet and distant, increases its volume rapidly as if the source is approaching, is flying closer. The air vibrates with electricity. Light bulbs nearby explodes. The table shakes violently.

Dean holds his breath.

<br>

#### Act 2 (Cas POV → duo POV)

Blinks of shallow lights flash by then disappear like comets. Clouds of lights expand and shrink like nebulas. Clusters of lights form and dissipate like constellations.

Castiel stands in the dimension in between, floating, as if he's in the deep space. Stars and sparkles, here and there. He views the crowds of lights from one cluster to another, checking their brightness, the warmth, the color. Guessing, wondering.

His eyes sad, but not devasted. Longing, but he stays where he stands. Just looking, always looking. Looking at the lights like looking at the way home but he cannot go. Staring, as if they are the eyes of the person he has profound bond with but he cannot follow. Standing still, like a stone sculpture of guardian angel which he once so deeply believed he was, he still wishes to believe.

One flicker of light from the distance starts brightening up quick, catching his attention.

Cas looks up from where he is, wondering what that time and space would be. The intensity keeps growing, the praying and the yearning behind must be aggregating, Cas starts worrying. Dean prays the hardest when he's in great danger.

Cas starts moving toward the light.

It only glows stronger as he approaches, as if it senses him and reacts frantically. The closer he gets, the clearer it shows. With its color, its shape, and all the emotions of the human behind that light of yearning.

The light is dazzling green now. The color of emerald, of deepest forest, of bottled absinthe. The color of Dean's eyes. All too familiar. Irresistible.

And then, his voice comes through, like a phone line with bad signal, the sound is cut, on and off, but it's Dean's for certain, mixed with a woman's magical chanting, forming a power of pull.

"Come to me." He hears Dean's prayer. Near begging. Like every night when they were in the Purgatory. Back then, he would say, "I'll find you" and "We'll go home together".

Castiel feels his heart clutching in the desperate desire to reply. He wants nothing more than tracing the source of the sound, going to him, seeing his smile, embracing him with arms around his back, tight, feeling the warmth and solid. But he can't. He can't.

He had leviathans on his tails back then. And now, the cracks when he crosses the border, it seems they always tear the space apart and keep leaking dangers and evil into the world, with Dean at the forefront. He barely managed to protect him and stop the damage last two times, he doesn't know if he can do it again, or if he wants.

The thought of bringing monsters to him. The thought of his own very existence being close to Dean would bring him more danger is a torture near unbearable. But in the face of Dean's safety, everything else could wait. Everything bubbling and stretching and screaming inside his own chest, asking for his own mind's permission, could wait.

Castiel stops himself when he's a few steps away from that bright light. Listening to the voices, holding himself, forcing himself to not move ahead another step. Because if he does, he wouldn't be able to pause at the next step, or the next.

Dean's voice echoes in the dimension.

"Cas." He's calling.

Castiel closes his eyes.

Sinking into the voice. Forcing his body still. Breathing out long and shakily.

<br>

The blackness behind his eyelid is not pure black anymore, it seems. As the table and the candle lights shake harder, there are glitters of sparks shining inside the black curtain like summer night's fireflies, like splashed sparks after a gunshot.

Dean stares at them hard, widening and squinting his eyes while his eyelids are still closed. He sees the lights moving, wondering if it's his own imagination or the candle lights somehow grow strong enough that it's burning through his eyelids.

Or, is it the mysterious psychic's dimension that Missouri said she could bring him with, where he should go ahead looking for Cas?

He feels light and heavy at the same time. His vision blurred and cleared. He's not sure if his eyes are open or closed anymore.

Dean glances down at himself. There is no body, nothing to control to navigate around the space, only the view ahead. Like a lazy-designed first person view video game.

All he can do is looking, and thinking.

So he thinks hard: "Cas." He focuses on the syllables, imagining how his own tongue and throat would produce the sound, delivering the name.

"Cas --"

"Cas!"

He repeats the name over and over, yelling in his mind like rescue team searching for a lost traveler in the deep wild mountains, wondering if there is any chance the seance could really work, that Cas is really here and can hear him.

The high-pitched voice he heard in Missouri's room earlier sounds muffled now, quieter, lower. Gradually, more human, more recognizable.

Until, he hears Cas's words.

"Dean." Cas is answering his call. But he can't pin his sound.

"Where are you?" Dean can't help glancing around. But the closer he looks, the more confusing he gets. His brain can't make sense of the shapes and figures his eyes received, light and shade shift like looking through kaleidoscope. He catches sight of a blue loose thread, a button, a feather, then something seemingly metal. Then an eye, floating, blinking, staring at him, not connected to a body. Blue.

What is this, space dumpster in some horror movie? *Interstellar* but B-rated version? Dean muses, more taken aback than dread.

"This is the dimension in between other dimensions." Cas answers him, his voice comes from all over, echoing in the space that doesn't seem to have a boundary.

Dean tries to move his eyes around, looking for him, but the view only makes his mind dizzy.

"Don't look back, please." Cas's voice turns into an anxious warning, coming from behind him. Dean doesn't have a body to turn around. He can't see him, but somehow, he thinks, he can sense that weight of existence looming over. Like the weight of wings are wrapped around him. And he knows instantly, with one hundred percent certainty, it is Cas, right there behind him, just out of his view.

"You shouldn't come any closer, you shouldn't even come here at all, Dean." Cas's voice tired and uneasy, over the back of his head. "My form here can hurt you, just by existing in the same plane. I don't want to make the same mistake as the one with Pamela Barnes again."

Dean gives a silent sigh, has to settle with the voice-only facetime. "How are you, Cas?"

"Fine." Cas answers plainly.

Dean manages to deliver the expression of "raising his eyebrows" through the thought. *Of course.*

"You've been here the whole time? After the Purgatory?"

"Most of the times that I can remember, yes. I don't remember the times at the beginning when the portal tears my mind apart, along with everything else." Cas tells him, his voice stable, but Dean knows the undercurrents he heard from the voice isn't his imagination.

"I'm sorry." Dean finds the words coming through the mind easily.

"It's not your fault." Cas says quickly. "You wouldn't have known the portal would do that."

"How bad is it?"

Cas hesitates. The silence stretches, Dean's nerves get tense, "Cas? You still there?"

"Yes." Cas answers from behind him, somewhere high.

"So? How bad?"

Cas sighs, sounds resigned. "The portal only works to send pure humans out, so I think it tries to parse out the human part of me to throw out, and keep the rest behind. So my human body, the vessel, and my essence in the true form, they are shattered --"

Dean's breath hitches.

Cas continues, "Every sense of me are in pieces earlier, at the beginning, it's even more difficult than --" He pauses briefly there, as if trying to decide whether he wants to tell the whole story, then he's decided. "-- more difficult than the time when I took over Sam's madness, and had to rebuild everything in my head."

"Cas..." Dean starts, but doesn't know what to say after that, doesn't know if there is any word existed in the world that could mean anything here, or could express the clutching, squeezing feeling that is growing in him.

"But it's already a lot better now, if it's any comfort." Cas makes his voice light, Dean only tastes bitter from the words.

The blue thread is from the tie, the button from the shirt, the feather from the wings, the eye from the body. The things he saw in this space earlier suddenly make sense now.

Bits and pieces. All Cas's. All shattered. God knows how many more are not even visible.

"Cas," Dean grits his teeth, asking, slowly, "the human part and angel part... It's not just talking about the body and the wings, isn't it?"

The emotions and feelings and doubts, those are definitely things human minds tend to produce. And then there must be some memories and knowledge only belongs to angel. Then separating them apart would mean...

"It is not." Cas says gloomily, "But it's okay --"

"No, it's not." Dean cuts his words off. "Cas, damn it, stop saying you're okay when you're not. But we're in this together, alright? I promised I'd get you home, so I will. Getting your ass out of Purgatory didn't turn out well, let's just fix whatever this shitty dimension's problem is, and get over it. But I can't help if I don't know where to start. Why don't you give me a 101 go-over on the multidimension thing, and we'll see how to fix the problem? What do you say, Angel?"

There is a sound of cloth and wings rustling behind him. Dean has a surge of urge to look around at Cas, looking him in the eyes to see him nod, even if it would burn his eyes out. And right then, he hears Cas murmuring "Okay". Dean breathes out, echoing a same, long, relieved "Okay".

Cas starts: "My true form is a multidimensional wavelength celestial being, not bound to the Earth, while my body is made of atomic vibration and electron cloud in the material plane. Think of it as the Wave-Particle Duality in the quantum physics you humans discovered a hundred years ago. I believe I'm currently suffering from the *Refraction and Diffraction Effect*. And the boundary of this dimension has *Infinity Mirror Effect* when it interacts with any other dimensions. There are wave functions to better explain --"

"Jesus, Cas, aim lower!" Dean rolls his eyes as if they are standing face to face talking in their usual forms. "I said 101, not top advanced high confidential science lecture. I dropped out of high school, for Christ sake. Any chance I can get that in English again?"

"Going through the human portal, it affects me in all forms. It tears me apart, splices my true form with the vessel, makes me stuck in the dimension in between the planes, deforms me to be giant."

Dean winces, remembering the huge trench coat shape against the snow storm and the wings spreading so wide he can't see the edge taking over all the spaces in the redwoods. *Giant, no kidding. He hasn't got a single full-body shot of Cas ever since Purgatory.*

"What's dragging you away?" He remembers the openings in the mid-air, the edge like a wound of the space; remembers Cas stepping towards it, towards the eye of the tornado where the deadliest things come through most fiercely; then his grace weaves into the tear, gone from the sight. Leaving Dean alone, shaking, with nothing but exhaustion and bitter.

"Law of physics?" Cas offers.

There is no visible deadbeat badass being in this space, now that they have been here, so long, talking. No other evil beings cutting them off, no one (hopefully) listening in. No one running the place except for the natural order. *Huh.*

The easiest and toughest rule to break, then.

"Cas," Dean steadies his spinning thought, asking the most important question, the only question echoing in his mind every day and night since Purgatory, since before that. "How can I get you back? The whole, complete, normal, you. Not bits and pieces of glimpses here and there." *Not broken, not crazy, not amnesia. Just, Cas.*

Cas falls quiet. After a long while, his voice finally echoes on top of Dean's head again: "I don't know."

*Don't know if it's possible, if they can find a way, or don't know if he really wants to come back?* Dean decides not to ask.

He tells him this, instead: "I'll think of something. We'll figure it out. We always do. Hang in there tight, Cas, I get you."

<br>

#### Appendix: About the Theory

The theoretical explanations that Dean cuts off but Cas would have explained, if anyone is curious:

**Refraction**: Think of when you poke a finger into a glass of water and look from the side, the finger looks bended and twisted. It's caused by the different materials being different medium for the light, and they have different speeds of light, thus different wavelengths. It's the same when the angel's true form wavelength passes through the boundary between two dimensions: each dimension is a different media, with unique property and speed for wave to pass. The wavelength gets changed and twisted, that's why Cas's figure becomes stretched and enlarged to a deformed shape.

**Diffraction**: The quantum mechanics effect that if a microcosmic particle passes through a slit that as in the similar order of magnitudes with the particle size, the particle would diffract into uncertain location (*Uncertainty Principle*) with a mathematical distribution of likelihood where it may end up to. The smaller the slit, the larger range it could potentially end up with. The tear in the space is of similar size of Cas considering the wavelength, so Cas suffers from the Diffraction Effect, that's why he could potentially end up anywhere with no control of where he would land, only with a statistical likelihood to estimate.

**Infinity Mirror Effect**: If an item is positioned in between two perfectly aligned parallel mirrors, then there will be infinite reflections of the same item inside the mirrors. This is to explain why in the first two chapters, the cases are the strongest snow storm ever and the infinite number of vultures. The items that end up in between the dimension and get infinitely reflected are the most normal, natural things -- one snow flake, and one harmless vulture. But duplicate them by infinity (each of them identical), it would definitely become a disaster. For the story's purpose, also twisted them a little to make them extremely deadly.

**Wave-Matter Duality**: Angel's true form is a type of wavelength, the human vessel is a physical matter, therefore according to classical physics, there can be some contradiction sometimes. But according to quantum physics, there is Wave-Matter Duality to unify them: every matter is a wave, only differs in the length of the wave and frequency of the matter. Therefore in a sense, the human body is also a wave with limited wavelength, that explains why angel can reside into the body and occupies and moves around in it. Also explains why Jimmy said having an angel inside is like flying with a comet -- the short wavelength of human matter has a difficult time catching up with long wavelength angels.

And if we do the reverse calculation, it would mean angel's size as a physical matter would be extremely small according to the long wavelength. That is why angel has to possess human to walk the Earth, otherwise they would simply be too small to be seen.

Taking all that into consideration, it means when Cas said his true form size is as big as the Chrysler Building, that would be referring to his wavelength. Now it's a calculation problem, a wave with a wavelength of about three hundred meters long, it means the frequency is 1MHz, that falls within the range of Medium Frequency (MF) for things like AM radio broadcastings, coast guards, no wonder he can tune in to police radio as well.

Using *de Broglie's equation*, to have this wavelength, it would mean a proton moving at a $10^{-9}$ m/s or an electron moving at $10^{-6}$ m/s. So if Cas doesn't occupy a body and manifest as a physical existence on the Earth, he would have to be extremely small or extremely slow. Angel or not, he's bounded by the rule of physics.

### Chap. 4 At the World's End (aurora lights)

> **Outline:** Dean drives around, keeps getting spooky feeling of continuously being watched, hears local legend of Cthulhu (otherworldly god-like, humanoid, huge, tentacle, incomprehensible, hundreds of meters tall) in Alaska, sees weird/astonishing aurora lights on sky (abnormalcy is massive light & color in sky, beautiful, astonishing), drives there. midnight, empty road, tear opens, sees giant Cas manifest in full size right in front of impala, wings+rings with eyes+trench coat. Dean shocked/terrified/in awe.
>
> Dean&Cas grab a few moments to talk, Cas worries his reaction at first, Dean needs time to adjust, sees him for real now, rings with too many eyes, not react/communicate well. Cas sensitive, feel rejected/upset, afraid Dean disgust/fear his true form now, self-aware being monster. Cas gets weaker quickly for staying in this dimension talking for long, fighting against natural order, and with the tear more twisted light & colors, affecting/endanger the sky/air now, increased electricity/magnetism. For Dean's safety and Cas's own exhaustion, Cas almost gets pulled back again (almost give up fighting), Dean starts ritual before tear closes. [both POV, Cas upset, self-aware]

#### Act 1

Dean spends that night at Missouri's place, then he bids her goodbye first thing in the morning.

The psychic scrutinizes his face, asking in a caring, motherly voice, "What are you going to do?"

Dean dodges her eyes, hating the pity in it. "What I always do, drive around, look for signs, look for him. I'll come up with something."

"Think you'll be alright?" Missouri opens the front door for him.

"Ain't I always?" Dean manages to put a dangling smile on the lips, leaning in to give her a thankful farewell hug.

He leaves Lawrence, Kansas miles behind him when the sun rises.

<br>

Life continues more or less the same, roads and bad diner food and cold coffee, nights and dreams and nightmares. Alone, with the Baby being the only company.

Dean crashes a few hours of sleep once in a while, usually wakes in a start and sweat streaming down the spine. He finds it difficult to tell apart the blackness from the night sky and the memory of that splitting dimension in between he went in during the seance. He would just continue driving, to let the cold night wind dry the wetness on his skin and corner of his eyes. Soon, the night wind is not even cold anymore, he doesn't notice since when the spring is already around the corner.

He still runs into cases, now that not only searching for witnesses of angels and giant creatures, but also extreme natural disasters and weird behaviors of wild animals. He finds a nest of vampires at the report of unprecedentedly wild giant bats, and ghosts of a whole family at the place where locals say the fog is always too thick and cold. Most of the times, they are just pranks and fake reports and actual natural events, he drives to the said locations anyway, just to be sure.

A victim reports in Kansas catches his eyes somewhere around April, the keyword "blue handprint" and "internal organs liquified" poking at his nerves. His reasonable mind knows it can't be angels, can't be Cas, if anything. But there is no way when the word "blue" (just like Cas's eyes) and "handprint" (just like the one marked on his shoulder) are put together and he would let it slip away.

Dean drives into the town of Topeka, Kansas two hours later.

The coroner is not the most collaborative person to work with, and getting caught in the middle of the night in the coroner's office searching empty cases where the bodies should have been is certainly not helping his luck.

The djinn blinks her eyes blue while he gets tied hand behind body on a chair. That flashing electrical blue is the last thing he sees before sinking into the view of Purgatory.

Dean snaps open his eyes, finding himself taking a nap by a tree stump. The sky, the ground, the tree, all the same bleak and grey like he remembered from the real Purgatory. For a moment, his brain tries to figure out which world is the reality, did he dream about getting out of Purgatory and running into the djinn case while he's been here all the time, or did he actually manage to get out and now dreaming about it again in djinn's illusion?

He looks around.

Cas is there, standing by the tree three steps away from him, in the dirty trench coat with hospital gown inside. His peachy beard is as messy as he remembers.

Dean reaches for him, tentatively, putting a hand on his shoulder. The touch is solid.

Cas turns to him, a soft smile showing. "Dean," he says, in his usual low grave voice, visibly relaxed.

"Cas." Dean regards his face. He looks real, dirty and more human than angel, but looking so authentically real, with every little detail correct. But Dean knows too well it is only because he has every little detail stored in his own memory to manifest it.

He still allows himself to believe it is the real Cas, just for a second. Dean tugs him in, taking a long breath in then letting it out. He pats Cas on the back slightly, before letting him go.

"Are you alright?" Cas looks at him, eyes concerned. A look that would show on real Cas's face so very frequently.

Dean nods, then, "Are you?"

"Yes, I'm fine." Cas answers, exactly as Dean expects he would say.

But he is not. The real Cas is not. Dean remembers, and he knows every second he stays in this nasty djinn's illusion, is one second closer to his own death, let alone Cas's since he's still stuck in a different dimension.

"We have to get out of here." He says automatically, looking for the way to the portal. Cas follows him.

There are monsters and leviathans following them as well. There are a large bone blade in his hand. They seem to keep targeting Cas to attack more than having interest in him. Dean pulls Cas behind him, killing them all, not really thinking about why the change of behavior.

He checks on Cas the moment these monsters are cleared out. "You okay?"

There are more fresh blood stains on Cas's clothes, Dean finds his own brain already start painting deep cuts and wounds underneath the clothes, imagining a lifeless body Cas might turn to if he ever lets his attention slack for a split second. His jaw clutches at the thought, knowing it might be true.

And Cas says, "I'm fine."

It feels like a conversation that has happened a million times.

They reach the portal. And Cas is saying the familiar notions of portal being human-only and he should be left behind, and as always, Dean doesn't listen, doesn't even bother arguing, and holds his hands.

He crosses the portal, and this time, in this vision, Cas is pulled out together with him. Right by his side, holding his hand tight.

Is this how he gets to break the djinn's world? Dean wonders.

The black world in front of him tells the answer otherwise. His eyes blink blandly, trying to understand the view, then gradually, lights and colors and shapes start to show, like a computer slowly loading the image.

It is the dimension in between. He realizes. The place that Cas said he is being sliced and spliced, torn apart and merged together, misshaped and reshaped.

Instantly, he looks at Cas.

Cas is still by his side, but his shape is deforming like a terrible animation clip showing a character made of rubber being stretched and squeezed, pulling apart.

"Dean." Cas's mouth moves, all the while his head starts moving away from the body, involuntarily, so are the arms and legs. His body is stretched thin and long, then the limbs are torn from the torso. Wings stretching out from his shoulder blades, only to be torn down one after another, feathers flying. His eyes blinks confusedly, not showing pain, just confused, looking at Dean like that's the only thing he can think of doing.

"No, no, no, no, Cas! No --" Dean reaches for the pieces that would have made the whole Cas, grasping a feather or a fragment, but each piece is just splitting into smaller units right in front of his eyes. He can do nothing but to watch this horror show unfolding, watching Cas slowly, structurally, becomes a big pile of flesh and bones and feathers and fabric.

Never has he ever seen a more terrifying horror movie.

Dean covers his mouth with his hands, choking down the petrified yell in the throat. Cold sweat streaming down his forehead, his lips and throat too dry and tight, he can't breathe.

It has been forever since he has to experience a sense of fear like this. The last time is when his Mom burning on the ceiling.

And then, like time reverses itself, Cas is put back. Fingernails back onto fingertips, fingers to hands, hands to arms, arms to the body. The invisible hand pieces him together like placing puzzle pieces, returning Cas to him. But with things here and there off. The two hands are switched, the legs are in odd angles, the left eye is in the place where the mouth should be, mouth at ear's.

Dean gasps in terror. His throat can't squeeze a single syllable of word out, not even it is "Cas" that he wants to say.

"Dean." Even in the forced form of Frankenstein, Cas manages to call his name, in the same intensity and urgency as he often does. The eye in the right place and the eye that is not, both look at him, staring straight into him. "You have to let me go."

"No." Dean says, without thinking. "Never."

"Dean, listen to me." Cas's shape gradually return back to normal, the familiar look, the familiar face, the familiar focused blue eyes locked on Dean's. "This place isn't real, I'm not real. But you are. Let me go, that's your only way to wake up, to be safe. Or you will die." His eyes big and sad.

Dean swallows hard, knowing he's right, but, "I can't." He says, and he knows it as a fact, "I don't know how to."

The dimension opens a tear in front of them.

"Please, let me save you. Cas, I have to." Dean holds out a hand. "I can't lose you like I lost every godforsaken thing that I care about in my life."

His eyes sting, his voice sobbing.

Cas does not take his hand, so Dean drags him over, leading them both out of this creepy dimension.

Only to find they are back to the Purgatory. Leviathans lurking, vampires surrounding. The portal on top of the mountain, shining white light.

It is an infinite loop.

Cas draws his hand back, holding their stare. Hint of glittering tears at the corner of his eyes. "You have to go without me, Dean."

Dean eyes the monsters around them, looking back at the angel in front of him, voice trembling. "They'll kill you."

"Yes," Cas says, uncaring. "Let them. Or the djinn will kill *you*, Dean. This djinn feeds on fear."

"I'm not afraid of the monsters." Dean states.

"But you're afraid of losing me." Cas smiles understandingly, reaching out a hand to stroke his cheek, then lets the hand fall. He says it again, quietly but firmly, "Let me go. It's okay. I'll be okay. The real me outside will be okay too."

"God..." Dean wipes the corner of his eyes, pulling Cas into a tight hug, exhaling over his shoulder, pressing his lips on the side of his cheek.

He runs towards the portal alone, not looking back. He hears the growl of the monsters, and the sound of their teeth tearing on flesh and clothes. He can still feel the weight of a pair of blue, blue eyes locked on his back, with a small relieved smile. Exactly like the look he knows real Cas would have if he's really here.

Dean forces his eyes to not look back, wills his legs to not stop on the horrifying sounds, and jumps through the portal.

He wakes up, and he kills the djinns trapping him.

Corner of his eyes still wet. He breathes out long and unsteady. Dropping the silver blade on the floor.

#### Act 2

Dean stays awake the whole night driving away from Topeka, Kansas, heading as far away as possible. But the memory of that messed-up illusion world doesn't take it easy on him because of the distance.

The distortion and deformation of Cas's body, of his wings, haunts in his view. The stretch of the road ahead of him barely lit by the car's headlamp, in all the places that are dark, he sees the view replaying itself at the periphery of his eyes. The figures disappear the moment he moves his head and wants to look properly.

He hears Cas's voice too, now that the fake world just reminded him of that grave deep voice he doesn't realize how much he misses. The sound takes root in his brain, speaking at his ear, sometimes from afar, other times as if he's right next to him, sitting on the shotgun, reading a piece of news on some paper.

Dean has to turn his head to the shotgun half a dozen times to see the seat is empty.

The lack of sleep only makes it worse.

Dean distantly wonders if it is how it's like, back when Sam or Cas gets that craziness tumor in their brain. Seeing and hearing Lucifer has to be worse than seeing and hearing Cas everywhere. He decides, somehow slightly comforted by the thought.

He jams on the brake when he thinks the sight of Cas is walking alongside the road, too vivid, but only in a flash. He stares out of the window for a whole storming night, because for a blink of time, he swears Cas stands right there. He almost crashes the car when he thinks there is a bloody figure wrapped in trench coat lying in the middle of the road. But the figure disappears when he blinks hard.

Cas is in the dimension in between, not here. Dean reminds himself, but he doesn't know if that seance, that brief meeting time is making it better or worse. Now that he has learned where Cas is, but he still can't find him or get to him, it is not helping anything at all except for scratching his heart like a bloody hand.

The nightmares are getting worse too after that, like something in his brain gets triggered sickly, creating imagination he never has and never needs. In the rare times he dozes off, the dreams become increasingly vivid and disturbing. Always with Cas being hurt one way or another, in one place or another. He dreams about his wings broken and burn, twisted and torn, feathers dropping out and floating everywhere, his body split to pieces, then splice back wrong. The Cas in his dream, whatever shape he's in, he still always, always hold that pair of bright blue eyes, looking at him. So he would know, it is Cas that is being deformed in all the ways, but whatever the change, it is still him, and he is still in there, able to feel and sense everything. It only makes the view a million times worse. Unnerving. Horrifying.

Dean goes to a crossroad, and buries a box with his photo in it.

The demon shows up as a young pretty blondie.

Dean glances at her tiredly, the demon blade loosely in his right hand.

"Dean Winchester," the demon looks him up and down, grinning. "It's been a while. Last time you made a deal -- yourself for your brother, what is it you want this time? Or rather, who is it you want to exchange your life for?"

He swallows, hating it's being so obvious.

"First thing first, can you really reach other dimensions?"

"I might." The demon says casually.

"This is a yes-or-no question, you son of a bitch. Can you or can you not?" Dean growls.

"And my answer is, I might." The demon doesn't flinch. "Now it's your turn, either you trust me, or you don't."

Dean is deflated. "What do you want in return? Ten years?"

"That would be too good to be true, isn't it?" The demon smiles a cheap smile. "We both know Hell can't hold you, and as soon as your boyfriend is topside, he'd just fetch you out of there anyway."

Dean puffs. "Then what?"

"What about --" The demon makes a contemplating postures, "I fetch him out, then you jump in?"

"What?" Dean glares at her.

"Would be a lot more fun, isn't it? Somewhere out of reach. Then we can wait and see how he would deal with it and tear everything down to get to you, just like how you are now."

The demon is right, then he'd just make Cas feel as awful as he is now. Dean realizes. As much as he wants Cas back, he can't do that to him, put him through all these misery, and god knows what he'd do to handle. Dude has blasted the Purgatory open once, he might even tears the whole multidimension down if he can find Dean that way -- hell, *he* wants to do that too, only limited to not do that because he's human, but Cas, Cas might actually can and will.

"He'd smite your brain out the first thing." Dean replies.

The demon deadpans, "Pity you won't be there to watch it or see how broken he'd be."

Dean growls, marching ahead with the demon blade raised high. The demon takes a hurried step back, "Easy tiger, there is still a terrifying little girl in here, you wouldn't harm her, would you?"

Dean pauses, lowering the blade, but the killing look in his eyes doesn't recede. "I'll just separate your demonic true form from your body then."

The words slip out without second thinking, but the moment it reaches his ear, it makes an awakening drumming so loud that he startles himself and has to steady his step to not falling to the ground.

*Separating the true form from the body.* Didn't Cas say his main problem is the true form being spliced with body, therefore making him giant and stuck in that dimension? So what if there is a way to separate them for him, and putting them back together right, like breaking the wrongly-grown-together bones, so that they can be joined correctly later.

He eyes the demon in front of him, and has a better idea.

<br>

The Gas'n'Sip rings a small bell when the door is pushed open. The store is empty with only a girl in leather jacket and brunette hair standing in front of the register, checking out some gums and snacks. She doesn't look up because the cashier is handing her the changes.

A man approaches her from behind, a blade jabbed at her back, hidden by a jacket, voice low. "We need to talk."

Meg snorts a laughter, doesn't bother looking back. "Dean. Nice to see you too. Aren't you going to buy me some dinner first?"

"Sure, the drink will be holy water." Dean's tone flat, "Now, walk."

They end up stopping by a deserted factory.

"I got to ask, Dean, how did you even find me?" Meg asks, genuinely curious. "Thought I laid low enough."

"A little bird told me." Dean says, stoic.

"You mean you tortured a demon." Meg reads his face. "Just to find me? You do know how to flatter a girl."

Dean ignores her. "What do you know about angel expel spell?"

"Angelic exorcism? Why, trouble in paradise?" Meg looks truly intrigued now. "Cas pissed you off so mad you're gonna banish him to Heaven? That's surely more fascinating than Saturday night soup opera."

"Not like that." The thought of Cas leaving for Heaven makes him uneasy. Dean shifts his feet.

"Care to elaborate?" Meg raises her eyebrows.

"Not your business." Dean bites out.

"Fine," Meg looks away, dropping the smile. "So I learned a thing or two during my time with yellow-eyes, Azazel never used it, but Alastair can't stop showing off. But I heard the only time he tried the spell was right before he got burned clean once and for all."

Dean looks at her intensely. "Which angel did he use the spell on?" Memory of the day Alastair died was still all too clear. That's also the devastating day of knowing he was the one who jump started the apocalypse, the day Sam killed the demon just by his freaking mind.

"Your beloved Castiel, of course." Meg says lightly. Dean only feels sick.

"Just, tell me the words." He tries hard to push away the image of Alastair holding his dirty demon hand on Cas's forehand, incantating the angel exorcism spell. Cas's eyes would probably shine bright and white, his grace and essence would fly upwards until they reach the Heaven, if Heaven still wants him in. He can't imagine how the first apocalypse would have ended if Cas wasn't there for him.

"*Omnipotentis Dei potestatem invoco!* ..." Meg recites. Dean tries his best, and memorizes the whole thing.



#### draft notes

Angels are more like demons than humans in the sense that they too need to possess bodies to walk the Earth. But need extra help of how to expel angel from body without banishing them away altogether (so angel banishing spell is out of option)

how does Dean know the angel expel spell: Meg tells Dean, the spell expels angel's true form without blasting them away, bc Alastair has done that (S04E16)

how does Dean find Meg: tortured crossroad demons, (Meg in random place e.g. gas'n'sip) Meg willing to help bc she does love Cas too

what's the catch: he can die -> still need to fix that tear once Cas comes through, and makes a place to host Cas, *death is an infinite vessel* (S15E03)

why Alaska: world's end, veil thinnest (Meg: "Try Ushuaia or Norway if you want, but figured Alaska would be the closest to you")

**order of events**: Meg -> visit Sam & Lisa & Jody in a distance one last time, quiet farewells -> get the info & method & location, go to Alaska to get Cas

Dean visited Sam's place at the end of summer, it's almost one year after he came back from Purgatory now

Sam looks happy with Amelia, there is a dog called Dog. Dean smiles when he goes on a running with the Dog by his side, sees the girl's brightened up smile when she opens the door for him and they hug like they haven't seen each other for a year. Dean leaves quietly without saying hi.

Sam added a large iron lock on the garage door, hinting he did notice impala was missing, but Dean doesn't know what he'd done with it, doesn't know if he'd panicked for a bit but decides it doesn't matter

tears are form when Dean yearns the most desperately -> first two cases are both when he's dying, third one is just because he's so lonely and missing Cas so much it's also killing him, the danger is inferred suicidal/self-sacrifice thoughts

<br>

outlines: Dean drives around, keeps getting spooky feeling of continuously being watched, hears local legend of Cthulhu (otherworldly god-like, humanoid, huge, tentacle, incomprehensible, hundreds of meters tall) in Alaska, sees weird/astonishing aurora lights on sky (abnormalcy is massive light & color in sky, beautiful, astonishing), drives there. midnight, empty road, tear opens, sees giant Cas manifest in full size right in front of impala, wings+rings with eyes+trench coat. Dean shocked/terrified/in awe.

Dean&Cas grab a few moments to talk, Cas worries his reaction at first, Dean needs time to adjust, sees him for real now, rings with too many eyes, not react/communicate well. Cas sensitive, feel rejected/upset, afraid Dean disgust/fear his true form now, self-aware being monster. Cas gets weaker quickly for staying in this dimension talking for long, fighting against natural order, and with the tear more twisted light & colors, affecting/endanger the sky/air now, increased electricity/magnetism. For Dean's safety and Cas's own exhaustion, Cas almost gets pulled back again (almost give up fighting), Dean starts ritual before tear closes. [both POV, Cas upset, self-aware]

### Chap. 5 Inside the Mind (Ritual+reunion)

> **Outline:** Dean's solution: needs to separate Cas's true form from vessel, expel him then bound him again, banishing+summoning spell+holy fire circle
>
> Dean's idea: expel him (S04E16 Alastair's spell; separate true form with body) and immediately summon him back (S06E21 angel summoning spell; avoid true form going into heaven), let Cas possess him as vessel temporarily, use his own power fix his vessel's size, jump back into his body. Cas hesitates for risk of hurting Dean (possession+tear open with monsters coming) and he won't be there protecting him, doesn't mention also afraid of getting expelled and not summoned in time make him end up in Heaven, "might kill himself"
>
> Dean insists trying, ritual works, Cas shares Dean's body but both awake, Cas use mojo to fix vessel (Dean witnesses, amazed, "so this is how it's like, internally" "that sounds so wrong but whatever") and ready to go back into it (Cas all the time quiet), Dean mentally apologize and tell him his true form is awesome before Cas goes back (talk in Dean's brain, both normal: "You really think that?" "Yeah, I do"). Cas leaves Dean's body, vessel remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, problem solved, "Welcome back."
