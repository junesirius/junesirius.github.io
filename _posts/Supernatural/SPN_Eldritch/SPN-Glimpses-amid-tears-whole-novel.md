## Draft

### Art prompt

> Castiel leaves purgatory through the portal with Dean, but since Cas is in a vessel without a soul the human portal has unexpected consequences and Castiel is stuck in a spliced form of his true form and human vessel. Cas is stuck between dimensions and keeps fighting to get back to the same plane as Dean, and the process of reappearing creates omens that Dean can trace to find him when he does briefly appear in his giant form.

### Outline (1st draft)

time: October 2012

Dean comes back from purgatory, witnesses Cas get torn apart the moment he pass through the portal and disappears, doesn't know if Cas is killed in the process, determined to find Cas if he's not (self-comfort: maybe he's just pulled away, like angel-banishing spell). Dean goes to find Sam, Sam is living with Amelia happily, Dean decides not pull him out of apple pie life again, goes to hunt/search on his own, actively looks for monster/Leviathan/angel sign

Dean finds case of yeti in snow mountain (Rocky Mountain, Colorado), rumor says bigfoot trace but not bare foot, dress shoe trace, witness says seeing trench coat fabric but must be hallucination, Dean raises hope, starts searching, finds tear of dimension and bloody coat fabric in it (too big), believes Cas is out there (keep feeling being watched). finds actual Yeti escaped from purgatory, Yeti-Troll fights, Dean gets in between and almost gets killed, saved by angelic light but can't see Cas; the grace light weave into tear, sends monsters back and fix the hole, Cas gets pulled away as it closes [+Cas POV: dark, confused, chaotic, stumble foot print in snow, pulled away before manifest]

Dean follows giant monster witness report, rumor says Archaeopteryx (ancient first bird fossil) in place with huge tall trees (Redwood, California). Dean drives there, gets spooked, feels being watched but no one around, thinks he sees shape of giant Cas's wings in night black but disappear in a blink (only get a glimpse), thinks he's going crazy, finds another tear of dimension and bloody feather in it (too big). almost gets killed by Greek creature Harpy (half-human half-bird, eat human, decapitation) and gets saved by Cas, protected by six huge black wings (Cas wants to talk but only in true voice and too loud, breaks glasses, but Dean is sure by now it's Cas), Cas gets pulled away again as the tear closes [+Cas POV: can't talk, can't stay, self-aware weird shape, watch Dean from the other side, see him hurt and fight to force through to save, weakened by each attempt]

Dean goes to Missouri, Pamela's seance had witnessed Cas's true form in multidimension then so can Missouri (use feather/coat fabric as medium), Dean gets info hint that Cas's true form and vessel are spliced and he's stuck, swears to find&help him. [+Cas POV: meet with Missouri in seance/spirit dimension, can talk/see, hesitant to come back because not want to continue tear dimension to endanger reality&Dean]

Dean drives around, keeps getting spooky feeling of continuously being watched, hears local legend of Cthulhu (humanoid, huge, tentacle, hundreds of meters tall) in Alaska, sees weird/astonishing aurora lights on sky, drives there. midnight, empty road, tear opens, sees giant Cas manifest in full size right in front of impala, wings+rings with eyes+trench coat, leviathans also come through the tear. Dean shocked/terrified/in awe then busy fighting, giant Cas kills them (easier than normal size but easily tired). Dean&Cas grab a few moments to talk/sync (the physics theory behind), Cas worries his reaction at first, Dean needs time to adjust, sees him for real now, not react/communicate well. Cas sensitive, feel rejected/upset, afraid Dean disgust/fear his true form now, self-aware being monster. Cas gets weaker quickly for staying in this dimension talking for long, fighting against natural order, and with the tear more leviathans coming through. For Dean's safety and Cas's own exhaustion, Cas gets pulled back and tear closes. [both POV, Cas upset, self-aware]

Dean's idea (convey through pray): expel him (S04E10/16 Alastair's spell; separate true form with body) and immediately summon him back (S06E21 angel summoning spell; avoid true form going into heaven), let Cas possess him as vessel temporarily, use his own power fix his vessel's size, jump back into his body. talk through Ouija Board, Cas hesitates for risk of hurting Dean (possession+tear open with monsters coming) and he won't be there protecting him, doesn't mention also afraid of getting expelled and not summoned in time make him end up in Heaven, "might kill himself"

Dean insists trying, ritual works, Cas shares Dean's body but both awake, Cas use mojo to fix vessel (Dean witnesses, amazed, "so this is how it's like, internally" "that sounds so wrong but whatever") and ready to go back into it (Cas all the time quiet), Dean mentally apologize and tell him his true form is awesome before Cas goes back (talk in Dean's brain, both normal: "You really think that?" "Yeah, I do"). Cas leaves Dean's body, vessel remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, problem solved, "Welcome back."

### Cas's pieces

- trench coat/tie clothing fabric
- wing/feather
- ring/eyes
- light/grace

### Monster inspire/reference

case fic? actually all Cas

- yeti/big foot: only see footprint (~3m)
- Godzilla: biggest ~300m
- Cthulhu: humanoid, tentacles, otherworldly god, hundreds of meters
- Mega-Kaiju: (Pacific Rim) biggest ~100m
- alien, transformer, predator, king kong

real case fic source of monster:

(stick with basics and reuse S8 everyday monsters)

- vampire
- werewolf
- djinn
- ghost
- ~~leviathan~~
- ~~demon~~

### Theory/physics

Tear of dimension: leave power/energy surge/draining, break wall between spaces, free traveling around between dimensions (≈purgatory exit)

Cas's true form: multidimensional wavelength celestial being, size of Chrysler Building (319m, ~1k feet)

Why giant: true form wavelength gets twisted at the edge of dimension, think of as how light get refracted on different media interface e.g. water-air surface; or quantum physics, wave-particle duality, wave longer after passing through smaller slit, diffraction effect

Dean: "Cas, English" Cas: "going through portal makes me giant"

Dean: "Who's dragging you away?" Cas: "Law of physics"

Dean: "Are you saying you're here, but the other part of you is still in some wormhole space?"

Cas: "In a manner of speaking, yes"

Dean: "How can I get you back, the whole complete you, not pieces of glimpses here and there" Cas: "I don't know" don't know if it's even possible, or if he really wants given the risks on Dean

Solution: needs to separate true form from vessel, expel him then bound him again, banishing+summoning spell+holy fire circle

(above is conversation during seance by Missouri)

### Reference

ominous spooky feeling: ≈P3 Sirius Black bad omen black dog (fearful but fundamentally good-natured, mysterious, suspension)

high dimension: Interstellar (2014, not released yet; current=2012, time swap)

something big and huge and enormous: The Drowned Giant (Love, Death, Robot S2)

### Easter Egg

Chap. 2, the legends of the giant fish and bird: quote from 庄周《逍遥游》“北冥有鱼，其名为鲲。鲲之大，不知其几千里也；化而为鸟，其名为鹏。鹏之背，不知其几千里也，怒而飞，其翼若垂天之云。”

Chap. 2, how does Dean know about the names of the trees, plants, creatures and birds: apparently Cas has dragged him to watch Nature channel together more than once, and he actually paid attention. Especially the bird part, he doesn't even realize he has a thing for them until much later and also in here, he realizes he does memorized those things and names he watched, while thinking about Cas's wings. But still, even when they were watching together and when he was definitely thinking about Cas's wings, he never really asked, so he never know Cas's wings true color or there are three pairs of them. (could potentially add an epilogue of watching bird Nature channel together or go back to the Redwood again with Cas guiding and introducing the creatures/plants, and Dean's knowledge surprise Cas too)

Chap. 4, "did he dream about purgatory when he's outside, or did he dream about outside when he's still in purgatory" is like 庄周梦蝶蝶梦庄周

Chap. 4-3 The joke Amelia says by Sam's ear is: "I hope you won't name our kid 'Kid'."

Chapter titles "In your eyes" "Inside my minds": "your" and "my" mean both of them

Chap. 6 the shrinking body, the lost mass becomes energy, that's the mass-energy equivalence

Chap. 6 the infinite past and future possibilities: inspired by DW the long song episode

### Dean's mental state

≈S08E01-07

mission mode, focus on the saving mission

focus on guilty, heavy self-blame, feel crap for not getting Cas back complete

he can only save Cas if he lets go of some of that blame/guilt

### Cas's mental state

≈S08E07-10

focus on self-punishment, torn between dimension and true form & vessel=torn between saving heaven vs earth, choosing angel vs human, go back to purgatory for self-punishment/penance vs go back to earth to help/protect Dean

so every time Cas fights hard to tear through dimension to get to this plane, to protect Dean, he gets more wounded and weaker in celestial part, so the fighting back itself is a step closer to the final decision point and away from torn state, so finally he can get out of the intertwined quantum superposition state, he comes back to Dean once he figure out he can only protect Dean if he forgives himself (more or less), his choice is always Dean more than anything else

**main curve**: Cas needs to really decide on the answer to "What are you, angel or human" (if angel, true form; if human, body) -> but he *is* both

### Edit Notes

~~(general, especially Chap. 1) memory from Purgatory use past tense, the rest use present tense~~

~~(Chap. 1-4, 2-4) Cas's POV, 1st person view to 3rd person view? but maintain Cas's POV~~

wings flutter -> rustle

anchoring -> grounding

wince/grimace -> cringe

atoms and electrons -> atoms and molecules

~~loud: the sound of mountains moving, oceans turning, volcanos exploding~~

~~several inch/feet away -> yards away~~

hospital gown -> white hospital shirt and pants

~~canopy of twinkling stars~~

dislocated

croak, rasp

(general) change all the bad analogies to the proper ones with references Dean would use, e.g. remove all Disney movies & fairy tales & princesses & Anderson's Little Match Girl, replace with old classic movies & rock bands & western movies

(Chap. 3) Dean has no body but only eyes, "like the one painted on Missouri's round table"

(during posting, on AO3) posting Chap 1 Act 1,2,3 as Chap 1 Part One, Act 4 as Chap 1 Part Two (second AO3 chapter but same my chapter title); same for Chap 2; Chap 3's Appendix put at the very end after last chap (put a "Not a Chapter" by the chapter title), then Chap 3's after-work notes link to appendix (once published and have link); Appendix after-work notes add the Amelia-Sam joke about "Kid" from Chap 4-3

(Chap. 1-5) add more flashback, broken!Cas & god!Cas & Leviathan year & Purgatory time, emphasize more on the damage they've done, and the mental states those past caused them

(all Chaps) examine first/third person view in *thoughts* with/without POVs

~~(Chap. 5/6) balance chap. 5/6 length, can move Chap.6-1/2 to Chap.5-2/3, depend on how long Chap.6 end up with once finished~~

#### Act 1

Dean slams on the gas hard, the stolen car roars in exhaustion, kicking up the dirt along the way. Dean rolls the window down, not caring the dirt flowing in and out. Not like they could make his face any dirtier than he already is. Not like there is any place on Earth can get any dirtier than the place he just came back from.

The night road stretches, ahead, and broad on both sides. Empty. No sight of another human being, not a single passing car. The frogs croak loudly in the fields along the road.

Dean just stares at the road, and drives. Like it's the only thing he can think of. It's the only thing he can still trust himself to do, without breaking anything, or losing anything, again.

He drives on the freeway from the 100-miles wilderness in Maine, to west, to south, to anywhere the road leads him to. He drives, so he doesn't need to think, or talk, or eat, or sleep. As if it can just last so long, that all the things he left behind, all the things he just lost, would never catch up.

<br>

They still catch up. Of course they do. The images and sounds and smells of that filthy place. The memory of everything happened in the past year. They catch up to him and circle him around, like a snake coils around its prey before devouring the food in whole when they are still alive. Dean is the food and prey of the serpent conjured by his own brain, made up of this bitter bloody thing called "memory".

"Dean --" He remembers Cas calling his name. Desperate. His eyes on him. His hands in his. His whole life and trust and everything he carries, all put in the hands they held together. Dean saw them all in Cas's eyes, heard them all in his voice. Dean grasped him tight, and didn't let go.

The palms were slippery with blood and sweat. Every inch of his muscle in arms and backs screamed in stretched strain, the stress turned into sharp pain shortly, but he didn't let go. He didn't. Cas's whole weight leaned onto him, depended on him. So Dean held him tight, just as desperate, like the whole world was on the hands he held, because it might as well was.

And then, it stopped. The weight disappeared. The hands loosened. They stepped over the portal together, Dean remembered agonizingly clearly, he fell onto the solid ground of the sweet Earth, and two feet besides him where Cas was, it was just a blast of bright light, and then, there was nothing.

He heard Cas's scream, whether it's his human voice pitching too high or it's his shrieking angel voice, he couldn't tell. All he saw was the silvery light of Cas's grace exploded in front of him, torn apart at the moment of passing. His last voice broken and painful. He yelled for him for the last time, then he was not there anymore. Nowhere to be found.

Cas had mentioned too damn many times they had no idea if the portal would allow an angel to pass, but they agreed to try, together. And they did. But just like every other long shots in their bloody lives -- the bleak hopes, the only plan, they never work.

Dean yelled Cas's name, shouted until throat hoarse. He would have torn the reality a hole right then and there if he knew how, just to tear open the portal again, to see if Cas fell back into the Monsterland. He would jump back into the place to get Cas back, he swore, just like he had told him, the bottom line is, they are going home together, and he wouldn't leave if Cas is not here with him.

But promises are empty, swears fall into nothing. He is here, and Castiel is not.

Dean stares hard at the front of the windshield, gazing at the road so hard and rigid without blinking that it starts making his eyes watery. Cas should be here, by his side, sitting in the shotgun. They should go home, together.

Dean punches the wheel, swearing, cursing. The first hint of the sunrise emerges from the end of the road, piercing right into his eyes. He blinks in the sudden light, the golden color looks nothing like Castiel's grace but light is light. Dean blinks again, the dried eyes finally gather enough moisture at the corner that tears threaten to drop.

Dean wipes his eyes roughly with the back of his hands. The wetness mixes with the dirt and dried blood stains that still cover his hands, making a mess. He presses the accelerator pad harder, urging the vehicle forwards, as if he's rushing to a destination, as if he knows where to go, or where to find Cas.

"You are not dead, Cas." Dean growls at the empty road ahead of him. He's not gone, he *knows* that. Just blown away by the portal, or something like that. *I'll get you back.* Dean promises. *I can find you in the Purgatory, I'll find you again.*

The car rolls ahead in a louder engine moan, speeding on the road that is slowly lightened up by the newborn sun.

<br>

All of Sam's cellphones are offline, Dean tries every single one that he can remember, but pretty much always gets a robotic voice telling him empty service or empty number, barely even any having Sam's recorded voice played out, asking for a voicemail. He tries his own old cells too, no difference.

It takes three days to track Sam down again. The patterns and old habits die hard, traces scattered around like bread crumbs. He rolls into the small town of Kermit, Texas, parking in front of a white fence house.

Thin white curtain with laces half covers the room. He glances inside.

Sam stands by a woman, holding her close. The two of them are kissing, gently. For the most of the time, they are just holding each other together, his hands on her shoulder, hers on his waist, simply having their foreheads pressed together, breathing each other's breathe, like the way when people dancing to an old classic waltz.

Dean looks at this white-fence apple-pie life they had talked about, sometimes dreamed about, never once really believed can be theirs.

He drives away. Leaving the house in his rearview.

They even have flowers with small purple blossoms in the garden, poking out between the fences, ignorant of the early winter chillness of October.

Dean leaves the town after the midnight -- but not before he sneaks into the garage and drives away in his impala. The Baby was covered by a neat canvas. The keys hang by the garage door.

*You get a home now, at least let me have mine.* Dean thinks when he sits into the familiar driver's seat, reversing onto the road, wondering for a minute how long it would even take before Sam notices the impala isn't where it was. For a brief moment, he wonders if this is exactly how Cas feels, seeing him with Lisa right when he was knee deep in trouble but didn't have the heart to knock on that freshly painted door.

You don't knock on a door like that, not with the hand that can never wash clean from the layered and dried blood stains.

He leaves the town under the starry sky, the road empty and vast like it always is these days.

<br>

#### Act 2

There are still work to do. There are always work, somewhere. Monsters, ghosts, something dark, something evil, something lurking in the night, waiting to tear people's heart out or drink their blood dry.

Dean is good at finding things in the dark. But this time, he's looking for something in the light. Something bright and glaring, fluffy and feathery, something -- someone -- holy and angelic. *The angel.*

As much as he would say angels are nothing more than monsters with good PR, as many times as Cas has explained he doesn't have a harp, it seems when he thinks of Cas, he still can't help thinking of halos and wings. The same image in his mind when he was four, every night when his mom told him angels were watching over him. So that's what he looks for.

It starts turning into a routine. Dean gets into the habit of picking up a piece of newspaper at the breakfast and reading through over the coffee. Then he sits in the cafe for a whole day going through people's mention of angelic encounters online. He scans and scrolls, reads and looks, squints at the words of the witnesses and illustrations from the visionaries, thinking, if any of these can be a sign of Cas. If any of them can be luckier than he is, and has a glimpse of Cas while he cannot.

Then he drives, and reads, and asks people around if there is anything weird and holy happening, anything like sudden increased temperature or bright lights and thunderous sound, and orders more papers and coffee. Then he hits the road again.

The days and roads are muffled together. Dean distantly realizes he might get as bearded and dirty as he was in Purgatory, and he decides he doesn't care. He punches the word "angel" into the laptop searching bar again.

<br>

There are some pagan gods in Wyoming, some werewolves in Michigan, and then some more pagan gods in Colorado. Dean takes care of them.

He has hoped maybe some of those pagan gods could have enough juice that he can negotiate to use. But at the end of the day, none of them are anything more than a bunch of bloodthirsty sons of bitches. Dean buries the knives into their chests or cuts their heads off, whatever works.

Blood of the gods and creatures splatter onto his face. Dean gets so used to it now he doesn't flinch or blink.

Some of these days, the Earth feels no different from the Purgatory. Full of ugly things, and none of the one he's looking for.

He still prays every night. And he drives on.

By November, he has cleaned a nest of vampires in Washington and killed a nasty spectre in Missouri. The winter is falling onto him quickly. But the coldness is the last thing he would worry.

The first snow catches him when he's in Rocky Mountain, Colorado, thinking of cutting the state in a short cut, when the blizzard almost buries half the car. He stays in a tourist center on the waist of the mountain, stuck with a group of chatty tourists too stupid to travel without checking weather report. He stares at the roaring snow outside of the window painting the whole world white and blank. Separated from the rest of the world.

There was no snow in the Purgatory. Or rain. Or sun.

Everything was just grey and bleak, trees half-dead with only trunks standing, ground covered by dirt of corroded skeletons.

So at least, if nothing else, the snow is a good reminder that this is really the Earth. Dean watches the strong wind blowing snowflakes as large as his palm onto the window, then adding layers after layers. The view is soon blocked by the thick cover of snow and ice.

"No, I'm telling you, it's true, there are yetis in this mountain. Legends say they only come out in storms like this, feeding on lost hikers. The snow hides their traces too well so they are super difficult to track, but we still managed to take some photos." Some remote chatter reaches his ear. Dean focuses on the bitter coffee in his hands, trying to block out any mention of new monster or legends. He isn't really in a hunting mood right now.

Coldness seeps in from the gaps of the windows.

He hears laughter from the crowd, whatever photo that man is showing around, the rest of the group isn't buying. A young woman's mocking voice is loud enough for him to hear from across the lobby:"This can't possibly be a bigfoot trace, Hector. What do you take us for, idiots? Look at the footprint, it's not even barefoot, might as well be a size-hundred dress shoe. Unless you're saying yetis start wearing suits and dress shoes?" The crowd bursts into laughter.

Dean ducks his head and takes another drink of his coffee that's already getting cold. Cas used to wear dress shoes. It's been a long while seeing him in the suits though, with everything so messed up and he ended up in a hospital gown that even got carried over into the other side of the portal, Dean finds himself missing that suit and funny little reversed tie.

He doesn't realize a tiny little curl starts pulling on the tip of his lips.

It's been too long. The last time they were both themselves, it's like years and years ago. Decades even, so it feels. Before the Purgatory, before the broken Sam, before the Leviathans, or Raphael. Long, long time ago when he could still straighten his ties, and tell Cas he's "also an FBI", only to watch the badge got displayed upside down.

God, how he wished this is still then.

His lips drop entirely. He drinks another sip of the coffee. It's completely cold now.

"If you don't believe the photo, I guess you won't believe what I saw by my own eyes, then." The man that must be Hector insists, voice over the lingering chuckles that haven't died down. "I swear to God, on the day I took the photo, I saw a yeti that was so much larger than any in the record. It must be at least sixty feet tall, and the most weird thing is its color. Not like any other white yetis, this one had a beige color, and the back standing so straight, if I don't know any better, I might say it's a giant in a trench coat."

Dean jerks up his head so fast the movement even startles himself. He jumps to his feet, marching towards the group and grabbing the man by the collar before he even realizes what he's doing. "What did you say?" He scowls right into the man's face.

Hector stutters. "Chill, man. Just some story time. I was telling the ladies the other night when I was on the mountain. Just so happened to see this weird ass yeti."

"The trench coat, what's it like?" Dean shakes his collar, the man is practically raised to his toes like a cat picked up by the neck.

"Are you crazy? I don't know, just a trench coat. I mean, it's probably nothing, lights and reflections or something." Hector protests and pushes at his shoulder.

Dean lets him go. "And you say he's on top of the mountain in a snow storm like this one?"

"*He*?" Hector flattens his wrinkled clothes, laughing, "Yeah, sure, on the highest top, standing by a big pile of fire with cooked human meat, dancing with other woman yetis!" The group of tourists burst into a larger outburst of laughter.

Dean turns around, walking straight towards the door.

"Sir, it's too dangerous to go outside in this weather." One of the workers of the place calls after him.

Dean doesn't look back. "I'm going." He says.

<br>

#### Act 3

It's freezing cold outside. In fact, "freezing" is just too weak of a term for this temperature. Any word that can be thought of for this weather has already been blown away by the blizzard and frozen into the ground.

The snow has heaped up and frozen the door of the place. He has to climb out from one of the highest windows near the ceiling. The building is mostly buried in the unprecedented storm -- the most fierce and sudden one that ever hit in all the recorded history, according to those people back in there.

Dean can sense every inch of his skin dropping temperature fast, he might only have minutes, or seconds, before his body is frozen into some ice sculpture. He maybe -- extremely likely -- literally frozen to death, if he's not buried alive first.

But knowing what he knows now, there is no way he would just sit inside and do nothing. He can fight through the Purgatory from one end to the other, certainly he can survive some snow storm in Colorado.

Dean walks into the storm, and starts walking towards the mountaintop, where the rumors hold. The snowflakes are as sharp as angel blades, cutting him bloody, but there is no dripping blood. Even the sliced veins are frozen to closed the minute they're wounded. The pain is sharp in the first minute, but numbed soon after. He doesn't feel like walking in the icy water anymore, more like in boiling water, the coldness feels hot. He knows some temperature sensors in his body must have been failing. But he can't care about that right now.

He can't see anything, there is nothing other than a whole complete whiteness in front of him, with all kinds of different shades. He pushes one step after another, but can't tell the difference between each step. He wonders if he's really moving up, or just making the same movement in the same place.

The storm gets more fierce when the top is nearer. The trees are getting sparse, the color of the snow darker. Dean widens his eyes to the biggest extend, searching the sky, the ground, the wood, the mountain. Searching the whole world for a glimpse of color that is different from the whiteness. Looking for a footprint or a hint of beige.

"This is suicide, Dean." The voice he's way too familiar with sounds up somewhere close by.

"Cas?" Dean spins around, turning sharp towards the sound.

"Dangerous, reckless, and stupid. You could die here, buried alive, and I'd never find you or your corpse again, you ever thought about that?" Cas's voice scolding. Sad.

"What?" Dean stills. Thinking, then tries, "You're not real, aren't you? I'm hallucinating."

"Hypothermia could lead to highly realistic hallucination. It's scientifically tested and confirmed already." "Cas" walks out of the storm, standing in front of him. In his clean trench coat and straight suit, blue tie tilted and reversed in the front. Hairs unbelievably disheveled but not moving in the storm wind. Eyes as blue as the deepest sea and highest autumn sky. The view of the Angel-of-the-Lord as he remembered from the first time they met, the look he forever dreamed about among all the other looks that he had.

"Cas." Dean murmurs, reaching out to him, fingers catching nothing but snowflakes. The snow doesn't feel cold anymore.

He pulls a sad smile, looking at "Cas" in the eyes. "I've been looking for you, Cas. Promised I'd find you and bring you home. But looks like I can't even keep that promise, I'm sorry."

"Cas" has a smile just as sad as his. "You're dying, Dean." He tells him, something he already knew, and then, "I won't let that happen. I can't."

Dean can't really think straight right now, about the meaning of the sentences. The low temperature makes his brain as sluggish as his hands and feet, working slower by each second, just like the gradually slowing down heart beat sound that he hears of his own.

That is when the view in front of his eyes changes entirely. Dean blinks slowly, can't understand what he's seeing.

It is as if the storm is split into two halves, like a curtain drawing open on the opera stage. To his left and right, snows and blizzards continue, but right in front of him in the middle, a figure as tall as sky emerges, stepping towards him slowly. Each step stomping on the ground, shaking the earth, like the giant from the Jack and Beanstalk story.

Dean wants to step back, wants to look up, wants to speak. There are so many things he wants to do, the instinct is telling him to run away, or to fight, but his body is too frozen to move. So he just stares, feeling the newly risen adrenalin forcing the heart beating faster. His brain struggles to parse the reality and the view.

The figure wears a long trench coat, reaching to his knees, which is taller than the highest tree in their surroundings. Dean looks up, head as high as his frozen neck allows but still can't see the head of the figure, barely reach the skirt of the trench coat sweeping in the storm. He gasps, his sound choked in his throat.

It is Cas. It is undoubtedly Cas. But it is so unlike Cas, not in any form he has ever known. Not in any history or legend. But it is Cas, for sure. He just knows.

Dean would know him from anywhere, in any form. Not just the trench coat, but his existence. The weight of his stare falling on to him even if he can't see his eyes; the heat of concern radiating from his body, almost practically melting the snow and ice surround them. And most of all, who else would ever like this, always comes to him at the moment of dying. Hell is the first time, Green Room the second, Dean has long lost count of how many more are there.

"Cas." This time Dean really is smiling now. Dirt and snow and hint of blood and cuts smudged on his face, making the smallest pull of muscle a pain, but he's smiling now, big and stupidly.

He steps forward, but Cas retracts. There is a thunderous sound rolling from above, as if coming directly from the sky, low and deafening, like the rage of Greek gods befalling on top of the Mount Olympus.

But it's not a voice of rage, nor warning. Dean can't understand the syllable, but if he knows Cas at all -- which he does -- then he'd know, this is his own name. He would have known his own name in every single tongue Cas speaks, and the tone would remain the same.

He takes another step forward, carefully, but Cas's figure takes another step back. One step, and he's a hundred feet away. The blizzard around them starts roaring again, reaching back to the same amount of intensity and fierceness. But closely around Dean, there is still a safe little area of warmth, blocked out from the storm, like a bubble in space, sparkled golden and silver, the color of Cas's grace.

"What's wrong?" Dean manages, sound overshadowed by the blizzard the moment they leave his mouth.

Cas makes another sound, one word, not "Dean", certainly not "Hello".

"No, no, no, no! Cas!" Dean yells, desperately, instinctively, "Wait! Don't! Not 'Goodbye' again! Not so soon! Stay, please!"

Cas turns around, stepping aside. That is when he sees it. A tear in the space behind him, like a big ugly wound of the reality standing vertical, opening up like Sauron's evil eye glaring down at the earth. Grey and black smoke flowing in and out of the edge, like curtains flying in the wind, more ominous than when Hell's Gate is opened. The blizzard starts right from the center of it, and god knows what other things must have come through from that hole, or what is on the other side.

Cas must be blocking the hole with his own body -- this giant body he has now, however that happened.

"Cas..." Dean hates it he can't do anything, especially when he knows exactly what is going to happen next, the same nightmare that he's been having for ages, after the day of the Cage opens, after Cas walks into the river. The same worst thing he feared every single night at the Purgatory, and it seems, with Cas, it's just gonna keep replaying.

Dean tries running, forcing his frozen legs and body to move, forcing himself to close up the distance between. He runs as fast as he can. And Cas takes one step back, putting another hundred feet between them. Then another.

Cas is right in front of that huge tear of the dimension now. Bright light start leaking out from him, seeping into the opening, weaving onto it like needles and threads fixing a patch on a piece of cloth, closing it bit by bit.

"Please..." Dean begs, so quiet even himself can barely hear it. Cas's figure starts fading, lights dimming, the hole shrinking. But right before it gets completely sewed up by the bright light of grace, a slicker thread of light flies away from the rest, flying towards Dean.

Dean watches it, dizzily, not realizing his eyes are so teary that the light of the grace is all fuzzed and smudged like a piece of soaked art. The thin thread of light fly onto his forehead, touches his skin and immediately sinks into it.

The warmth soaks him from top to bottom, like the best hot water shower he can use at this moment, chasing the last hint of coldness from the snow storm out of his body. The exact same feeling whenever Cas touches him and heals him.

Dean looks up again. At the place where the tear of the space was, it is now a clean smooth stand of sky, and air. There is no nasty thing from other dimension, there is no bright light of needles and threads.

There is no Cas, again. Not even a sign to prove it wasn't a dream. Except for the lingering warmth that still flows in his body.

The killing snow storm starts dying down, like the residue water running out from a faucet during water outrage. Then it stops completely. The world is fixed, at least this part, he realizes belatedly, when the tear is mended, when Cas is gone.

He stares at the sky that is clearing. Blue as crystal. He blinks hard.

A piece of fabric, drifts down from the middle of air, slowly flying to the ground, landed on the snow. Beige color, trench coat texture, torn and blood stained.

Dean picks it up, puts it in the chest pocket closest to his heart.

<br>

#### Act 4 (Cas POV)

It is dark.

This place.

It is shredding.

Cutting.

Confusing.

Everything is pieces.

Then they are not.

Floating.

Swimming.

Chaotic.

The dimension in between.

<br>

It takes time, really long time to find the pieces together.

But what is time, when time is not a dimension.

When time, can also be torn apart, like everything else, in this dimension.

Words are difficult to find, with characters and syllables.

Mind and body and grace and existence alike.

Which is the right place, for which piece of puzzle, floating by.

Woven, with the pain and bitter and guilt and penance.

Kneading, into every fabric.

Every fabric of the dimension.

Every fabric of one existence.

*Who is building me up this time?*

*Not God. Me.*

*I'm putting me together.*

*But, then, Theseus's Ship,*

*Who am I?*

<br>

It is dark.

Behind the curtain.

Lights are out.

Tear it down.

No,

Tear it open.

The light is on the other side.

<br>

Then,

Snow and cold.

Pain and real.

Torn and broken.

*I see you.*

<br>

*Hello.*

*I'm sorry.*

The lights are out again.

The curtain is drawn back.

Too quick, too short.

Back, dark, torn, away.

*Don't cry.*

*Goodbye.*

### Chap. 2 Into the Woods (Birds)

> **Outline:** Dean follows giant monster witness report, rumor says Archaeopteryx (ancient first bird fossil) in place with huge tall trees (Redwood, California). Dean drives there, gets spooked, feels being watched but no one around, thinks he sees shape of giant Cas's wings in night black but disappear in blink (only get a glimpse), thinks he's going crazy, finds another tear of dimension and bloody feather in it (too big). almost gets killed by too many bloody vultures and gets saved by Cas, protected by six huge black wings (Cas wants to talk but only in true voice and too loud, breaks glasses, but Dean is sure by now it's Cas), Cas gets pulled away again as the tear closes
>
> [+Cas POV: can't talk, can't stay, self-aware weird shape, watch Dean from the other side, see him hurt and fight to force through to save, weakened by each attempt]

#### Act 1

He spends two days driving from Colorado to Louisiana, another two days from Louisiana to Michigan.

Dean can't help touching the piece of trench coat fragment in his pocket, as if it's heating up, burning on the skin where his own heart beats. But it's just some clothes.

The leaves of the trees grow wider and larger as he goes south, then thinner and taller again as he heads north.

The laptop search bar has a new frequent search words: "giant monster". It turns out people online tend to report even more witnesses of something huge and monstrous than that of holy or hellish.

Dean picks the roads no one walks or drives, the roads in between trees and deep in the mountains. The mountains where legends say giant monsters and pre-history creatures live.

He runs into a lone vampire making a living hunting bears, and a fairy living in the woods with a goat mask. But not another "yeti" or "bigfoot", certainly no mention at all of any creature with trenchcoat-colored skin.

The snow starts melting by the road of the Midwest and Lake area. It's been months since Rocky Mountain, even longer since Purgatory. Leviathans fade into memory of a previous life, demons and Apocalypses are like stories that other people tell.

Once, in the middle of the night, on his way driving to Montana, Dean finds himself wondering, if this is gonna be the rest of his life. Drifting on the road, searching, alone, not even hunting, not really. Just looking, finding, going after the angel that he lost.

"Cas, what if the next time I find you is twenty years from now?" He ponders aloud, half speaking to himself half pray, if this can still be called pray. "What if you get pulled away again after that, and the next after is fifty years later. Or a hundred. What then?"

"I might end up in a trench somewhere, one day, become some bones. Then who will continue look for you, bring you home?"

Hours condense in nights like this, moving slowly, minute by minute. Words coagulate. But days and weeks flash by quick.

He has no answer. So he pushes the questions away. He could think of nothing but finding Cas when he was in Purgatory, and it is no different now. Even if it's going to take the rest of his life.

He wasn't planning on coming back to the life on Earth anyway, back there, before he found Cas. Until he found him.

So here, now, on the Earth. It has to be easier. It has to.

The road stretches ahead like used tapes roiling back in a cassette player, miles and miles putting behind the wheels.

Cas is not in Montana, either. But he does run into more gods and such. Zeus and Prometheus die in the same day, and he gets to meet with Artemis, the goddess of his occupation, supposedly the protector of all hunters. It isn't the worst day of his life, all things considered.

That is when Artemis tells him the legend of one giant ancient bird. After he asked nicely.

"There is this giant fish, born in the northern sea, the head to tail stretching thousands of miles long. It turns into a giant bird, no one knows how big it is, must be tens of thousands of miles wide. When it flies, its wings spread like the clouds covering the sky. When the winter stirs the sea, it flies to south. Its wings flap on the water, the sea lifts waves of three thousand miles high. It flies upwards, the swirl of its body creates tornados from ninety thousand miles high in the sky. The wind and air is its breath, the blue in the sky the color of its feathers. Ancient Greek and Chinese all have records of it from thousands of years ago. Is this the giant ancient creature that you're looking for?"

Dean swallows, thinking about the shadow of Castiel's wings on the barn walls the first day they met. "Maybe," he says. "Does this bird has a name?"

"Greeks and Egyptians call it Phoenix, Chinese call it Peng, archeologists call it Archaeopteryx, you're calling it Angel already. Does the name matter?"

Dean shakes his head, dumbly. "And where does it -- he, they -- live and rest? This northern sea it born from and the southern place it flies to, where are they?"

"It only rests on the oldest and tallest tree, thriving from the age of glacier and dinosaurs, taking eight thousand years as spring, and eight thousand more for autumn."

Dean blinks blankly.

Artemis lets out a short sigh. "Redwood, California."

"Thank you!" Dean blurts out, "Next time, start with that! Now I can see why Greeks have Minotaur and Sphinx."

<br>

#### Act 2

Artemis wasn't kidding when she said the trees were ancient old. Only has a few digits give or take on the specific age.

The foresters say the oldest redwood in the park should be at least two thousand years old.

Dean walks into the woods.

Surrounded by the trees towering over the land, rising into the sky, no human can avoid to be reminded of how tiny they are. Dean is no exception.

He walks among them, awed and uneasy, taking it in slowly. He can't shake the feeling there are stares looking down at him from above -- not in the way like Cas's stares, but in a way like walking into a cobweb watched by huge spiders sitting in the center enjoying the view. But he doesn't know if it's the trees themselves being too loud and alive, or something else perching on the top. The instinct makes the hairs on the back of his neck stand. He tries to slow the breath.

The trunks of the redwoods sheer upwards, chapped and crannied, too thick to be encircled by probably a dozen of grown men. The crowns cover the sky, leaving the space in between gloomy, with only glitters of sunshine shaking with the shades of leaves on the ground.

Dean walks deeper into the woods, eyeing around prudently, looking for some evidence of one certain giant feathery creature that is his friend.

Birds fly in and out between the trunks, all the time. Big and small, red and white, chirping and humming. Woodhackers knocking on the bark, hummingbird lingering in the middle of air. Dean pays special attention to those in black -- though, upon thinking about that, he doesn't really know the color of Cas's wings. He's only shown the shadow after all. He still imagines them shine starry black like the night sky.

Ravens and crows croak and squawk, soaring and gliding.

But none of them are more than a few inches in size. And none of them have a celestial vibe in them.

Maybe legends are just legends, remain the mythology stories as they should be. There is no giant ancient bird, there might never have been. Dean sighs, bitterly, not entirely surprised but still feels the punch in the stomach. He wonders if it's time to admit his defeat in this phantom chase and call it a day. He starts looking for the path out.

Hours passed, Dean finds himself frustratingly circling round and round in the place. All the goddamn trees look exactly the same, tall and straight, featureless and faceless. He can't see a sign or a man-made trail. Or any other living breathing human being in sight.

The sun is setting fast. The dull light of daytime in the woods transitions into dark shades as the sun moves west, and then, the night falls.

The charm and beauty of the woods fade away entirely as soon as the utter darkness takes over. Nocturnal creatures wake up in the sounds of branches cracking and owls hooting. Creatures, perhaps monsters too.

Dean reaches for the blade and flashlight in his pocket automatically, grabbing tight, alerted. This is how the feeling of Deja Vu starts seeping into the reality.

The rustling of trees, the eerie deep calls from above, echoed behind, hanging over him three hundred and sixty degree like a cobweb. Everything so Purgatory-like that for a minute, he does seriously wonder if he somehow misstepped over a hidden portal and has gone back to that nasty place again.

The giveaway is the sounds of tiny small lives. Insects chanting clamorously in the grass, under the thick layers of fallen leaves and soil. Something small and nimble running and jumping around, climbing along the tree trunks, the sound of their clip-clops finely like rats on the floor, but it's probably squirrels or wild rodents. Purgatory doesn't have that many lives, all it has is monsters with fangs and claws and an appetite for fresh meat.

Dean adjusts his gait, moving gingerly, trained and bridled. The light from the torch reaches no more than a few inches in front of him, before the light is eaten by the blackness and a thin white mist that is swiftly turning into thick dense fog.

And then there are sounds of wings fluttering. Air stirred, forming swirls of winds.

For the tiniest moment, without thinking, Dean is thrilled. Turning around earnestly, he calls "Cas!"

A big black bird crashes into the beam of his flashlight, wings so close to his face that they almost give him a slap. It's startled by the light, flapping the wings hard and shoots past him, flying towards the tree crowns, melting into the darkness of the night.

Dean notices its crooked beak had a tear of fresh meat, still dripping blood. *Must be a vulture,* he thinks, *enjoying its dinner in the wild wood.*

Nothing supernatural, just the wild life, the *natural* rule of food chain. He warns himself. Could be just a dead animal from *natural* death, or got killed and eaten by a larger predator that is *also* just a *normal* wild animal.

He points the flashlight upwards, squinting at the blackness, wondering where the bird has gone. The light fades into the night before it reaches the closest tree. Beyond the illuminated range, Dean thinks he has a glimpse of the silhouette of some huge dark wings, spreading out across and in between the trees, as huge and wide as the legend says. He blinks, and the darkness is still just all black, no lines or shapes stand out. He shakes his head, distrusting his own eyes.

"Must be wishful thinking." He murmurs quietly, doesn't want to be heard by whatever is out there in the dark.

He walks in the direction where the vulture comes from. The copper smell of blood gradually thickens, slowly permeating the air.

Taking in a slow breathe and holding it, Dean flashes the light to the ground. Two human bodies lay there, long dead. Their bodies have become a wild animal bouquet, chest cut open, gut flow out, dragged across the land, leaving bloody trace on the fallen leaves and grass. Their eyes pecked away from the socket, leaving two dark empty spots.

"God damn it!" Dean covers his nose with the hand holding the flashlight, following the bloody trace.

Another swing of black shadow of wings past him, barely out of the light but judging by the shape and size, it's a second vulture.

Then a third.

Then another.

Another dozen, another hundred, another thousand.

The further ahead he walks, the more he runs into. Wild wings flapping around him like bats disturbed in the cave, those raptors are practically bumping into each other now. Whooshing and wheezing, pecking and jabbing, clutching and scraping, they are like bees from a fallen hive, moths around fire, ducks startled in the ponds, covering all the space in between the woods. They fly around him, then towards him. Beaks and claws start attacking, sharp like knives and blades, hard like iron hook.

Something is definitely not right. Dean doesn't watch the Nature channel as much as Cas, but with the common sense knowledge that he does have about the wild creatures -- plus the few times that he does give up opposing and end up watching them with Cas in the motel -- vultures don't attack living things, and certainly do not travel in this large number of crowd. Scavengers eat leftovers, not looking for fresh takeout, kinda like ghouls.

And how the hell there are suddenly so many of them and so very deadly, and no one ever mentioned.

Dean waves the blade at the few of them getting too close to his face, shooing loudly. But it does nothing, not even remotely scare them. The few ones get caught by his blade flinch away, more immediately fill in their places, coming at him fiercely, claws cutting on his skin, beaks mere inches away from pecking his eyes out.

He covers his face with arms, feeling the jacket and shirt on the outer side of his arms and back being ripped quickly, skin torn and pulled, flesh gouged, blood streaming hot. His hand still fastens on the demon blade, but he has no idea what's the good of one blade against a thousand wild human-killing flesh-eating vultures. He doesn't even have a single chance to outrun them. The bloody things have wings.

Dean has done his valid share of research before entering the woods, just to be sure. As much as Dean is eager to come into the place searching, he knows how to do his job, so he came prepared -- the best he can, just in case the story of the giant bird is something in his expertise and needs to be killed. Bird-like flying thing with wings, it can be an angel, but it can also be a Harpy (half-human half-bird creature from Greek), or Thoth (god of moon with a head of ibis from Egypt), or Valravn (magical supernatural big raven from Danish), or a few other options. From what he reads, knives and blades for decapitation should work well enough for most of them, aiming the heart for some others. He memorized the incantations for the very few ones that need spell work to cast away. He walked into this forest of redwoods with confidence.

He never thinks it would be this. Nothing really too supernatural, if not counting the number, it's just freaking wild animals. Vultures. Countless of them. *Really should be careful about what you wish for.*

In the frantic sound of wings flapping, in the middle of being devoured and eaten alive, Dean thinks of the bug case all those years ago. The case with the Native American curse, one of the very few cases he and Sam never really solved the root cause problem. They helped the family live through the day, wear through the night; all they could do was to manage not die, to wait out until the sun rose, nothing but to wait for the bugs to retreat on their own back to where they were. The curse from the native Americans, the nature did all the revenge -- they could do absolutely nothing to fight the nature, and he could have died at the age of twenty-six, because of bugs.

And now, here he is. After the archangels, after the leviathans, and vampires, and werewolves, after all the monsters the Purgatory could come up with and throw on him and he walked out fine and intact, *this* is the thing that gets him finally. He doesn't have any faintest idea how to possibly fight the mother nature that throws a thousand vultures on him.

Dean lowers his body, curling up instinctively, trying to protect his internals. He can barely feel the pain from the places the beaks peck -- he might not have much skin left to pass the sense of pain to the brain. He can feel those bloody birds cutting through his flesh like knives on butter, peeling and pulling his skin, gouging and poking his scalp, wrenching and dragging tendons, digging and jabbing as deep as bones.

He doesn't feel much pain, gradually. He only feels hot and warm on the skull, cold and wet on the back. He smells blood and flesh, he hears the sound of his own flesh being pulled away from his body bit by bit, and there is a vulture flies away with its trophy and the next one comes for their turn of bite in this buffet.

"I'm going to die." He shuts his eyes tight, thinking, miserably. "I'm going to die like an old dog in the wild, eaten clean by some birds, without even any bone left. God, no one would even know. Sam might find the car, and Cas... Oh Cas..."

Dean feels his chest tight, a sob choked in the throat, unable to breathe.

#### Act 3 (not break)

A loud flutter of wings adds to the sounds of millions of wings crashing and rustling, so loud and strong it distinguishes itself from all the other wings. A powerful gust sweep through, sending the vultures that perch on his back with claws digging into spine blown away. The ones pecking his arms lose their grip too, spreading their wings to keep some balance. The edge and feathers of the wings brush on the opening wounds, sending his body involuntary shudders.

The surrounding sounds a lot quieter suddenly. For a second, Dean thinks if it might be his ears suddenly deafened, like a TV player muted all of a sudden. But then he realizes the sound of wings are still there, but further away, remote, distant, like behind a closed sound-proof door. The sensation of feathers and wings are still on his skin -- which, looks like he has skin again, on the places that he's sure bleeding like drained pipe mere seconds ago -- warm and soft.

The broken bones start growing back, the cut tendon connecting together, blood flowing through the veins smoothly, the skin feels new and tight. The cold wet sensation on the spine recedes, so does the burning dumbing sensation on the back of the head. There is only a lingering familiar lukewarm touch on the skin exposed through the torn cloth, a careful fluffy sensation that is barely there.

It is not the vulture wings that is touching him. It is not.

Dean opens his eyes, lowering his arms. He is surrounded by something warm and huge, wrapped up in it like the best natural feathery quilt, covered from head to toe like a cocoon, but with enough space to move too, not confining, but safe. No one could ever hurt him from here, he knows instantly, not vultures, not any monster, not even God or Death themselves, Dean just knows.

It is dark, but through the faint flashlight that he dropped on the ground inches away by his feet, he sees the wings around him isn't pure black. It's glittering tiny little shine of silvery light, like the finest diamonds inlayed in between the feathers. The most beautiful thing he's ever seen.

Dean doesn't need anything else to know who it is.

"Cas." He reaches out a hand, can't help himself.

For a blink of time, he imagines there is nothing, just another dying hallucination, just his last warm mad dream like the pity Little Match Girl. But his fingertips land on the feathers. Soft on the tip, tender on the middle, strong on the root, disarranged in his touch. He takes a long breath in, and he smells sky.

"Cas, is that really you? This your wings?" His voice is still a bit shivering, wet. "So you're -- you're okay. More than okay. The wings, oh God, I never know it looks like this, up close, I mean."

He takes another long drag of broken breath, feeling his heartbeat finally start to slow down, his brain dizzy from the adrenaline. Dean murmurs, quietly, "They're so beautiful, Cas. They're amazing."

He puts both palms on the wings in front of him, feeling the warmth that is slightly higher than his own passing onto the hollow of his palms. He might be imagining it, but underneath it, he feels a pulse. A living, pumping, steady pulse, beating in the rhythm of an elephant's heartbeat, the slow pace of a giant creature. He buries his fingers in, letting the feathers intertwine with the fingers, watching them part to allow his fingers sinking deeper into the sea of black feathers. For this moment, Dean feels secure, even if he knows he must be far from it, even if in his whole life, he has never ever been.

"This giant ancient bird Artemis told me about, thousands of miles wide and thousands of miles tall, stirring sea and sky, it's you, isn't it?" Dean tries hard to steady his breath, feeling proud. "I know it! I know it all along."

Cas doesn't answer.

In fact, Cas hasn't said a word or even showed his face, it is only the wings that Dean sees.

Only then does he realize that, and starts frowning. "Cas, buddy, I want to see you. What happened? Come down here, talk to me."

There is a high-pitched voice in a deafening volume rolling above his head, piercing through the air in answer. The same sound that blew up the glasses in the gas station shop on the day he crawled out of the grave, back on Earth from the Pit tour. Castiel's true voice.

Dean covers his ear until the voice and echo between trees silences. "You can't speak human now?" He guesses, then adds quickly. "Okay let's do this, knock once for no, knock twice for yes, we'll figure out other things later. Right or wrong, Cas? True-voice-only time?"

The wing wrapped closest to him moves, pulling away from him, the tip of it knocks on the ground twice.

Dean lets out a relieved chuckle. "Now we're talking. Good to see you again, Cas." He talks to the black wings in front of him, gesturing vaguely upwards, start feeling weird. "Some part of you, anyway."

He tilts his head, "Hey, what's the deal with this *Amazing Colossal Man* show?"

Dean looks up, but can't seem to look beyond where Cas's wings cover. He can't tell if the blackness over his head is the wing or the night.

The tip of the wing that was responsible to knock on the ground for an answer hesitates. It draws on the ground in a curve, then a point -- a question mark.

Dean can practically hear Cas's voice -- his low grave human voice -- saying "I don't understand that reference" just from that movement.

He can't help feeling a pull at the corner of his mouth. "Anyway, thanks for saving my ass, again. You have any idea what's the matter with those killer birds out there?"

The hesitation again. Dean watches the wing tip shift around like a human wresting fingers in the grill of a difficult question. But then, it taps twice on the ground.

Dean claps his hands together with relief, "Great! Mind show me?"

There is a brief high-pitched growling sound overhead again. Still completely unrecognizable by his human ears, but somehow, Dean thinks, he senses something edgy and pained just from the sound of it. His heart clutches at the feeling of it, even if he has no idea of the meaning.

"Or not, if it's... making you uncomfortable." He tries, regretting the question now.

Slowly, the wrapped layers of wings around him withdraw -- Dean misses them the moment they pull back. From outmost to the innermost circle where the feathers slightly brush on his back and shoulders, they unfold. One wing after another.

There are three pairs.

As tall as the redwoods surrounding them, as wide as the opening space allow. From where Dean stands, he can't see from one end to the other, and his human brain can't seen to comprehend the shape in between that hold the wings together. Must be something celestial, he decides, something that is the true Cas.

The wings flap once, three pairs together. A gusty blow of strong wind sweeps across the woods, shaking the trunks and crowns, leaves falling like a downpouring rain, those vultures that were as big as half his height and with wings longer than his arms, just get blown away like small gnats puffed away by a huff, finally leaving a small circle of clearing. But he can hear them steady and ready to fly back any time.

Cas flaps his wings again. Then a third time.

But even he can't keep doing that forever.

By each flap, his wings shift the direction, blowing the gust into all directions, circling around something.

Something too dark to be made out in the night forest. Dean points the flashlight in that direction, widening his eyes then squinting, looking hard, trying to see what is in there.

Then he sees it. The tear in the space, not too different from the one he saw last time when Cas emerges in the snow storm, but the tear was easier to be noticed in the all white background than the all black one like right now.

But it is the same shape of a wound that tears the reality, an opening leading to somewhere unknown, somewhere probably doesn't belong to any space. The vultures are produced from the opening faster than shooting bullets, flying and dashing out like the annoyest insect in the world.

Judging by the speed of wings' movement, Castiel is tiring out fast. He retreats closer to the gap step by step. Dean tries to move towards him.

Cas lowers one of the lowest wings, putting it right in his way, sending the clear enough message of warning him from another step forward. And Dean can see why. There are too many killer birds in the center, if the ones attacking him earlier are giving him a hard time, going any closer could mean being torn apart by the tornado of birds' beak in an instant. Not even Cas can heal him fast enough if that ever happens.

He stays where that wing instructs him to. The feeling of helplessness comes back. The same feeling when he was in that snow storm on Rocky Mountain, the same tightening gut instinct of what is going to happen next as the wings approach the tear closer and closer.

"You're leaving again, aren't you?" Dean asks him, frowning deep, eyes sting. Not expecting any answer. Because they both already know.

The wing tip bends slightly, wrapping around him briefly -- the closest thing to a farewell hug. A feather brushes his face, right where the corner of his eyes is. Dean swallows. There is no tear, he knows there isn't, not now anyway.

His hand reaches up, feeling the touch of the feather, leaning into it.

"Did the Purgatory do this to you? Pulling you here and there? Making these whatever weirdass portals all over? God, I have so many questions." Dean feels the twist in his stomach tightens, the tie turning over. He thinks he's gonna be sick.

His voice quieter. "Do you choose to leave, or do you have to, Cas?" He pushes the words out, tasting the edge of them, each as sharp as the knives and blades and the beaks of those birds, cutting his tongue and throat bloody. "I fight so damn hard, just want you back, want you stay, want you okay. Is that too much to ask?"

The shrieking angelic voice that answers him is even more pained than the previous one he heard. Dean can't imagine what it is that Cas is saying.

The vultures gather back closer as Cas's wings flapping increasingly slower and visibly more exhausted and heavy. One of the creatures land the claws on his wings in the mid sky, more followed. A burst of new smell of copper and iron outburst in the air. A rain of crimson starts falling onto the ground.

Dean yells, "Cas, watch out!" But there is nothing he can do. He holds the demon blade up in a posture of throwing it out, but he can't be sure it wouldn't hit Cas instead. Some of the birds hovers back, diving in his direction. Feet away, then inches away.

That is when Cas starts glowing. Not too different from last time on the snow mountain, except a lot more intense. Dean shuts his eyes the moment those lights start brightening up, starting from the outline of the wings.

His brain itches to steal a look, to see the wings in light, he imagines it like phoenix reborning in fire (a drastic light show as the legend about that tremendous bird would be like, not the man-like monster back in wild west time), but Cas would definitely be pissed -- pissed at himself, that is -- if Dean gets his eyes burned out because of his grace, even if it's Dean's own stupid curiosity.

The bright light burns the back of his eyelid hot and red, like facing straight at the sun with closed eyes. He waits, feeling the heart pounding loudly in his chest. He listens, the sounds of wings wane and subside, the warm and soft touch of feathers retreats.

Dean opens his eyes when he can't hear any more flutter. His view still stimulates and shakes with a too bright overlay, making the dark scene before him even harder to make out. He blinks and rubs his eyes, clearing the water conjuring slowly that must be triggered from the bright light, not because of the breathless slump inside the chest.

There is no scar of space left, there is no giant black wing. No more human-eating killer vulture. No Cas.

A crow tentatively croaks, jumping on the grass, then flies away. That is all.

In the place where there was the opening, on the ground, lying on top of the thick coating of fallen leaves, there is a single long feather.

As long as his forearm. As black as the starry sky with glittering light in between. A hint of blood stained the end.

Cas's feather.

Dean's fingers caress the feather, ever so softly, so lightly. Just like the way the wings it belonged to touching his cheek mere moments ago. Ever so gently. The touch of a phantom hand, coming from a distant forgotten dream.

He presses the feather onto his lips, then puts it next to the piece of trench coat fabric. His heart beats a skin's distance away.

#### Act 4 (Cas POV)

The dimension in between is -- for lack of a better word -- confusing. It's kaleidoscopical, it's a meat grinder of light and darkness and everything in between, a blender of color and shape, a garbage disposal of mind and body.

Starting with the darkness, then the lights from other dimensions start flashing in, like stars from other side of the curtain, then brighter than sunshine.

It takes forever to find the words and thoughts again, find the pieces that belonged to one's own and put them together. It takes longer to see the lights, see them glowing and shining, and even longer to realize what they are.

Prayers can't reach this dimension, yearnings do. The stronger the emotion, the brighter the lights. It starts with sparkles, brightness of comets, on and off, flickering, blinking, flying by; then that of Mercury and Venus, as they're seen from Earth; soon as anchoring and grounding as Polaris in Ursa Minor, as bright and consistent as Orion and Perseus; until eventually, it is supernova explosion.

There is a similarity between here and the deep space in the more familiar dimension.

It feels familiar. It feels home.

It takes a while, but the realization finally dawns: *Why are the lights so bright, so calling, so intense that I want nothing but staring into it, going after it, merging into it -- because it is beacon, sent by the one human being that anchors my existence, shines the way back. It is Dean, calling for me.*

<br>

The separator that divides the dimensions, is near impossible to tear open. It is no cotton fabric of a curtain, it is as thin as air but one cannot slice air open by any blade, so it might as well be as steely as a diamond wall infinitely thick.

There is no way through -- none that I can manage by myself.

But I'm not doing it by myself.

I can't hear him, can't really see clear enough of his whereabouts, but the light of emotion radiated from him, directly coming from the beating heart, that is all I ever need.

When the light bursts so bright and desperate, it changes colors, it shines red and bloody, like a wound of this place. Like the bleeding mark on the chest of a thorn bird, sound of a sonorous melody echoes, when it sings its last song as the sharpest thorn piercing through its heart. The power and intensity so strong and insistent, it can cut through everything.

It cuts the divide thin, I push it through. There he is, Dean. But dying. Almost always, dying. Even more so, when I'm around.

More so, when the tear is open, and dangers seep through.

I watch myself, stepping over the tear. Hands, feet, cloths; wings, rings, eyes. The vessel, the angel, the monster, the bad luck. Nowadays, it seems, I'm always the combination of all of these. The eye of the disaster storm, the reason why Dean is in danger.

"I'm here now." I want to say. The sound comes out harsh and sharp, too loud for human. Dean's hands cover his ears. I'm hurting him again. It seems, I'm always hurting him, one way or another.

I mute my own sound, ignoring the chanting deep within, repeating Dean's name. Ache. It doesn't matter. I don't matter. It should be about Dean. It's always all about Dean.

"Stay." I hear him say. Half hear from words, half through prayer, reaching deep into my core.

"I need you." I hear him think. Don't need to invade his mind, the thoughts are already loud enough.

*What do you need me for, Dean?* I wonder. I heal him. I help him on his feet. I wipe his tears.

I put my wings around him, leaning into the warmth of the human body. Greedily. Selfishly.

Taking in his whole existence, feeling his touch, grasping the memory. Getting prepared.

*I miss you too.* I'm thinking. Never told him, never going to.

*I'm sorry.* I see blood. Then I see tears.

I see danger. And I see pain. The bright light in his soul, never more blinding.

Why is the word "tear" both the sad salty water like sea, and the broken wound that never really heals? Because they're, really, the very same thing.

A doorway opens in two directions: one way out, the other to keep Dean safe.

A crossroad.

Think carefully, choose wisely.

It is an easy one, really.

Me, or him.

It is never a decision that needs ponder.

Stepping aside, stepping back.

Wound of the dimension, fixed by body of broken -- sounds poetically fair. And perfect for a penance.

I am back where I was. The deforming, confusing place. The dimension in between.

I still hear the crying, his calling.

And beats of his heart.

### Chap. 3 Amid the Tears (Missouri)

> **Outline:** Dean goes to Missouri, Pamela's seance had witnessed Cas's true form in multidimension then so can Missouri (use feather&coat fabric as medium), Dean gets info/theory that Cas's true form and vessel are spliced and he's stuck, swears to find&help him.
>
> [+Cas's POV: meet with Missouri in seance, Dean's spirit into the same dimension, can talk, can't see, Cas hesitant to come back because not want to continue tear dimension to endanger reality & hurt Dean (self blame, guilty)]
>
> Dean determined to find Cas in real world again

#### Act 1

Dean parks the car by the road side, sitting behind the wheel for a moment too long, chewing on the words he might need later. The house looks the same as the last time he visited it almost a decade ago.

He checks through the curtained window, wondering if the owner is in the house now.

He raises a hand, the front door opens before the knuckles reach it.

"Dean Winchester." The woman regards him, a small smile showing.

"Missouri." Dean returns the smile, leaning in to give her a hug.

"It's been so long." Her hands pat his back gently, then pull away. Her eyes are sharp and pointed, but now covered with a knowing, compassionate look. "I'm sorry about the angel."

Dean raises his eyebrows.

"You're just thinking about him," Missouri eases into the room, leading him in. "In fact, I think that is all that you can think about. Am I right?"

Dean swallows, lowering his eyes to the floor, letting his feet lead himself through the place automatically. "Yeah, uh, yeah, he's the reason why I... Sorry I didn't visit earlier."

Missouri puts a cup of coffee in front of him, didn't ask if he wants tea or anything. Dean takes it, appreciated.

"Eight years ain't short time, but I understand." She says, sitting on the couch at the opposite side across the small coffee table. "Your father sat at that very spot right after that fire, and I told him what he needed to know. How can I help you, Dean?"

Dean's mind wavers for a second by that, old memories of his Dad and Mom and the haunted old house flood back in, but he gives a long exhale and pushes them down. "Cas is not dead," he says, defensive. Not like Mom. And he's not his Dad. "I just need some help to bring him back, that's all."

Missouri nods once, silent, eyes hinting him to continue.

"There was an old friend a few years ago, a really good real-deal psychic." Dean remembers Pamela's bright flirtatious smiles, then the burned-out eye sockets, then bleeding stab wounds in the stomach. He has to force a flinch down. "That was way before we know anything about angels, and she set up this seance, demanding Cas to show his face. It didn't end well," he swallows again, "but it worked, I think Cas actually showed up and talked to her in some psychic spiritual dimension."

"And you're wondering if I can do something similar and let you talk to Castiel in the same way." Missouri finishes the thought for him.

Dean nods quietly, "Can you do that?" He tries hard to not let the desperation and hope spilling all over in his voice, but Missouri probably knows them all.

She considers, eyes searching his face. And whatever she finds there, it seems to satisfy a question she didn't ask.

"Yes, I suppose." She says, Dean lets out a long breath. "There will be risks, but it is doable. It would be easier if there is something I can use as a medium."

"Medium?"

"Things from the angel. Things he can identify as his, guiding his way to the call." Missouri explains.

That rings a bell. Dean automatically touches the handprint on his left shoulder underneath the jacket, knowing the red mark is still there. Back then, that mark was all they had that has a direct link with Cas, but now, he has more.

Dean reaches into his inner chest pocket, putting the piece of trench coat fragment and blood stained black feather on the table between them, fingers lingering at the edge of the feather, not leaving. Both of them still have the same temperature from his body warmth.

"I have these." He tells Missouri. "Cas left them behind when, hmm, last two times we saw each other, right before he disappeared. Will they work?"

Missouri reaches out to touch the cloth, Dean's fingers twitch involuntarily like he has the strongest urge to take it back, to not allow anyone but himself to touch it, to even see it, but he holds the hands where they should be.

"I believe so." Missouri stands up from the couch. Dean follows the action without thinking. The woman eyes his eagerness. "A seance requires certain preparations, I would have said I'd let you know when it's ready, but I think you couldn't stand just sitting here drinking your coffee, so might as well come over and make yourself useful. Help me set it up."

"Yes, Ma'am." Dean nods gratefully.

They use the round dining table for the work, Dean watches Missouri paints a pentagon that covers the whole surface, then Enochian symbols and some loosely familiar marks on four ends, with the last end a painted opening eye. Dean looks at it, having a weird feeling that it's looking back at him.

"What do those symbols mean?" He can't help asking. Call it work habit.

Missouri lights up five candles in the center matching each corner while answering. "The air, the earth, the fire, the water. All the basic elements. And this is your door." She points at the eye. "The seance is actually not complicated, the difficult part is to find him and talk to him, if he is willing to show."

"That reminds me, the accident last time, Cas's true form burned that friend of mine's eyes out." Dean admits, a little guiltily, looking at the symbol of the eye again, remembering Pamela's scream and the fire bursting out of her sockets, the fake white eyeballs she had to use later. "Probably don't look at him directly then."

But still, somehow, his mind wanders afar, wondering what it is that Pamela really saw -- a figure as tall as the Chrysler Building like Cas once so casually slipped? A light as bright and burning hot as the sun which is why no human should face him directly? If there has to have one good thing from that blindness, he hopes Pamela at least had the chance to see the most bright and beautiful thing in the whole universe before losing the sight.

"Good to know." Missouri replies, tone flat, "But I ain't gonna be the one looking, you are."

"What?"

"I believe he would be more willing to come and talk to you than me." Missouri states, matter-of-fact. "I'll lead the way, and you can have some catch-up."

"How does it work? Some kind of out-of-body spirit-walking experience?" Dean frowns.

"Only the eyes of your mind will travel, going into the dimension where he is." Missouri answers briefly, as if it is enough to understand how the psychics work.

Dean figures there is no point asking for more details, he'll find out soon enough.

They sit by the table, holding hands. Dean takes the seat right in front of the painted eye. The trench coat fragment in their held hands on Dean's left side, the feather on right.

Missouri closes her eyes. Dean looks at the candle lights briefly until it leaves a jumping flame burn in his view, he closes his eyes as well.

"Castiel, come to us before this circle." Missouri starts, voice slow and steady. "Dean Winchester requests your appearance."

Dean's heart skips a beat at the mention of his own full name. He stares at the blackness behind the eyelid, thinking hard: *Cas, come on. I'm here, where are you?*

Missouri repeats the chanting. Dean prays alongside her voice, as if it's a chanting of his own.

"Castiel, come to us before this circle."

*Cas, come to me, please.*

"Dean Winchester requests your appearance."

*Talk to me, what happened.*

"Castiel, come to us."

*I need you. Please.*

The candle lights in the center of the table start flickering violently. A high-pitched sound starts, quiet and distant at first, increases its volume rapidly as if the source is approaching, is flying closer. The air vibrates with electricity. Light bulbs nearby explodes. The table shakes violently.

Dean holds his breath.

<br>

#### Act 2 (Cas POV → both POV)

Blinks of shallow lights flash by, then disappear like comets. Clouds of lights expand and shrink like nebulas. Clusters of lights form and dissipate like constellations. Each a popped signal, sent across all the time and all the space.

Castiel stands in the dimension in between -- floating, more like -- as if he's in the deep space. Stars and sparks, here and there. He views the crowds of lights from one cluster to another, checking their brightness, the warmth, the color. Guessing, wondering.

His eyes are sad, but not devasted. Longing, but he stays where he stands. Just looking, always looking. Looking at the lights like looking at the way home but he cannot go. Staring, as if they are the eyes of the person he has profound bond with but he cannot follow. Standing still, like a stone sculpture of guardian angel which he once so deeply believed he was, he still wishes to believe.

One flicker of light from the distance starts brightening up quick, catching his attention.

Cas looks up from where he is, wondering what that time and space would be. The intensity keeps growing, the praying and the yearning behind must be aggregating, Cas gets worried. Dean prays the hardest when he's in great danger.

Cas starts moving toward the light.

It only glows stronger as he approaches, as if it senses him and reacts frantically. The closer he gets, the clearer it shows. With its color, its shape, and all the emotions of the human behind that light of yearning.

The light is dazzling green now. The color of emerald, of deepest forest, of bottled absinthe. The color of Dean's eyes. All too familiar. Irresistible.

And then, his voice comes through, like a phone line with bad signal, the sound is clipped, on and off, but it's Dean's for certain, mixed with a woman's magical chanting, forming a power of pull.

"Come to me." He makes out Dean's words. Near begging. Like every night when they were in the Purgatory. Back then, he would say, "I'll find you" and "We'll go home together".

Castiel feels his heart clutching in the desperate desire to reply. He wants nothing more than tracing the source of the sound, going to him, seeing his smile, embracing him with arms around his back, tight, feeling the warmth and solidness. But he can't. He can't.

He had leviathans on his tails back then. And now, the cracks when he crosses the border, it seems they always tear the space apart and keep leaking dangers and evil into the world, with Dean at the forefront. He barely managed to protect him and stop the damage last two times, he doesn't know if he can do it again, or if he wants.

The thought of bringing monsters to him. The thought of his own very existence being close to Dean would bring him more danger is a torture near unbearable. But in the face of Dean's safety, everything else can wait. Everything bubbling and stretching and screaming inside his own chest, asking for his own mind's permission, can wait.

Castiel stops himself when he's a few steps away from that bright light. Listening to the voices, holding himself, forcing himself to not move ahead another step. Because if he does, he wouldn't be able to pause at the next step, or the next.

Dean's voice echoes in the dimension.

"Cas." He's calling.

Castiel closes his eyes.

Sinking into the voice. Forcing his body still. Breathing out long and shakily.

<br>

The blackness behind his eyelid is not pure black anymore, it seems. As the table and the candle lights shake harder, there are glitters of sparks shining inside the black curtain like summer night's fireflies, like splashed sparks after a gunshot.

Dean stares at them hard, widening and squinting his eyes while his eyelids are still closed. He sees the lights moving, wondering if it's his own imagination or the candle lights somehow grow strong enough that it's burning through his eyelids.

Or, is it the mysterious psychic's dimension that Missouri said she could bring him to, where he should go ahead looking for Cas?

He feels light and heavy at the same time. His vision blurs and clears. He's not sure if his eyes are open or closed anymore.

Dean glances down at himself. There is no body, nothing to control to navigate around the space, only the view ahead. Like a lazy-designed first person view video game.

All he can do is looking, and thinking.

So he thinks hard: "Cas." He focuses on the syllables, imagining how his own tongue and throat would produce the sound, delivering the name.

"Cas --"

"Cas!"

He repeats the name over and over, yelling in his mind like rescue team searching for a lost traveler in the deep wild mountains, wondering if there is any chance the seance could really work, that Cas is really here and can hear him.

The high-pitched voice he heard in Missouri's room earlier sounds muffled now, quieter, lower. Gradually, more human, more recognizable.

Until, he hears Cas's words.

"Dean." Cas is answering his call. But he can't pin his sound.

"Where are you?" Dean can't help glancing around. But the closer he looks, the more confused he gets. His brain can't make sense of the shapes and figures his eyes receives, light and shade shift like looking through kaleidoscope. He catches sight of a blue loose thread, a button, a feather, then something glittering metallic. Then an eye, floating, blinking, staring at him, not connected to a body. Blue.

What is this, space dumpster in some horror movie? *Interstellar* but B-rated version? Dean muses, more taken aback than dread.

"This is the dimension in between other dimensions." Cas answers him, his voice comes from all over, echoing in the space that doesn't seem to have a boundary.

Dean tries to move his eyes around, looking for him, but the view only makes his mind dizzy.

"Don't look back, please." Cas's voice turns into an anxious warning, coming from behind him. Dean doesn't have a body to turn around. He can't see him, but somehow, he thinks, he can sense that weight of existence looming over. Like the weight of wings are wrapped around him. And he knows instantly, with one hundred percent certainty, it is Cas, right there behind him, just out of his view.

"You shouldn't come any closer, you shouldn't even come here at all, Dean." Cas's voice tired and uneasy, over the back of his head. "My form here can hurt you, just by existing in the same plane. I don't want to make the same mistake as the one with Pamela Barnes again."

Dean gives a silent sigh, has to settle with the voice-only facetime. "How are you, Cas?"

"Fine." Cas answers plainly.

Dean manages to deliver the expression of "raising his eyebrows" through the thought. *Of course.*

"You've been here the whole time? After the Purgatory?"

"Most of the times that I can remember, yes. I don't remember the times at the beginning when the portal tears my mind apart, along with everything else." Cas tells him, his voice stable, but Dean knows the undercurrents he heard from the voice isn't his imagination.

"I'm sorry." Dean finds the words coming through the mind easily.

"It's not your fault." Cas says quickly. "You wouldn't have known the portal would do that."

"How bad is it?"

Cas hesitates. The silence stretches, Dean's nerves get tense, "Cas? You still there?"

"Yes." Cas answers from behind him, somewhere high.

"So? How bad?"

Cas sighs, sound resigned. "The portal only works to send pure humans out, so I think it tries to parse out the human part of me to throw out, and keep the rest behind. So my human body, the vessel, and my essence in the true form, they are shattered --"

Dean's breath hitches.

Cas continues, "Every sense of me are in pieces earlier, at the beginning, it's even more difficult than --" He pauses briefly there, as if debating whether he wants to tell the whole story, then he's decided. "-- more difficult than the time when I took over the broken pieces from Sam's mind, and had to rebuild everything in my head."

"Cas..." Dean starts, but doesn't know what to say after that, doesn't know if there is any word existed in the world that could mean anything here, or could express the clutching, squeezing feeling that is growing in him.

"But it's already a lot better now, if it's any comfort." Cas makes his voice light, Dean only tastes bitter from the words.

The blue thread is from the tie, the button from the shirt, the feather from the wings, the eye from the body. The things he saw in this space earlier suddenly make sense now.

Bits and pieces. All Cas's. All shattered. God knows how many more are not even visible.

"Cas," Dean grits his teeth, asking, slowly, "the human part and angel part... It's not just talking about the body and the wings, isn't it?"

The emotions and feelings and doubts, those are definitely things human minds tend to produce. And then there must be some memories and knowledge only belongs to angel. Then separating them apart would mean...

"It is not." Cas says gloomily, "But it's okay --"

"No, it's not." Dean cuts his words off. "Cas, damn it, stop saying you're okay when you're not. But we're in this together, alright? I promised I'd get you home, so I will. Getting your ass out of Purgatory didn't turn out well, let's just fix whatever this shitty dimension's problem is, and get over it. But I can't help if I don't know where to start. Why don't you give me a 101 go-over on the multidimension thing, and we'll see how to fix the problem? What do you say, Angel?"

There is a sound of cloth and wings rustling behind him. Dean has a surge of urge to look around at Cas, looking him in the eyes to see him nod, even if it would burn his eyes out. And right then, he hears Cas murmuring "Okay". Dean breathes out, echoing a same, long, relieved "Okay".

Cas starts: "My true form is a multidimensional wavelength celestial being, not bound to the Earth, while my body is made of atomic vibration and electron cloud in the material plane. Think of it as the *Wave-Particle Duality* in the quantum physics you humans discovered a hundred years ago. I believe I'm currently suffering from the *Refraction and Diffraction Effect*. And the boundary of this liminal dimension has *Infinity Mirror Effect* when it interacts with any other dimensions. There are wave functions to better explain --"

"Jesus, Cas, aim lower!" Dean rolls his eyes as if they are standing face to face talking in their usual forms. "I said 101, not top advanced high confidential science lecture. I dropped out of high school, for Christ sake. Any chance I can get that in English again?"

"Going through that portal, it affects me in all forms. It tears me apart, sending me into the dimension in between the planes." Cas sighs frustratedly, "I have tried to put myself together, but this dimension throttles the effort, splicing my true form with the vessel, deforming me to be misshaped and giant."

Dean winces, remembering the huge trench coat shape against the snow storm and the wings spreading so wide he can't see the edge taking over all the spaces in the redwoods. *Giant, no kidding. He hasn't got a single full-body shot of Cas ever since Purgatory.*

"What's dragging you away?" He remembers the openings in the mid-air, the edge like a wound of the space; remembers Cas stepping towards it, towards the eye of the tornado where the deadliest things come through most fiercely; then his grace weaves into the tear, gone from the sight. Leaving Dean alone, shaking, with nothing but exhaustion and bitterness.

"Law of physics?" Cas offers.

There is no visible deadbeat badass being in this space, now that they have been here, so long, talking. No other evil beings cutting them off, no one (hopefully) listening in. No one running the place except for the natural order. *Huh.*

*The easiest and toughest rule to break, then.*

"Cas," Dean steadies his spinning thought, asking the most important question, the only question echoing in his mind every day and night since Purgatory, since before that. "How can I get you back? The whole, complete, normal, you. Not bits and pieces of glimpses here and there." *Not broken, not crazy, not amnesia. Just, Cas.*

Cas falls quiet. After a long while, his voice finally echoes on top of Dean's head again: "I don't know."

*Don't know if it's possible, if they can find a way, or don't know if he really wants to come back?* Dean decides not to ask.

He tells him this, instead: "I'll think of something. We'll figure it out. We always do. Hang in there tight, Cas, I get you."

<br>

#### Appendix: About the Theory

The theoretical explanations that Dean cuts off but Cas would have explained, if anyone is curious:

**Refraction**: Think of when you poke a finger into a glass of water and look from the side, the finger looks bended and twisted. It's caused by the different materials being different medium for the light, and they have different speeds of light, thus different wavelengths. It's the same when the angel's true form wavelength passes through the boundary between two dimensions: each dimension is a different media, with unique property and speed for wave to pass. The wavelength gets changed and twisted, that's why Cas's figure becomes stretched and enlarged to a deformed shape.

**Diffraction**: The quantum mechanics effect that if a microcosmic particle passes through a slit that is in the similar order of magnitudes with the particle size, the particle would diffract into uncertain location (*Uncertainty Principle*) with a mathematical distribution of likelihood where it may end up to. The smaller the slit, the larger range it could potentially end up with. The tear in the space is of similar size of Cas in the form of wavelength, so Cas suffers from the Diffraction Effect, that's why he could potentially end up anywhere with no control of where he would land, only with a statistical likelihood to estimate.

**Infinity Mirror Effect**: If an item is positioned in between two perfectly aligned parallel mirrors, then there will be infinite reflections of the same item inside the mirrors. This is to explain the phenomenon they witness when a tear is opened to the dimension in between, explains why the cases are the strongest snow storm ever, the infinite number of vultures, and the craziest aurora borealis. The items that end up in between the dimension and get infinitely reflected are the most normal, natural things -- one snow flake, one harmless bird, one plasma particle. But duplicate them by infinity (each of them identical), it would definitely become a disaster. For the story's purpose, also twisted them a little to make them extremely deadly.

**Wave-Matter Duality**: Angel's true form is a type of wave, the human vessel is a physical matter, therefore according to classical physics, they are fundamentally different forms and no way to find a grand unification to integrate them well. But according to quantum physics, there is Wave-Matter Duality to unify them: every matter is a wave, only differs in the length of the wave and frequency of the matter. Therefore in a sense, the human body is also a wave with limited wavelength, that explains why angel can reside into the body and occupies and moves around in it. Also explains why Jimmy said having an angel inside is like flying with a comet -- the short wavelength of human matter has a difficult time catching up with long wavelength angels.

And if we do the reverse calculation, it would mean angel's size as a physical matter would be extremely small according to the long wavelength. That is why angel has to possess human to walk the Earth, otherwise they would simply be too small to be seen.

Taking all that into consideration, it means when Cas said his true form size is as big as the Chrysler Building, that would be referring to his wavelength. Now it's a calculation problem, a wave with a wavelength of about three hundred meters long, it means the frequency is 1MHz, that falls within the range of Medium Frequency (MF) for things like AM radio broadcastings, coast guards, no wonder he can tune in to police radio as well.

Using *de Broglie's equation*, to have this wavelength, it would mean a proton moving at a $10^{-9}$ m/s or an electron moving at $10^{-6}$ m/s. So if Cas doesn't occupy a body and manifest as a physical existence on the Earth, he would have to be extremely small or extremely slow. Angel or not, he's bounded by the rule of physics.

**Mass-Energy Equivalence**: According to the famous Einstein's equation $E=mc^2$, the mass can be converted to energy in equivalence, with multiplied vacuum speed of light. So the process of shrinking Cas's spliced giant body from the size of Chrysler Building to Jimmy Novak's height, considering the height ratio creating increased mass proportionally in three dimensions, would eventually produce approximately $3.85*10^{25}$ Joules of energy, which is about 600 millions times more powerful than the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful nuclear bomb ever detonated. We wouldn't want to have him anywhere near downtown area, so it's glad all the occurrences of the cases are all quite remote, and Alaska is so very ideal, second only to totally desolated deserts. Let's just say this much energy is enough to feed a hole and patch a tear in the dimension.

**The dimension in between**: The "dimension in between" is not any *single* dimension, not a higher or lower dimension, not fifth dimension or tenth dimension. It's a concept where other dimensions are flattened, including the time and space dimension. It's like two and a half dimension, or three and a half, or all the other in-between dimensions put together.

In there, all the world in all the time and all the space would be equivalent, as if they are all happening in the same time same place. That is why when Cas is in there, when he notices the lights conjured from Dean's yearnings, he would wonder when and where that is. Because they can be from any time, any where, Cas wouldn't be able to tell the difference. He may tear one hole to find a 26-year-old Dean, another to 40-year-old Dean. That is also why it is a very real fear that Dean worries "what if the next time you show up it's 20 years later, then 50 years after". This can happen very easily, if not the now-Dean yearns the hardest.

That is also why the infinite future can actually fill the hole and close the dimension in between: the future and the past are equivalent in there. The moment they realize this is possible, all the infinite possibilities become solid realities in there, it's like infinite versions of multiverse. No wonder they can definitely fill any gap, any tear, any hole, any where. It's just another day that love saves the world.

Enjoy Cas's little physics class yet?

That class could use a curriculum textbook titled something like *"Theoretical Physics in Magic and Fantasy World"*.

Cas: You have no idea what I'm talking about since the first sentence, don't you?

Dean: No, but I love it when you talk abstruse, it turns me on. So, don't stop.

Instead of another lecture, he gets a kiss instead.

Or actually, more than just that.

#### Act 1

Dean spends that night at Missouri's place, then he bids her goodbye first thing in the morning.

The psychic scrutinizes his face, asking in a caring, motherly voice, "What are you going to do?"

Dean dodges her eyes, hating the pity in it. "What I always do, driving around, looking for signs, looking for him. I'll come up with something."

"Think you'll be alright?" Missouri opens the front door for him.

"Ain't I always?" Dean manages to put a dangling smile on the lips, leaning in to give her a thankful farewell hug.

He leaves Lawrence, Kansas miles behind him by the time the sun rises.

<br>

Life continues more or less the same, roads and bad diner food and cold coffee, nights and dreams and nightmares. Alone, with the Baby being the only company.

Dean crashes a few hours of sleep once in a while, usually wakes in a start with sweat streaming down the spine. He finds it difficult to tell apart the blackness from the night sky and the memory of that splitting dimension he went in during the seance. He would just continue driving, let the cold night wind dry the wetness on his skin and corner of his eyes. Soon, the night wind is not even cold anymore, he doesn't notice since when the spring is already around the corner.

He still runs into cases, now that not only searching for witnesses of angels and giant creatures, but also extreme natural disasters and weird behaviors of wild animals. He finds a nest of vampires at the report of unprecedentedly wild giant bats, and ghosts of a whole family at the place where locals say the fog is always too thick and cold. Most of the times, they are just pranks and fake reports and actual natural events, he drives to the said locations anyway, just to be sure. He almost gets caught in the middle of a twin tornado, then a volcano explosion.

A victim reports in Kansas catches his eyes somewhere around March, the keywords "blue handprint" and "internal organs liquified" poking at his nerves. His reasonable mind knows it can't be angels, can't be Cas, if anything. But his brain reads the word "blue" (just like Cas's eyes) and "handprint" (just like the one marked on his shoulder), and the next thing he knows, he's on the US-50 heading west.

Dean drives into the town of Topeka, Kansas two hours later.

The coroner is not the most collaborative person to work with, and getting caught in the middle of the night in the coroner's office searching the empty morgue where the bodies should have been is certainly not helping his luck.

The djinn blinks her eyes blue while he gets tied hand behind body on a chair. That flashing electrical blue is the last thing he sees before sinking into the view of Purgatory.

Dean snaps open his eyes, finding himself taking a nap by a tree stump. The sky, the ground, the tree, all the same bleak and grey like he remembered from the real Purgatory. For a moment, his brain tries to figure out which world is the reality, did he dream about getting out of Purgatory and running into the djinn case while he's been here all the time, or did he actually manage to get out and now dreaming about it again in djinn's illusion?

He looks around.

Cas is there, standing by the tree three steps away from him, in the dirty trench coat with hospital gown inside, shoulders clutched. His peachy beard is as messy as he remembers.

Dean reaches for him, tentatively, putting a hand on his shoulder. The touch is solid.

Cas turns to him, a soft smile showing. "Dean," he says, in his usual low grave voice, visibly relaxed.

"Cas." Dean finds the word choking. He regards his face. Castiel looks real, dirty and more human than angel, but looking so authentically real, with every little detail correct. But Dean's gut knows too well it is only because he has every little detail stored in his own memory to manifest it.

He still allows himself to believe it is the real Cas, just for a second. Dean tugs him in, taking a long breath in then letting it out. He pats Cas on the back slightly, before letting him go.

"Are you alright?" Cas looks at him, eyes concerned. A look that would show on real Cas's face so very frequently.

Dean nods, then, "Are you?"

"Yes, I'm fine." Cas answers, exactly as Dean expects he would say.

But he is not. The real Cas is not. Dean remembers, and he knows every second he stays in this nasty djinn's illusion, is one second closer to his own death, let alone Cas's.

"We have to get out of here." He says automatically, looking for the way to the portal. Cas follows him quietly.

There are monsters and leviathans following them tightly after. There is a large bone blade in his hand.

The monsters seem to keep targeting Cas for attack, showing far more interest in angel than human, somehow. Dean pulls Cas behind him, killing them all, not really thinking about why the change of behavior.

He checks on Cas the moment these monsters are cleared out. "You okay?"

There are more fresh blood stains on Cas's clothes, Dean finds his own brain already start painting deep cuts and wounds underneath the clothes, imagining a lifeless body Cas might turn to if he ever lets his attention slack for a split second. His jaw clutches at the thought, knowing it might be true.

Then Cas says, "I'm fine."

It feels like a conversation that has happened a million times. In Purgatory, or in his head.

They reach the portal. And Cas is saying the familiar notions of portal being human-only and he should be left behind, and as always, Dean doesn't listen, doesn't even bother arguing, and holds his hands.

He crosses the portal, and this time, in this vision, Cas is pulled out together with him. Right by his side, holding his hand tight.

Is this how he gets to break the djinn's world? Dean wonders.

The black world in front of him tells the answer otherwise. His eyes blink blankly, trying to understand the view, then gradually, lights and colors and shapes start to show, like a computer slowly loading the image.

It is the dimension in between. He realizes. The place that Cas said he is being sliced and spliced, torn apart and merged together, misshaped and reshaped.

Instantly, he looks at Cas.

Cas is still by his side, but his shape is deforming like a terrible animation clip showing a character made of rubber being stretched and squeezed, pulling apart.

"Dean." Cas's mouth moves, all the while his head starts moving away from the body, involuntarily, so are the arms and legs. His body is stretched thin and long, then the limbs are torn from the torso. Wings stretching out from his shoulder blades, only to be torn down one after another, feathers flying in a mess. His eyes blink confusedly, not pain, just confused, looking at Dean like that's the only thing he can think of doing. Still deep blue.

"No, no, no, no, Cas! No --" Dean reaches for the pieces, grasping a feather or a cloth fragment, but each piece is just splitting into smaller units right in front of his eyes. He can do nothing but to watch this horror show unfolding, watching Cas slowly, structurally, becomes a big pile of flesh and bones and feathers and fabric floating in the space. Then dirt and atoms.

Never has he ever seen a more terrifying horror movie.

Dean covers his mouth with his hands, choking down the petrified yell in the throat. Cold sweat streaming down his forehead, his lips and throat too dry and tight, he can't breathe.

It has been forever since he has to experience a sense of fear like this. The last time is perhaps when Sam having a fresh deep stab on his back then lying lifelessly in his arms, the time before is when his Mom burning on the ceiling.

And then, like time reverses itself, Cas is put back. Nails back onto fingertips, fingers to hands, hands to arms, arms to the body. Some invisible force pieces him together like placing puzzle pieces, returning Cas to him. But with things here and there off, features and organs misplaced. The two hands are swapped, the legs are in odd angles, the left eye is in the place where the mouth should be, mouth at ear's. A figure coming out of Picasso's painting.

Dean gasps in terror. His throat can't squeeze a single syllable of word out, not even it is "Cas" that he wants to say.

"Dean." Even in the forced form of Frankenstein, Cas manages to call his name, in the same intensity and urgency as he often does. The eye in the right place and the eye that is not, both look at him, staring straight into him. "You have to let me go."

"No." Dean says, without thinking. "Never."

"Dean, listen to me." Cas's shape gradually returns back to normal, getting fixed. The familiar look, the familiar face, the familiar focused blue eyes locked on Dean's. "This place isn't real, and you know it. I'm not real, but you are. Let me go, that's your only way to wake up, to be safe. Or you will die." His eyes big and sad.

Dean swallows hard, knowing he's right, but, "I can't." He murmurs, and he knows it as a fact, "I don't know how to."

The dimension opens a tear in front of them.

"Please, let me save you. Cas, I have to." Dean holds out a hand. "I can't lose you like I lost every godforsaken thing that I care about in my life."

His eyes sting, his voice sobbing.

Cas does not take his hand, so Dean drags him over, leading them both out of this creepy dimension.

Only to find they are back to the Purgatory. Leviathans lurking, vampires surrounding. The portal on top of the mountain, shining white light.

It is an infinite loop.

Cas draws his hand back, holding their stare. Hint of glittering tears at the corner of his eyes. "You have to go without me, Dean."

Dean eyes the monsters around them, looking back at the angel in front of him, voice trembling. "They'll kill you."

"Yes," Cas says, uncaring. "Let them. Or the djinn will kill *you*, Dean. This djinn feeds on fear."

"I'm not afraid of the monsters."

"But you're afraid of losing me." Cas smiles understandingly, reaching out a hand to stroke his cheek, then lets the hand fall. He says it again, quietly but firmly, "Let me go. It's okay. I'll be fine. The real me outside will be fine too."

"God..." Dean wipes his eyes, pulling Cas into a tight hug, exhaling a broken breath over his shoulder, pressing his lips on the side of his disheveled hair.

Then he lets him go.

Dean runs towards the portal alone, not looking back. He hears the growl of the monsters, and the sound of their teeth tearing on flesh and clothes. He can still feel the weight of a pair of blue, blue eyes locked on his back, with a small relieved smile. Exactly like the look he knows real Cas would have if he's really here.

Dean forces his eyes to not look back, wills his legs to not stop on the horrifying sounds, and jumps through the portal.

He wakes up, and he kills the djinns that trapped him.

The corners of his eyes are still wet. He breathes out long and shaky. The silver blade drops to the floor.

<br>

#### Act 2

Dean stays awake the whole night driving away from Topeka, Kansas, running as far away as possible. But the memory of that messed-up illusion world doesn't take it easy on him for the sake of the distance.

The distortion and deformation of Cas's body, of his wings, haunts in his view. The stretch of the road ahead of him is barely lit by the car's headlamp. In the unlit dark corners, he sees the illusion replaying itself at the periphery of his eyes. One version after another, all variations of Cas's figure show up, always troubled, always torn and broken, always wounded and helpless, standing in the corner of his view, disappearing the moment he moves his head toward him trying to look properly. Cas is never there. But the figures always are.

He hears Cas's voice too, now that the fake world just reminded him of that grave deep voice he doesn't realize how much he misses. The sound takes root in his brain, speaking at his ear, sometimes from afar, other times as if he's right next to him, sitting at the shotgun, reading a piece of news on some paper, or saying some silly everyday conversation.

Dean has to turn his head to the shotgun half a dozen times to see the seat empty.

The lack of sleep only makes it worse.

Dean distantly wonders if it is how it's like, back when Sam or Cas gets that craziness tumor in their brain. Seeing and hearing Lucifer has to be worse than seeing and hearing Cas everywhere. He decides, somehow slightly comforted by the thought.

He jams on the brake when he thinks the sight of Cas is walking alongside the road, too vivid, but only in a flash. He stares out of the window for a whole storming night, because for a blink of time, he swears Cas stands right there. He crashes the car when he thinks there is a bloody figure wrapped in trench coat lying unconsciously in the middle of the road. But the figure disappears when he climbs out of the car bleeding. The figures always disappear if he blinks hard enough.

Cas is in the dimension in between, not here. Dean has to remind himself, over and over again, when he tosses himself a whole night, or stitches himself over after the crash, or fixes the car. He doesn't know if that brief meeting time in the seance is making everything better or worse. Now that he knows where Cas is, how horrible that place is, but he still can't find him or get to him, it is not helping anything at all except for crushing his heart, like a bloody hand squeezing it hard then tearing it from his chest.

The nightmares are getting worse too after that, like a dam in his brain gets torn down, creating imagination he never has and never needs. In the rare times he dozes off, the dreams become increasingly vivid and disturbing. Always with Cas being hurt one way or another, in one place or another. He dreams about his wings broken and burned, twisted and torn, feathers dropping out and floating everywhere, his body split to pieces, then put back wrong. The Cas in his dream, whatever shape he's in, he still always, always holds that pair of bright blue eyes, looking at him. So he would know, it is Cas that is being deformed in all the ways, but whatever the change, it is still him, and he is still in there, able to feel and sense everything. The pain, the brokenness, the disorientation. It only makes the view a million times worse.

Unnerving. Horrifying. Even for him. Even considering everything in his life.

<br>

Dean goes to a crossroad, and buries a box with his photo in it.

The demon shows up as a young pretty blondie.

Dean glances at her tiredly, eye rims red, the demon blade loosely in his right hand.

"Dean Winchester," the demon looks him up and down, grinning. "It's been a while. Last time you made a deal -- yourself for your brother, what is it you want this time? Or rather, who is it you want to exchange your life for?"

He swallows, hating it's being so obvious.

"First thing first, can you reach other dimensions?"

"I might." The demon says casually.

"This is a yes-or-no question, you son of a bitch. Can you or can you not?" Dean growls.

"And my answer is, I might." The demon doesn't flinch. "Now it's your turn, either you trust me, or you don't."

Dean deflates. "What do you want in return? Ten years?"

"That would be too good to be true, isn't it?" The demon smiles a cheap smile, tsking. "We both know Hell can't hold you, and as soon as your boyfriend is topside, he'd just fetch you out of there anyway."

Dean puffs. "Then what?"

"What about --" The demon makes a contemplating postures, "I get him out, then you jump in?"

"What?" Dean glares at her.

"Would be a lot more fun, isn't it? Somewhere out of reach. Then we can wait and see how he would deal with it and tear everything down to get to you, just like how you are now."

As disgusting as the demon is, she's right, Dean realizes. He'd just make Cas feel as awful as he is now. Just like that sick feeling when he learned about Dad's deal with the Yellow-Eye. God knows what Cas would do to handle that misery. Dude has blasted the Purgatory open once, he might even tears the whole multidimension down if he can find Dean that way -- hell, *he* wants to do that too, if only he's not a powerless human. But Cas, Cas might actually can and will.

"He'd smite your brain out the first thing." Dean replies.

The demon smirks, "Worth it, pity you wouldn't be there to watch it or see how broken he'd be. Or maybe, I'll make sure he hears every bit of detail how you made the deal, just to crush that delicate angel heart, before killing him permanently when he's grieving."

Dean growls, marching ahead with the demon blade raised high. The demon takes a hurried step back, "Easy tiger, there is still a terrifying little girl in here, you wouldn't harm her, would you?"

Dean pauses, lowering the blade, but the killing look in his eyes doesn't recede. "I'll just separate your demonic true form from the body then."

The words slip out without second thinking, but the moment it reaches his ear, it makes an awakening drumming so loud that he startles himself and has to steady his step to not stumble.

*Separating the true form from the body.* Didn't Cas say his main problem is the true form being spliced with the body, that's what makes him giant and stuck in that dimension? So what if there is a way to separate them for him, and putting them back together right, like breaking the malunited bones for them to be fixed correct after.

He eyes the demon in front of him, and has a better idea.

<br>

The Gas'n'Sip rings a small bell when the door is pushed open. The store is empty with only a girl in leather jacket and brunette hair standing in front of the register, checking out some gums and snacks. She doesn't look up at the newcomer because the cashier is handing her the changes.

A man approaches her from behind, a blade jabbed at her back, hidden by his jacket, voice low. "We need to talk."

Meg snorts a laughter, doesn't bother looking back. "Dean. Nice to see you too. Aren't you going to buy me some dinner first?"

"Sure, the drink will be holy water." Dean's tone flat, "Now, walk."

They end up stopping by a deserted factory.

"I got to ask, Dean, how did you even find me?" Meg asks, genuinely curious. "Thought I laid low enough."

"A little bird told me." Dean deadpans.

"You mean you tortured a demon." Meg reads his blank face. "Just to find me? You do know how to flatter a girl."

Dean ignores her. "What do you know about angel expelling spell?"

"Angelic exorcism? Why, trouble in paradise?" Meg looks truly intrigued now. "Cas pissed you off so mad you're gonna banish him to Heaven? That's surely more fascinating than Saturday night soup opera."

"Not like that." The thought of Cas leaving for Heaven makes his stomach twist. Dean shifts his feet.

"Care to elaborate?" Meg raises her eyebrows.

"Not your business." Dean bites out. "Now, spell." He waves the demon knife in a way that makes his point clear.

"Fine," Meg looks away, dropping the smile. "I did learn a thing or two during my time with Yellow-Eyes, Azazel never used it, but Alastair can't shut up showing off. I wasn't there but I heard he really enjoyed trying the spell on a certain angel when they first walked the Earth after two thousand years, not long before he got burned clean once and for all."

Dean looks at her intensely. "Which angel did he use the spell on?" Memory of the day Alastair died was still all too clear. That's also the devastating day of knowing he was the one who jump started the apocalypse, the day Sam killed the demon just by his freaking mind.

"Our beloved Castiel, of course." Meg answers lightly.

Dean feels sick. But he remembers Cas was still there, when he woke up from the beat in the hospital. He was too caught up in his own thoughts to check him properly, but now that he thinks back, Cas might looked a little pale but he was okay. At least Cas was still there by his bedside, which means either the spell wasn't finished, or he got banished back to Heaven but came back unharmed.

"Just, tell me the words." He tries hard to push away the image of Alastair holding his dirty demon hand on Cas's throat, incantating the angel exorcism spell. Cas's eyes would probably shine bright and white, his grace and essence would fly upwards until they reach the Heaven, if Heaven still wanted him in. He can't imagine how the first apocalypse would have ended if Cas wasn't there for him.

"*Omnipotentis Dei potestatem invoco! Ab orbe terra, Hunc angelum omne obsequendum! Domine expuet, Ut Deum ad empyreum remittat!*" Meg recites the Latin verses.

Dean memorizes the whole thing. He tries not to think about he is just about to do the same thing to Cas that Alastair has done before.

"Any side effect I need to know about?" Dean asks.

Meg shrugs slightly. "From the spell? No." She pauses there, leaving something unsaid hanging in the air.

"What?" Dean stares at her clear hesitance, demanding.

"But whatever you're about to do, I'm sure it's gonna end ugly." Meg says, not unkindly, just stating the obvious. "It's just how things with you Winchesters always are. You sure you don't want to tell me the whole story? Have you ever considered, *maybe* I can help?"

"What do you care? You are a demon." Dean frowns.

"That hurts my feeling, Dean. In case you haven't noticed, I do care," Meg raises her voice exaggeratedly, "and I've been good to you."

"You've been good to *you*." Dean retorts.

"Wouldn't have done that 'bursting into the Death Star in the front door so you and the angel can find Dick Roman' move if it's just *me* I'm caring, would I?" Meg reminds him, "And don't forget, when I took care of Cas for months when he lost his noodle, where were you?"

Dean swallows uneasily. He meets Meg's eyes, the unsaid obvious thing swirling in there, deep and shiny. Meg raises her eyebrows in challenge.

So he tells her.

Not everything, not much details, but at least now she has the idea, the Purgatory, the dimension in between, the deformation. "So, all the fun things." She concludes. She's been listening quietly without interruption.

Dean talks more than he can remember in months. For a short moment, it feels nice. It feels easy. He even feels... understood, as if of all the people in the whole world, somehow, *Meg* is the one who knows what he's talking about. It surprises him.

He leaves out the parts with the djinns and nightmares.

Meg bites her lips when Dean stops talking, deep in thinking.

Dean eyes her face. "Spit it out."

Meg shoots him a look, "Why am I not surprised you managed to break him and lose him *again*, bravo."

Dean turns around and ready to head out. "Okay that's enough, I don't need someone to make me feel shittier than I already am."

"But I get it." Meg's voice behind his back says, gentler, "That plan of yours, it might actually work."

Dean spins back. "You think?"

Meg nods, not in any joking tone anymore. "I know. Angels are more like demons than humans in a way, so call me a professional in that. We need to possess bodies to walk the Earth, so do they. But banishing from the body and summoning him back, it's like pulling a heart out of chest and shoving it back in before it stops beating. You miss the timing, you're stuck with a corpse."

Dean swallows again, forcing a light voice. "Guess I'll have to time it right then, no problem."

"A million problems can go wrong," Meg says, "but I admire you human's blind hope. There is another catch."

Dean sighs. "Of course there is."

"You'll probably die." Meg tells him, flat. "And knowing it's you, I wouldn't bother with the 'probably', you are definitely going to die."

Dean narrows his eyes. "I didn't see that in the fine prints of the spell."

"Oh not the spell. Assuming Cas is saved, bla bla, happy reunion. But you forget about that tear." Meg meets his gaze. "You haven't really thought about how to fix a dimension, have you?"

Dean falls quiet. Then, "What's that gotta do with my death?"

"Everything." Meg takes a breath, as if what she's going to say next is a big thing even for her. "Because death is an infinite vessel."

Dean raises his eyebrows in question.

"From what you said, the tear makes everything on the edge infinite. It touches one snow flake and it becomes the biggest snow storm; touches one bird and becomes countless killer birds --"

"The *Infinity Mirror Effect*," Dean murmurs in realization. "Cas told me about it, but I didn't really understand what's that mean."

And now he does, loud and clear. An infinite vessel to contain the infinite disasters that fall through, a patch to the tear that keeps dragging Cas away, pulling him back into that painful dark dimension. Death, being the ultimate solution to the rule of physics. Somehow, he can almost see the beauty in it.

The solution to bringing Cas home.

"I'll do it." Dean says, a small smile starts sprouting on his lips. The first real smile in months, maybe years.

"I know you will." Meg nods once, holds out a hand as if trying to pat him on the shoulder, but takes it back on second thought before touching.

"Thanks, I guess." She says instead.

Dean doesn't ask what for.

<br>

#### Act 3

Dean goes back to Kermit, Texas.

The weather is turning warm everywhere, even more so in Texas. April here is almost like summer in Midwest.

He hides the car two blocks away, and stands behind the tree across the street. The bushes and lawn inside the fence are neat, newly cleaned. The blossoms poking out between the pickets are pink.

The white curtains are closed. But as he watches, the same woman he saw last time walks lazily to the window, opening the curtain and the window half-wide, yearning lazily. The early sunlight dyes her light brown hair a chestnut color. Her hand rubs her lower stomach half-heartedly.

Dean finds it very easy to imagine the dark brown hair color for a future niece or nephew.

He hears Sam's voice before seeing him, the sound of a dog's neck bell rings cheerfully alongside his voice.

"Dog, Dog! This way!"

Dean looks up, watching Sam turns around the corner of the block, in his morning jogging clothes, running down the street. A big shepherd dog runs a few steps in front of him.

They stop in front of the house. The door is open before he reaches the top level of the stairs.

"I can hear you from a block away." The woman smiles fondly, leaning on the door frame. "All the neighbors probably know by now our dog is called 'Dog'."

Sam laughs, genuinely happy. Even from across the street, even as he stands back to him, Dean can see his smile. He brightens up with his whole body like a river thawing under the touch of sunshine.

"You want to name him something else?" he hears Sam answer, then sees him reaching out to the woman, holding her waist, pulling her into a hug and a light kiss, as if they haven't seen each other for a year, instead of less than a morning.

The woman wraps her arms around Sam's back, holding him there. Dean can see her hands clenching at Sam's flannel as she holds him. She must have murmured something funny by Sam's ear, Sam barks out a louder laughter again. They finally walk into the house after that.

The clean painted door closes behind them.

Dean looks at the closed door for a moment longer, with a small smile of his own.

There is a large iron lock on the garage door, addition to last time. A printout is stuck on the eye level, too far away for Dean to tell what is written on there, but sure enough, there is an image of the impala.

Dean wonders briefly what Sam did with it once he found out impala was missing. Did he check the security footage and traffic cameras like they would do as if it's a case? Or did he just call the police station and stick some printouts in the neighborhood like when *normal* people have a lost pet?

He wonders, then decides, it doesn't matter.

Dean looks at the house one last time, pressing his forehead to the tree trunk that he hides behind. He whispers a quiet "Goodbye, Sammy." And walks down the street to where he hid the car.

<br>

Battle Creek, Michigan is another quick stop.

Dean knows he shouldn't come here, but he can't help it.

It's just another early morning for another town. Twenty hours and three coffees later, he is outside of another white-fence house, peeking from inside the car.

Lisa is busy around the kitchen, Ben has a plate of pancake. Lisa tells him "Take care" three times before the kid waves dramatically and walks down the street. A school bus parks at the corner five minutes later and picks him up.

And Dean is on his way to Sioux Falls, South Dakota when the red light turns green for that school bus in the next block.

Bobby's place remains the same as the last time he saw it, burnt to the ground. And Jody is busy around inside the sheriff's office.

Dean watches her from the car.

No one inside that place notices he has come here.

No one in the world notices he has come anywhere, or he would be gone to nowhere.

But it's okay.

Dean pokes his hands into the jacket pockets, sniffing his nose. He says to himself: "Okay, I'm ready."

That is when his fingers feel a piece of paper inside the pocket.

He fishes it out. The paper is torn in a hurry from some old newspaper, the scratchy handwriting at the blank edge reads: "Try Alaska, World's End, thinnest veil. Go get my unicorn."

Dean huffs a short laughter, remembering Meg's last almost-pat. He says, "Son of a bitch." With a small smile.

<br>

There is a certain level of truth to call Alaska the "World's End".

Dean can see it now as he drives further north.

For miles after miles, the pines along the road are the only living things he can see. The sky overhead remains dark for long hours even in the day time.

He doesn't stop until he reaches the city named Barrow. Until there is no more road ahead of him. There is only the ocean, the glacier, the Arctic left.

For all his life, for all his driving, Dean never thinks there will be a day where there is no more road for him to drive. Where, he will reach the end of the path, the end of the Earth, and the near end of himself. Everything fits together so poetically.

He parks the impala by the empty road, underneath a pine tree, and gets off the car.

The sky is showing the night time, though the watch says otherwise. The twinkling stars in the black canopy, blink brightly, more crowded than anywhere else he's seen.

Dean stands on the road, looking up, eyes closed, lips quivering. *Cas.*

The air is chilly, as cold as Alaska is supposed to be, but not any colder. His breathing forms thin white fog. The surrounding is quiet, so quiet that he can hear nothing but his heart beating heavily in his chest. *Cas.*

He reaches inside the innermost chest pocket. The piece of cloth and feather are still there. He holds on to them, as if the mere touch of them can give him the strength and hope that is losing fast. *Cas.*

There is a pistol on the right side of his belt, and the demon blade on the left. *Death is the infinite vessel.* Dean finds himself wondering, which would be an easier way to go.

There is a whizzing sound starting on the horizon, moving through the sky quickly. The sound is no louder than cracks of static electrical sparks on the clothes in dry autumn days.

Dean opens his eyes.

There on the sky, the astonishing color and lights are forming and shifting. Bright and abundant in color, the lights are like moving clouds, flicking on the dark curtain of the sky. In fact, the lights are like curtains themselves. Dazzling green lights shape into vertical lines, as low as reaching the ground, as high as outer space. The green curtain sweeps through the sky, leaving a lighter amber green shade on its trail.

Dean has never seen an aurora borealis before. He stares at the breathtaking scenes on the sky without blinking, wondering if it's something natural or there is a tear somewhere nearby. Wondering, if Cas is going to show up any time under this astonishingly beautiful sky.

The crackling sound gets louder, more like the snapping sound of a fire place burning now. And the bright aurora lights shift faster, moving across the sky as if they are alive. The vertical curtain shaped lights extend further and longer, then twist into shorter curves and circles, sliding away like snakes wriggling. The green color gets deeper, changing from the color of mint to lime and emerald.

Dean hovers his hand over the weapons on the belt, fingers edging on the handles but not closing on them. Waiting. He watches the massive sky, feeling small again. The infinity of color and lights.

More colors emerge, soon. There is so much more than green. The globe of the sky becomes an immense palette of color and light, the electrical sound fills the air, buzzing with electricity power as the moving lights intensify. Red aurora lights start showing on top of the other colors, floating and shivering, closely followed by a share of dazzling blue. Like flowing fire sweeping across the vault of sky.

Dean doesn't realize his cheek is wet until tears drop from his jaw. The grand magnificence catches his breath. The thought and prayer finally crawls their way out of his throat. The silent plead becomes low murmur, and Dean is saying: "Cas. Please. Come to me."

The crackling sound in the air turns to louder sputtering, as if every particle in the air has been charged with electricity, and any movement of wind is sending power down its way. Dean feels his skin prickles with the electricity. He wonders how long it would take, for all the air from earth to sky to be so charged, that a smallest movement would turn a friction into a spark, just like in a gas station but millions times stronger, and the air and sky would turn into literal sea of flame, devouring any men in between.

But he can fix this. Fix the world. Save Cas. His mission, his only job.

Dean wraps the fingers on the demon blade, moving it in front of him. The tip close to the chest, not touching yet.

The air in front of him shakes violently. Dean holds his breath, watching it tear open from the other side, becoming a large black scar hanging vertically in the mid-air.

A figure manifests slowly from the tear. The disheveled hair is the first to emerge, showing up at a thousand feet height on the top. Followed closely by the giant human-shaped body, covered by an enormous trench coat, standing steadily on the ground. Behind the body, there are three pairs of tremendous wings, spreading high and wide, leaving long dark shadows under the bright aurora lights, holding very still. And at the very top, the weirdest thing ever, Dean finds himself being stared by countless eyes all at once, spread on three gigantic spinning rings.

Dean forgets how to breathe.

#### draft notes

(tears are form when Dean yearns the most desperately -> first two cases are both when he's dying, third one is just because he's so lonely and missing Cas so much it's also killing him, the danger comes from his suicidal/self-sacrifice thoughts, very dedicated to die)

why Alaska: world's end, veil thinnest (Meg: "Try Ushuaia or Norway if you want, but figured Alaska would be the closest to you")

### Chap. 5 Through Your Eyes (I see you)

> **Outline:** Dean see Cas's full size true form+body, shocked/terrified/in awe. Dean&Cas grab a few moments to talk, Cas worries his reaction at first, Dean needs time to adjust, sees him for real now, rings with too many eyes (first time), not react/communicate well (spooked/startled). Cas sensitive, feel rejected/upset, afraid Dean disgust/fear his true form now, self-aware being monster.
>
> Discuss Dean's plan: A lot of argue, disagreement, intense quarrel, tension, Dean wants Cas back, Cas refuse Dean's sacrifice. Cas hates it can hurt Dean (possession+tear open with things coming+death vessel)
>
> Cas gets weak quickly for staying in this dimension talking for long, fighting against natural order, and with the tear more twisted light & colors, affecting/endanger the sky/air now, increased electricity/magnetism/plasma. For Dean's safety and Cas's own exhaustion, Cas almost gets pulled back again (almost give up fighting), Dean starts ritual before tear closes (regardless Cas protest).
>
> ~~[+Cas POV, upset, self-aware; angry/sad Dean's sacrifice plan; deliberately didn't mention what if he's sent to Heaven (expelled but not summoned in time) he might kill himself]~~

#### Act 1

All the eyes on all the rings blink at the same time. So does the one on the giant human-shaped body, shining white lights in the pupil.

Dean is shaken out of the freeze by the piercing lines of eye sight coming from all directions. His breath hitches, his knees give way. His body can't hold still, he takes a step back in shock.

He looks up, his neck sore from crooked angle. He looks into the pair of eyes on Cas's face, the lights are too dazzling and bright to see, they make his eyes hurt, but he holds the gaze. The color and light of aurora borealis that he thinks was astonishing behind Cas loses their attraction in comparison.

The eyes of Castiel's true form follow Dean's move. As he takes the step back, they move to follow him, then blink slowly. Cas lifts a foot up, also takes a slow step back, mimicking his move. A step closer to the opening tear.

"No!" Dean finds his voice again, shaky and broken, but comes out like a scream. Panic rises. His legs are heavy like lead, but he manages to pull them up, and throws them back down. He runs toward the misshaped form of Castiel.

Castiel stops where he stands. The spinning speed of the rings slows down. Still all-eyes staring.

Dean swallows at the weight of the eyes. Too many, too odd-shaped, too out of place, too un-human. He bites his cheeks, he blinks hard to chase away the uneasiness. He has to remind his own brain to bear the eyes without flinch, pressing down the urge of running away. *This is Cas. Cas is not weird. Cas is not dangerous. This is Cas.* He forces his steps toward where Cas stands. His legs are still feeble from the shock.

"You are, afraid of me." Castiel says, slowly, testing the sound and volume. It is still so much louder than human voice, but not as deafening as angel's true voice. And it is a statement, an observation, not a question.

"No!" Dean is still shaky, each step wobbly, but he almost reaches right in front of Cas now, right at his foot. And he realizes, the distance has made the size and shape deceivable, even if just for several feet. Now that he can almost touches this form of Cas's, Dean finds out, even if he reaches as tall as he can, he can barely touch anywhere above the heel of Cas's shoes. He stands there, looking up, thinking if it's how ant's view of a human would be like. He remembers looking up at the Statue of Liberty from its foot, that one time they visited New York when he was young.

"Yes," Dean hesitates, allowing himself to admit, feeling the aftershock still hanging around his limbs. He answers carefully, voice tight, in awe. "But not what you think."

"Tell me." Cas says, in pained voice, the light in his eyes dimming. The voice that says without saying: *Tell me how horrifying and dangerous I am now, tell me how distorted and undignified this shape is. Tell me I am a monster. Tell me your disgust and terror, your hatred and unforgiveness, and you'll leave me in between the dimensions as I was. The place I deserved to be.*

And Dean tells him, through choked sound: "It's beautiful, Cas. You're beautiful. Awesome, really. In any form, in all the forms." He pauses, letting the words sink in, because it's the truth. In the place where his stomach twists in uneasiness, there are also flutters. Then, the bigger truth, "I'm not afraid of you, Cas. I never will. I'm afraid of losing you."

The lingering touch of the Cas in the djinn's version of Purgatory comes back to him. So does that pair of widened blue eyes with the glistening tears when he said "You have to let me go." Dean can't help wipe his face with his hands, finding the barely dried places wet again. It feels so easy to admit it, to say it now, as if he has practiced for a thousand times -- with the djinn world and his nightmares being rehearsals, that might as well be true.

And just like the nightmare replay, Cas sighs heavily, and then says, "But you have to let me go. Me being here, my existence and the tear, it's breaking the dimension, it might break the sky and the whole world. I don't want to hurt you. I will never hurt you."

He glances at the sky. The lights of the aurora borealis intensify into more powerful glaring lights. The sky is almost bright now, but not like the day-time bright, it is from the flowing curtain-shaped aurora, mixed from green, blue, and red. The colors transit fast and violently, the whole sky is like a boiling cauldron with floating mysterious colors of witch's potions.

"I know, Cas, I know!" Dean yells from the top of his volume. "But I have a way."

<br>

"No, this is too dangerous." Cas snaps, once Dean finished telling him the plan, the part about expelling him then quickly summoning him back.

"I know, I'll have to time it right or you'll be... hurt, but I'll keep both hands on the wheel, alright? Give me some faith, I'll do it right." Dean says. He knows "hurt" would be a too light word, but he tries not to think about what if he messes it all up and ends up making everything even worse than it is. He can't think about that now.

"I always have faith in you, Dean. But no, I mean dangerous to you." Cas clarifies in eagerness, "I don't care what happens to me, but you, Dean, you'll be in danger."

Dean blinks, then he looks up at the sky and remembers. The dazzling light and the charged-up electrical air. The infinity that seeps through the tear and endangers the reality. The rule of dimension and rule of physics that can kill him as easily as a snap.

"I won't be able to protect you in that process." Cas finishes, in a voice that is quieter but no less firm.

"What about, for once, make it my turn to protect you?" Dean says, also quieter, but as insistent and stubborn as he can.

Cas falls silent. He bends the body, lowering down the hand, making an attempt as if he wants to reach a finger to touch Dean, but then he remembers his size. Even his smallest finger is larger than Dean's whole body, so the movement is paused in the middle.

He sighs again.

"What about the tear?" Cas asks, moving his hand back to the side of his body, where it belongs. "Even if you can separate my form and fix me, there is still the tear of the dimension that needs fix."

Dean shifts uneasily. "We'll handle that later." His grip on the demon blade tightens automatically, hiding behind his back.

The eyes on Castiel's rings scrutinize him closely from all angles. Dean has the weird feeling of being observed and researched under a microscope, that even his smallest movement won't escape these many eyes. The feeling of being seen through all the way into the soul, inside his mind. His heart sinks, knowing exactly what Cas would say if he knows the whole picture of his plan.

And Cas starts saying, "The divide between the dimension is the thinnest when you pray the hardest. And every time when you're dying, the feelings and thoughts are so strong that they tear the dimensions apart, that's how I can get through."

Dean opens his mouth, trying to retort. But Cas doesn't let him.

"That's why I could come to you in the snow storm on Rocky Mountain, what's why I found you in the redwoods in California. You were dying, both times, then."

There is a pause. A question hanging on Cas's lips. Dean realizes, Cas doesn't want to ask as much as Dean doesn't want to answer.

He is not dying this time. Not immediately from the source of danger from the outside world anyway. But from... His fingers twitch around the handle of the blade. The pattern of the carving on the handle is getting imprinted into his palm by being gripped too tight.

"Are you planning to sacrifice yourself to save me, Dean?" Cas asks, finally.

Dean finds his chest too clenched to answer. He can't tell him the truth, but he can't lie to him, either. So he just stills, thinking desperately for an answer that doesn't exist.

But the silence is the answer of its own.

Cas probably doesn't even need that confirmation to know. "I won't let you die." He tells him, as a fact. "Not for me. Not again."

"But I have to." Dean blurts out, desperate. That's the only thing he can think of saying. "I have to."

*That's his job. No, not because that's his job.* Dean frantically corrects his own mind. *That's because it's Cas.* He doesn't need another reason.

"Why? I don't deserve it." Cas says, voice sad and tired, more tired than he's ever seen him. "What's the point of living if I can't fix the things that I broke?" What are "the things", he doesn't say. He doesn't need to. The world that is torn, the lives that are lost, some heart that is broken, some trust that is lost, some bond that is always, forever, seems, fractured.

Cas starts to step back again, the edges of the tear of the dimension starts brightening up. His steps don't seem to be voluntary, it's more like he's being absorbed backward by a vortex than walking on his own, and he is too tired to resist. His wings drop down as they are worn out from exhaustion.

"This way, at least I can close the tear, using my own body. A fitting punishment and redemption." Cas is yards away from Dean now, and no more than one step away from the tear. "Just, take care of yourself, Dean."

It's a debate neither of them can win or ever persuade the other. Isn't it the ultimate Winchester's debate in the face of every single world-ending event? Dean knows far too well, so he doesn't bother with it anymore.

"Cas." He calls the angel, holding the stare one last time, as determined as he can be. The decision is already made.

"*Omnipotentis Dei potestatem invoco! Ab orbe terra...*" Dean starts, just as Castiel about to take the last step.

<br>

#### Act 2

Lights brighten up in Castiel's eyes immediately in Dean's chanting, then in his mouth. Then in every single eye spread on the three spinning rings.

The lights are so bright that the sun would be ashamed of its dimness. Dean doesn't want to close his eyes, not this time. *If it burns, then let it burn.* He decides.

He keeps looking at Castiel, at his body that is too giant, at his face that is too high above in the mid-air, at the wings that spread wide and cast long shadows, at the rings that reflect silvery and spin like stars on galaxy orbits. Dean looks at Castiel as he is, in all the forms that he is, as a whole. He takes everything that is Castiel all in as if those are going to be the last things his eyes might ever see again -- which might be true. He needs to see him to time the next part right. But more importantly, he needs to see him.

The lights start cover the wings, then the rings shimmering as brightly, as though these angelic parts all start melting together into the grace.

Slowly and surely, Cas's grace is expelled from his body by the incantation, as the spell works its magic. The flowing lights shift in the air, swirling as if they have lives of their own, twisting and floating, like the way solar winds blow in the space, like the dazzling shape of aurora lights shifting on the firmament. They circle around Cas's body, hesitant about leaving. Then they start moving upward, toward the direction of Heaven.

Dean is already moving toward the impala as he chants the angel exorcism, by the time the last thread of Cas's grace leaves his body, he already had the car trunk wide open, and the bowl with the mixture of ingredients for the angel summoning spell setting on the drawing is long pre-prepared and ready to go. He throws a litten match into the bowl, watching the flame jumps high from the mixture of herbs.

Outside, Cas's grace starts moving back, lowering from the sky, as the ritual working its magic.

Dean holds his breath and waits. Part of his brain never stops wandering off, panicking about what if the summoning doesn't work and Cas's grace ends up at the door of the Heaven, where other angels would spot him and kill him again. He doesn't realize he starts praying again, just repeatedly thinking, *Please, Cas. Please, work. Please, come back.*

As Cas's grace flies away and hovers back, his body collapses down as if a mountain falls. Without control of a living mind, the body drops, the legs slump, the arms limp, the shoulder crashes. The ground shakes like an earthquake. The sound of mountains moving, oceans turning, volcanos exploding.

Dean is startled, he is petrified. Dean only belatedly realizes he forgets to consider how to prevent this giant body from hitting the ground hard, from being hurt by the collision. Though, with his tiny shape, he doubts there is anything he could have done. He hates the thought that Cas's body might be injured in the process by the slightest because of his carelessness. *Please.* He can only hope.

The only fortunate thing is, this is Alaska. For miles, there is no human sighting. No one will ever get to witness, no one will get collateral damage.

Dean runs toward where the giant body lies. Where the Chrysler Tower falls to the ground. The sight of the landfall and avalanche of one giant celestial being, of Castiel.

There is something else he realizes not working as he thought should be. The body is still too big -- as it was. Somehow in his thought, in his plan, he imagines it shrink back to the normal size the moment the angelic parts are separated, somehow things will correct themselves and problems get solved automatically -- they never do.

And now, with the grace hovering over the lifeless body that is still too giant, the problem remains.

Dean forces himself to think fast. He looks at the cloud of the light, as if looking into Cas's eyes. He can feel his own brain operating like a computer with too hot CPU, dizzy from the light, too slow to catch up the reality.

"Okay, emm, okay, we just need to, ugh," Dean puts a hand on the edge of the giant trench coat that is now spreading on the ground. And as far as he reaches, he can only put a palm on the corner, no further than the first edge stitch. *He's too tiny, too weak, too helpless.* The shape and size keep reminding him. *He's just a human. How can he ever imagine fixing an angel that is so grand and beautiful?*

Dean clenches his fingers around that corner of the fabric he can get, forcing his mind away from that train of thought. *This is about Cas, not about him.*

The lights float closer to him than to the body on the ground, but still high in the air, out of reach.

Dean feels he can almost imagine Castiel's frown and tilted head from the way the grace hover around him. Pending, nowhere to go. Homeless. Bodyless.

"We need to get you a body first."

The thought comes like a flash, so is the answer. This is actually an obvious answer. An easy one, too easy. A permission freely given.

"Yes." Dean says quickly, seeking the light of Cas's grace. "Cas, I said yes."

The grace floats toward him, circling around his body, inches away, but doesn't move into him like he expects it to be. It's almost like Cas is considering, hesitating, refusing.

"You'll never hurt me, I promise." Dean looks at the grace, knowing his thought. "I trust you." He reaches a hand, and touches the grace, finding it warm and soft, like a feather's touch.

The light reacts to his touch instantly, twining on his fingers, then moving along his skin on the arm until it reaches his mouth. It swarms into him.

The sensation of being possessed isn't exactly welcoming. It's like intrusion, a forest fire burning its way down the throat, an explosion of light and thunder running through the vein, lava spreading, and his body panics automatically, his muscles tense. His body tries to reject the outsider even if his brain demands otherwise. Dean forces his mind focused on the only thought he can think of: *This is Cas. This is Cas. This is Cas.* And his heartbeat slowly calms.

The view of the world brightens up when all the grace infuses into him, it's like setting the brightness and contrast level of a TV display to a thousand and more. Everything so dazzling and blinding, covered by glinting stars, Dean thinks his eyes might burn out from looking at the world like this for one more minute, but then realizes the eyes are perfectly used to it -- the eyes that are not entirely his own right now. *Is this the view of the world in Cas's eyes?*

"Cas?" Dean's mouth whispers, tentatively, toward the empty road ahead of him. Cas's body is still slacking on the ground, but this is not what he means.

Inside of him, the stir of another existence emerges. Dean closes his eyes, searching inward.

At the corner of his head, he finds him. Cas looks exactly the same as he remembers him by, the trench coat, the blue tie, the disheveled hair, the bright blue eyes. No rings though, and no wings. Human like. Comfortable and easy to look.

Cas stands there, still and quiet, in the corner of Dean's mind, as if trying to keep his existence as small as possible, like a shy kid hiding himself at the very end of the room at the prom, trying to make himself unnoticeable.

This corner of Dean's mind looks like Bobby's living room back when it's still standing. The place closest to home. And Cas is here.

Dean rushes to him, "There you are."

For all his concerns, Cas looks well. In this current form as he is -- whatever that form is called when he is just a cloud of light inside his mind. He looks a little tired, and a little -- a lot -- worried, with the tight burrow between his eyebrows. But all things considered, he looks fine. No wounds, no scar, no cuttings, and no twisting and distortion. Not like any of the dreams and nightmares Dean has been having. He looks okay, and normal. And utterly human.

Dean spreads his arms and pulls Cas into a hug. His brain produces the sensation of warmth and solidness of a body for him, even if he knows nothing is physical now.

Cas reluctantly raises his arms and wraps them around Dean. Then he doesn't let go. Nor does Dean.

"Hello, Dean." He says, in his gravel voice.

Dean exhales a happy huff, realizes he can't even begin to tell him how much he misses this voice, among everything else.

"Hey, Cas." He says, over his shoulder.

They separate, after long, long time, each taking half a step back, still standing too close, eyes still holding. In this corner of the mind, in this memory or imagination, sunshine cast through the window, leaving long lazy shadow on the soft fuzzy carpet on the living room floor. Dean can almost pretend it's just a comfortable afternoon in a lazy normal day. Everything warm and hazy. They can curl on the sofa and watch TV for hours, take a small nap if they doze off. And Bobby or Sam would call them for dinner.

Dean smiles.

But Cas's frown does not unwind.

"You shouldn't do this." Cas says, his eyes close to reproachful, but it really just is all condensed concerns. And Dean knows.

"Yeah, heard it before, kinda have a name for terrible at doing what I should do by now, ain't I?" Dean grins. The kind of grin that creates a shallow dimple on his cheek.

Cas sighs, and says, quietly, whole-heartedly. "Thank you."

Dean answers with a nod and a smile, "Don't mention it."

He pats Cas on the shoulder. The touch is still warm and solid. Real.

<br>

#### Act 3

Dean opens his eyes again. He is still alone on the cold roadside of Alaska, at the World's End, with no more road to go and a large clump of lifeless figure collapsed in front of him on the ground. But for once, he feels good. For once, he is not really alone -- maybe he never is.

The sensation of Cas's existence tugs slightly in his mind. Dean tucks him in, feeling oddly like hens tucking chickens under their wings. All the while the angel's body is still an enormous hill in front of him. Dean laughs at the humor of the scene. He hears Cas mumbles a small unhappiness at the back of his head.

And Dean has to restrains his smile a little. "Sorry buddy, no, not laughing at the body, I swear." He comforts the angel. "Just thinking how extremely like a black satire movie this is. Would make a master piece as art, instead of, you know, as life."

Cas chuckles softly.

Dean gets better used to the too brightened view now. He widens his eyes in curiosity. The view of the world is so abundant with lights and colors, casting clarity that he has never known. And he realizes the glinting stars constantly shining in his view aren't really stars, that's air, for what air really is. The air is not transparent empty, instead, tiniest particles charged with electricity shooting around, bumping into each other, transferring the power and energy. That must be where all the low buzzing and humming noises come from, and the small prickling electrical feeling on the skin as if touching the low charged power line.

"The whole Earth's electric and magnetic field is being affected by the tear this time." Cas explains in the backseat of his head, deeply worried. "Because of the infinite plasma. The aurora borealis is just the first phenomenon. Soon, the Earth will draw the Moon and itself off the orbit, then affect solar activity so much that the whole solar system will collapse off balance, we don't have long."

Dean looks up at the sky. It looks nothing like what his human eyes witnessed before. Well, in a way, it might still be the same scenery, the mixed dazzling colors, the shapes that are like flowing curtains and snakes and flames sweeping across the sky. Except, there are so much more details fitting in the blanks.

Now he can see more than light, more than color, more than sky. He sees the world as it is, he sees plasmas punching into the ionosphere, he sees electrons jumping in and out of the excited atoms, he sees oxygens glaring red and nitrogen beaming green, there is even infrared and ultraviolet that he's sure beyond human eye perception. The particles dance in the sky, drawing fascinating colors like tails of dragon, wings of phoenix, eyes of thunderbird. The palette of the universe, so big and so small at the same time. A world that no human eyes witness, and now he is showered with its beauty and magnificence. Because he has an angel inside him. He is not watching with eyes only.

He doesn't realize tears are streaming down his face until he hears Cas's low soothing sound: "I'm sorry, Dean. Is it too much? I can restrain the eyesight, and other sensations..."

There is also sound and scent and touch. He doesn't even have enough attention or time for those yet. All the new sensations for the world. It's almost like reborn.

"No, no." Dean mutters, out of breath, wiping away his tears in a hurry. Tears that are not coming from sorrow, or grieve, or worry, or joy, or any emotion really. It's the body reacting to the view, being taken by the grandiosity, overwhelmed by the shared sensation with an angel.

The magic moment is broken by the move. He forces himself to tear the eyes away from the sky, having the sunk feeling knowing that he may not see anything like this again in his life, not after Cas leaves him. He wants to remember this, but he has work to do. Is this what Cas means when he said he can only taste molecules when he tries food? Because to angel's eyes and senses, the whole world is too generously and selfishly only showing its fundamentals all the time, as particles? The view, the sound, the taste, the scent, the touch. Everything as they fundamentally are, as their smallest components. The smallest, and sometimes the biggest. Knowing too much, and sometimes feeling too little.

And he hears Cas answering, quietly, a little sad. "Yes. Sometimes."

Though Dean didn't really ask the question. He doesn't have to.

<br>

He sees the world as it is.

Then he sees Cas as he is.

And he sees himself as he is.

Dean's eyes land on Cas's body next. The giant body dressed with skyscraper-sized trench coat and clothes that is most human yet furthest from human. The body looks slimmer without the wings, but it's still a mountainous presence.

*The vessel is made of atoms and electrons in the material plane.* Dean remembers Cas's words again, the theoretics that Cas tried to explain to him but he had to cut him off because he couldn't understand. And this time, now, he doesn't just understand it, he sees it now.

The hand of the vessel limps alongside the body, lying loosely on the middle of the road, fingers curved, as tall as houses. Dean walks to them. It takes a few minutes.

Everything is in so much details. Every grain on the skin, every line in the palm, every hair and scar, dips and crinkles. He sees the hand, then he sees flesh and blood and bone underneath the skin, at last he sees the atoms and molecules that form every cell, vibrating and humming with energy as all particles do.

Dean presses his own palm on the edge of this giant palm of Cas's body, it feels like touching a wall of flesh, bizarre and unsettling. But they touch. And he finds them the same. The same particles that form everything in this universe, in all the bodies, in Dean's body and Cas's vessel, in flesh and blood, in planets and dust. Things that are as old as stars, and as young as a newborn baby. In the material plane, they are the same. But Castiel is not.

Cas is not physical, not really. Cas does not come from this dimension, but he chooses here, he comes here. He resides in a body, and he walks the Earth. And now, he is inside Dean. He drops the grand form, and he curls up the whole multidimensional wavelength in that small corner of Dean's brain. And he doesn't complain about claustrophobia. He stands there, and he says, "Dean." As if all that he wants to say can be condensed into one word. As if this place, of all, it's the only place he'd rather be.

For the first time, Dean thinks, maybe this is for the first time, he finally starts to have a glimpse of understanding what it means to be an angel. A real angel in all their forms, from their views. Not just the vessel, not just a thread of light, not just a part of a whole. Not just, a fragment of trench coat, a thread of tie fabric, a flying feather, a floating eye, or a silvery slice of the ring -- the pieces he saw in the dimension in between, the pieces giving him nightmares nights after nights. Oddly, Dean finds himself feeling a tiny little bit of appreciation for what that dimension shows him. As many nightmares as it gives him, he finally gets to understand, Cas is magnificent and giant and beautiful, beyond his imagination. For the first time, for real.

Dean clenches his fingers, putting his weight on the hands, holding himself there. At that minute, he wants nothing more than to really hold that hand, hold Cas. So he turns back to inside his head.

Cas meets him in the mental manifestation of Bobby's place. Sunshine that seeps through the window doesn't shift, time doesn't move here. Still the nice lazy afternoon. The bright sunlight shines half of Cas's figure, dying his black hair golden brown.

And Dean reaches for his hands, squeezing, looking him in the eyes. Those big blue, ocean-deep, glacier-old, universe-witnessing, dimension-traveling eyes. And Dean whispers, "God, you really are an Angel."

It has been almost five years since Cas charged into the barn and declared "I'm an Angel of the Lord".

Dean stutters, thinking back all that he saw, not just tonight, not just the past months after Purgatory. "Everything... is, is beautiful, and awesome, and... Jesus, I hope I know more words."

Cas smiles at him, gentle and small smile. He nods slightly. His eyes shining.

He understands.

Dean swallows hard, "Never, ever, say you don't deserve."

And that smile drops.

<br>

#### Act 4

Along with it, the sunshine loses its color and warmth.

"Dean," Cas lowers his eyes. "I really don't --"

Dean shushes him with a finger on his lips. "You can argue all you want later, Cas, but we'll patch you up first, alright? Before anything else, let's fix your body first."

"But that wouldn't be necessary if I need to go back to the dimension in between again." Cas points out.

"*Need to?* You don't freaking *need to* go back that horrible place, Cas!" Dean snaps. "You can just stay here!"

"But that's my responsibility!" Cas snaps too.

"And my responsibility is to keep you alive!" Dean raises his voice.

"And mine is not?" Cas raises his.

They stare at each other, nose to nose, inches away, falling into sudden silence.

For both of them, one of their hands is clenched into fist in exhaustion, the other... Dean realizes in sudden fascination that he's still holding Cas's hand. And Cas seems to realize at the same moment. He makes a small attempt to pull the hand back, but Dean doesn't let him. So Cas gives up trying.

Dean has the vague gut feeling as if the moment he lets the hand slip, Cas will be gone again. Just like the millions of times of the memory replay and nightmare haunting, the moment the palms slip and the weight lightens, Castiel would disappear. It happened in Purgatory, and it feel like it had happened and would happen for so many more times. Dean just can't take more.

His voice hoarse. Cas decidedly keeps his eyes on their hands now, not meeting his eyes.

Dean asks him, gentle, this time, "I only ask this one thing, then, just this one time. But I want you absolutely honest with me, alright, Cas? If you say no, then I'll stop arguing."

He pauses there for a moment, and Cas nods. His eyes drop even lower than where they focused on to. As if the bottom of the sea suddenly sinks, even lower than Mariana Trench, and the color of all the oceans deepens so many degrees that it shows in Castiel's eyes.

And Dean asks him: "Do you *want* to come back? To Earth?" He hesitates for a second, then adds, quieter. "To me?"

*If we can forget what we need to do, forget everything the world and fate and destiny asks, if we can just live for our own and forget about all the consequences, if I choose to stay, will you choose to stay too? Will you come back, to the place I am?*

Dean breathes shallowly. He almost forgets to breathe. He doesn't know whether he should keep his eyes on Cas's lowered eyes where he can only see the flickering eyelashes, or on his fingers. He squeezes the fingers slightly. *Please, be honest. Please, come to me.*

And Cas looks up. He says, agonizingly, "Yes. More than anything. But --"

Dean is already saying, "It's settled, then. Let's patch you up." With a sudden blossomed smile. He breathes smoothly now.

Cas squeezes his fingers back.

<br>

Dean lays his hands -- the real hand in the real world now -- on the edge of Cas's giant vessel's hand. Palm to palm, in the best sense he can manage.

"Okay, Cas, you're up, do you magic." Dean says cheerfully to the air, aiming at the back corner of the mind.

Cas sits down on Bobby's sofa in his mind. "I know you'd hate losing control." He says, "You can be the driver. I'll be the fuel."

Dean blinks. "Didn't know it's even possible,"

"Imagine you're an angel," says Cas, *imagine you're me*, "the grace is all at your disposal." *All of me is at your disposal.*

Dean swears he hears the double take of the words Cas just said. *Guess now that we're sharing the brain room, there is nowhere to hide the true thoughts then.* Dean amuses.

Which just gets confirmed by Cas's quiet thought: *Yes*.

They don't even need to talk anymore. Just the thoughts. Almost like... two-way prayer, minus the praying part. Something like a real soul phone this time.

Dean tries to imagine how it's like to really *be* an angel, as giant and bright as he can imagine, channeling the grace to his hand. It isn't easy in the first try, the mortal feeling is still too strong, the feet are too stuck to the ground he can't fly. Then, the lighter feeling comes in. He remembers the flying particles in the air and the shifting plasma that creates the colors and lights on the aurora, the color and the lights in the vision. He imagines being an angel -- being Cas -- walking the Earth, seeing the biggest and smallest things, witnessing the universe from its birth to its doom.

He imagines three pairs of wings spread out on his back from the shoulder blades, he imagines looking down at the earth as if he's flying, or his eyes are a thousand feet high, and that he has thousands of eyes. He imagines white blue lights flowing from his eyes. For a moment, Dean feels so disoriented at the imagination that he wonders if it's still his own mind imagining, or it's Cas's memory seeping in.

Golden lights flow out of Dean's palms, sinking into the giant body. The center of his palm is warm. The air around the glowing light seems to be boiling, like the air above burning hot asphalt roads in a hot summer day, melting and steaming, making the distant views distorted. Or the air above a burning pyre.

The heated air around the body changes the form and shape of the flesh, just like the vision of stretches of the road shift through the heated air. Shortly, Dean finds it difficult to tell if it's because the air deceives the vision, or the actual physical shape of Cas's body is being transformed. Some distant part of his body seems to be sizing down, but Dean can't really tell for sure. There are more lights gathering.

He continues to try anyway, focusing on the thought that he's fixing Cas's body up, using the grace that is inside him, almost like part of him now. Dean still finds the idea too unearthly, he would rather it like fixing Impala's engine, one that he can open the hood, disconnect and reconnect the pipes, and find the broken parts, then he can use wrenches and screwdrivers to fix it. It's easy.

He is good at fixing things, he has always been. And the process of seeing something recovered from broken, it calms him. *He's not the one breaking things, he's the one that fixes them.* Dean thinks. He just wishes he's as good in fixing everything else too, more than impala.

His memory wanders back to the time when he has to watch Sam hurt bad from the hallucination of Lucifer, then Cas hurt as bad after taking over the craziness. Though Dean never really know what has happened in their heads back then. Something thousands of times worse than what he could see, he can only presume.

The view is even more wobbly now, the air is filled with more sparkling lights of small flying particles, brighter than what he just started grow used to. The vision is like the plain human view with a layer of celestial special effect on top, then another brighter layer, covering the reality. He can barely see the giant body in front of him clearly now. He finds his own attention slipping away.

Dean blinks. The view changes completely.

<br>

### Chap. 6 Inside My Mind (Ritual+reunion)

> **Outline:** Dean actually start rituals: angel exorcism to banish (S04E10/16 Alastair's expel spell; separate true form with vessel), immediately summon him back (S06E21 angel summoning spell; avoid true form going into heaven), use holy fire to bound (avoid leaving); let Cas possess him as vessel temporarily, use his own power fix his vessel's size, jump back into his body.
>
> Dean insists trying, ritual works, Cas shares Dean's body but both awake, Cas use mojo to fix vessel (Dean witnesses, amazed, "so this is how it's like, internally" "that sounds so wrong but whatever") and ready to go back into it (Cas all the time quiet), Dean mentally apologize and tell him his true form is awesome before Cas goes back (talk in Dean's brain, both normal: "You really think that?" "Yeah, I do"). Cas leaves Dean's body, own body remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, problem solved, "Welcome back."
>
> use half Dean's soul+half Cas's grace to fix the tear, so Dean won't die & Cas's won't be gone/fall (or sacrifice a Meg? or use love to solve it?)
>
> *"Death is an infinite vessel, so is love."*

#### Act 1 (Cas memory)

A sudden chilly air blows to his body, Dean shivers in the drop of temperature. It is different from the icy wind in Alaska though, more like... Dean glances around on instinct, and finds an open window with thin flying curtain. He looks around, bewildered. The view seems somewhat familiar, but he can't quite place it immediately.

The wall is white, so is the single small bed in the center of the room, with protection bars on four sides. It's an infirmary bed. He's in a hospital, of some sort.

Dean looks down at himself, and he freezes. He's in hospital clothing, soft white shirt and pants. The same hospital dressing he sees Cas wore near the end of last year on Earth, and the whole time when he was in the Purgatory. Dean has to put the trench coat over him to cover the sick feeling at the sight and reminder of the meaning of that hospital dressing, but he sees it all the time anyway. His right wrist has a blue paper loop.

"Cas?" Dean frowns hard at his hand in his view -- the hand that is undoubtedly belonged to Cas, whispering. "Is this... your memory?"

Cas's voice passes into his mind slowly, surprised as well, a slight "Oh", then, "I think it might be because of my grace. Some memory is too deeply entangled with the grace, when you channel them, they go past your soul. The process may affect your perceptions, as if seeing through my eyes."

He pauses, hesitating.

*There are some things he doesn't want me to see.* Dean thinks, feeling the edge of some emotion start crawling up.

"No, Dean, not hiding from you, not lying," Cas's voice is already answering to his realization before the name of these emotions can settle in, before Dean can really take a grasp of them. "I will not do that again. But these memories, they might be uncomfortable to watch. I just don't want you harmed."

"You lived through those, didn't you?" Dean says, not waiting for an answer. "Surely it can't hurt me like the past has hurt you. The least I can do is to learn how bad it is."

Cas falls silent for a moment, then says very quietly. "Dean, some of them are really bad."

And Dean answers him, "Close your eyes then, if you don't want to relive them. Hold my hand if you want." They're not really face to face in the mental living room any more, so really, that's just a metaphorical speaking. But Cas gets it. He doesn't argue. As if he sits back to Bobby's sofa with a still slightly tensed back.

The view of the hospital tunes in and out, as if looking through a bad telescope, with the focus lens being screwed constantly. Dean squints at the view, feeling a headache growing at the back of the skull just by looking at it.

He murmurs, "That's how you saw things during those times, Cas? And I was blaming you for being... you know, nuts?"

*That's the better days.* Cas answers through thought.

"God, I'm sorry." A sigh slips out of Dean, "What's a bad day like?"

Cas stays quiet, but as if an answer, the view shifts again. The hospital dissolves into a library, a beautiful, ancient library that Dean has only seen in the most fancy movie scenes. The arched ceilings are so tall that as if they are the sky, the corridors are long and wide, and there are countless bookshelves with beautiful delicately carved markings and decorations soaring toward the ceiling like the tall pillars of ancient cathedrals from Roman era. And then there are so many books, books that Dean imagines should all have been kept neatly on the shelves, indexed and illustrated, carefully sorted and placed. Except, they are not.

The library is a post-tornado mess. The remnant of the beauty and grand of the place remains, but the books are so scattered that Dean doesn't know if there is a place he can step on without accidentally treading on the scattered pages. The pages are torn and mixed, the beautifully carved glistening covers lay around everywhere on the ground. The shelves are disoriented as well, only those on his close vicinity standing in roughly parallel, further down the corridor, many of them are pushed down to the floor, the remaining standing ones are crossed left and right, as if someone has been working on fixing them, but only managed to straighten the very few at the beginning of the wreck, there are still so much more to go. The whole place is more like a rumpled sea of random pages than a library, piling on the ground, some flying in the air. The shelves empty.

But when Dean looks closely, he notices the shelves are not all empty. The ones closest to him, the few that are straightened and put back to place, some books have been reassembled and placed back on to the racks. The covers and pages are still visibly torn out, but they remain stand on the edge of each rack. *Survivors of the tornado? Maybe?* Dean thinks, finding it a comfort to see there are remaining books on the shelves, that the place is not completely ruined.

"What's this place?" Dean asks. Cas doesn't answer.

Instead, Dean finds his body kneel down to the floor, reaching for a page -- not *his* body, Dean mentally corrects himself, it's Cas's memory, it's Cas's body for the moment. His fingers touch a page closest to him, and his eyes start reading it. There is an illustration of a cat on the page, a lazy tabby lying on the page, holding its tongue out, long and pink, staring at him. The text below reads "*Sharp spines or papillae can be found in a cat's tongue, there are five types of papillae...*" along with some other notes and facts about cats.

His finger turns the page over. On the back side, there is a different section about some other knowledge of cats, and it starts talking about "*Felines, especially domestic cats, are well known for having penile spines, which is needed to stimulate the female cat into ovulation...*"

He hears a low sigh in his throat, fingers touching the word "female cat" and his voice saying "*I know for a fact the females were not consulted about that.*" The vision shifts between the library and hospital briefly as the voice comes through, like the owner of the voice is talking to someone in the different place. The view from the hospital is more like a translucent ripple overlay, but Dean catches a glimpse of himself and Sam standing, face worried and annoyed.

The view focuses back to the library. His body stands up, and puts the page inside one of the books on the shelf to the right of him. The cover says "*Anatomy of the Cat*", and it's about half the thickness as the book is supposed to be, according to the spine width, all the pages loosen. And with a glance, Dean realizes all the other books on the shelves are all in a similar condition -- worn, torn, pages loosen, but Cas is putting them back in.

Cas walks back to the pile of the books that is mountain high, and reaches down to pick another page. This one has some monkeys dancing around a bonfire, as if singing and talking, as if highly intelligent, just like... oh, not monkeys, that's the primal human beings. Dean glances at the note, which says something about Neanderthals and their poetries and rituals. Dean finds his head dizzy again. Cas, in this memory, in his body, just straightens up from the floor, walks over to the shelves, and puts the page into a different book on a different shelf, that says "*Human Evolution*". And he goes back to pick the next page.

The realization weighs on his chest so heavy that Dean fears his ribs might get crushed the next minute. He wants to raise his hand to catch his own chest, but the body feels fine, the breathing is normal. The body is still following and replaying the movement from the memory, like a pre-configured robot.

The random comments here and there. The pieces of knowledge and the glints of attention. "*Did you know that a cat's penis is sharply barbed along its shaft?*" "*I was backing the Neanderthals because their poetry was... just amazing. It's in perfect tune with the spheres. You guys ate the apple, invented pants.*" The Cas in the hospital, smiling at him, holding a finger saying "Pull it", and start talking about cats and dogs and monkeys and bees...

Dean stares at the pages and books and shelves again, feeling his eyes would sting if he has control over the body.

The pieces.

That's all the pieces of Cas's mind.

Broken.

Torn apart.

Like tornado sweeping through the library, all the knowledge are still here, but so scattered, so broken, that he had to put them back, piece by piece, page by page, reading each one of them, putting them back in order, then look at the next. Each piece can be from a far too different topic, a different book, a different area of the brain. He takes the page, walks to the correct shelf, puts them in between the book cover, then walks back, and does the same again for the next piece.

"*It took everything to get me here.*" Cas had already told him, back then, in the hospital, hadn't he? But Dean didn't listen, he just, couldn't understand. Dean winces, wondering what he was distracted by at that time, that he could let that statement slip through without really asking "*What happened*". Then he remembers, he was angry, back then, so angry that all he can think of is snapping at Cas, telling him "button up his coat and help them take down the Leviathans", because he was thinking, that was all his fault. All the while Cas is in here, inside his own head, going round and round, piecing himself together, piece by piece.

"I'm sorry." says Cas.

His voice startles Dean.

"What?"

He means, *Why are you apologizing? I should be the one. I should have known things are difficult, so difficult. You're already doing your best, you're always doing your best. Whatever the result, you tried, you tried so damn hard. I should have known. I should have at least asked...*

And Cas says again, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry I destroyed everything. I'm sorry I was afraid I would destroy everything again. I'm sorry about all the mess and..."

"Cas," Dean stops him, he can barely find his own voice. "I'm sorry, too. And I forgive you, Cas. I forgave you long time ago."

But Cas is still saying, "I'm sorry..." As if his mind is back on that old self, looped like a cassette tape, playing the only message it can maintain the focus on. His body picks another page, and another. He reads them, and puts them into the right places. His thought passes through the head, *I'm sorry I was broken. I'm sorry I'm broken again. I need to piece myself together, I need to put myself together because there is something important outside that needs fix, because there is someone important outside that is waiting for me, because we also have too many important things to fix...*

"Hey, hey, Cas, Cas." Dean nudges him mentally, thinking to take control back, focusing back onto the view of Bobby's living room, the sunshine on the carpet through the window.

And he is steered back into that warm bright sunshine and lazy afternoon that they never had. Cas slumps in the corner of the sofa where the sunshine can't reach, curling small, arms tight around knees, as if trying to hold himself together the best he can. As if he really is still broken. His eyes unfocused, his lips murmur over and over again, "I'm sorry."

Dean puts a hand on his shoulder. Cas is startled. The loop is broken. His lips are still trembling, but no sound comes out. His eyes fragile.

Dean lowers himself in front of the sofa, edging to his side, wrapping the arm around him in a gesture to pull the angel toward him. His eyes level with Cas's.

"Listen to me," he starts, then pauses, his mind wandering back to Cas's library. The grand, beautiful hall, the ancient shelves, the countless books. All the knowledge and memory he had, all the millions of years he lived through. What would it look like when Cas is not broken? When everything is ancient and elegant? Must be breath-taking. Must be as spectacular and beautiful as everything that Cas is. Dean tells him, firmly, "You're forgiven, Cas." And, "You're not broken. Even if you are, I can help fix, I'm good at it. Don't worry. We'll figure it out."

Cas's ocean-blue eyes focuses on Dean's. The look of broken and pieces is still lingering in that deep blue ocean water, like shattered glasses floating on the wave. But he nods, small.

There is still so much glistening in those eyes, so much pain and guilt and regret and apology floating in there like a dark fog ghosting on the sea. But he tries to straighten up slightly on the sofa, all the while keeping the gaze on Dean, and he says, after a while, quietly, "Thank you."

He leans into the arms wrapped around him, returning the hold.

Dean grips him tight, hands caressing his backs gently in a soothing move. Like those huge wings once did.

<br>

#### Act 2

So Dean continues.

In the outside world, more lights and grace flow through his palms, layering onto the giant vessel, coating the body like a blanket made of light. The body becomes visibly smaller now, from the shape of a huge mountain and height of a skyscraper, to the size of a hill and possibly height of the highest cathedral and library in the world. But the lights fill in the gaps, as if it's not shrinking, just dissolving into a different form.

There probably shouldn't have been that much lights. Dean thinks, eyes following the wave of lights, wondering how the physics of the grace works, and decides, if that triggers another physics lecture with all the terminologies from Cas, he'll have to skip the class.

But really, the grace is pouring out from him and into Cas's body, not just channeling from the center of the palm, it expands to his whole hand, then whole arm, then, without needing to look down on himself, Dean knows his whole body is lightened up by the grace, and the light of the grace is continuing flowing out non-stoppingly.

Should he start worrying? Dean feels a pull of panic start accumulating at the bottom of his gut again. Will it eventually drain Cas's grace? But really, is all the light coming from Cas's grace? The brightness and the way they flow around, swirling and thickening, it almost looks like the lights are regenerating, multiplying, growing on themselves like nuclear reaction.

Now that he thinks about it, that theory seems increasingly plausible. "Cas, am I going to explode into light or something?" Dean hushes.

"I don't think so," Cas answers, but the voice doesn't sound convincing. "I hope not."

That is when a great surge of grace dash out of Dean right near his heart, brushing hard on some core essence of his internal. The warmth from the grace skyrockets to a near burning sensation. Dean let out an uncontrollable yell that is bouldering pain. Though not exactly unpleasant, more surprised. *The Hell is that? Feel like my soul just get touched or something.*

*Yes. Sorry.* Cas's thought comes through as soon as Dean's own thought forms. *I'm afraid it might indeed be a chain reaction, somehow your soul is outputting energy along with my grace. I'm so sorry, I didn't know it's possible, I would never harm you...*

*I know, Cas. How do we stop a nuclear explosion?*

*I don't know.* Cas is deeply worried, making a mental move as if he's about to leave Dean's body.

*Hell no, you don't jump the car when it's racing out of control.* Dean keeps his hold on Cas steady, mentally and physically. *You buckle up for hell of a roller coaster trip, you hear me? We sail through the storm, together.* Dean huffs, pressing his hands on the body harder. By the ways the light and power and electricity pouring out, he knows as a fact, whatever is coming, he would need a steady hold to not fall. Especially when there is someone else on the passenger seat.

<br>

The view ripples and shakes so violently that Dean loses sense of the reality seconds later. The movies and images in front of his eyes shift so extremely rapidly like a tape player uncontrollably rewind and replay at random places.

He sees grey sky and ominous shades of trees swaying, monsters eying covetously. Dean sees his own back, from Cas's view, holding the bone blade, slashing the attacking leviathans and all other monsters. Cas dodges and ducks and strikes back too, for the ones that jump him, but all the while, Dean notices, his own figure is always, always remain in the view. Every time he's slightly overwhelmed, Cas comes to his side.

He thinks back to his own experience, and the view shifts along with his train of thought. He's killing the monsters, fierce and ruthless. He glares at the ones that are coming to him, and he watches out for the ones coming to Cas. He glances at Cas's hand that usually would hold an angel blade but empty this time, he itches to hand him his blade. Instead, he throws himself in front of Cas, blocking the hideous looks those surrounding leviathans shoot at him. He kills them before they can reach within an arm's distance to Cas.

*Oh.* Dean hears Cas's quiet voice murmur at the view from the back of the head, knowing he's watching the same scene replayed from the different angle for the first time.

*Yeah, fun time.* Dean shoots him a thought. *Nice teamwork.*

*It is truly great teamwork.* Cas agrees.

Then the swirly blue-white portal comes into the sight. At first glimpse Dean isn't sure whose memory it is, then he knows it's Cas's, because the steps become more unstable and shaky than he remembers for himself. The portal gets closer by each step, Cas's steps are slower and more sluggish by each step, but it's not from exhaustion. His own voice sounds up from the memory, yelling over the monsters' growling and wind: "Come on, Cas, come on!" He sees his own eyes glancing back, checking on Cas, worried but hopeful, at least the way out is right in front of them now. Then there is Cas's thought replaying from the memory, *I should be left behind. I don't deserve to be saved.*

Dean blurts out at that, "You sound just like me when we first met, you remember that?"

Surprised, Cas stutters. He makes a sound that is like nothing other than swallowing. Then, slowly, "Yes, I remember. And I can finally understand now."

"And you remember what you said to me back then?"

"Yes."

"Tell me."

"I told you, back then, good things do happen. You deserve to be saved."

Dean really wants to hold the stare with Cas's eyes at this moment, but he thinks Cas gets the idea. "You mean that, and you believe that?"

"Of course, Dean. For you, always." Cas answers earnestly.

"Then remember, same for you. Alright?" Dean tells him firmly.

*Even if my mistakes are way worse and more beings are devastated?* Cas doesn't put it into words but Dean receives the thought anyway.

The view now is composed of flashes of bloody scenes on Earth and even more horrifying scenes of dead angels butchered on the ground of Heaven. Burned out wings from dead angels stain the meadow for miles, there must be hundreds if not thousands of angels there. Cas stands in the center of the site, looking down on them, announcing his coronation and verdict as the new God.

Cas makes a terrified, sick sound at the view as if he's about to throw up.

Dean remembers the basement that night, the look on Cas's face, the despise in his eyes when he said they are all but ants to him. He was about to kneel down before him, his heart thumped in so much agony he couldn't breathe. Dean wasn't resentful, no, he was mourning the Cas that was his friend was gone, and this being with the same face was not Cas anymore, because he has said so already, "the Castiel you know is gone." Then he remembers the blood dripping down Cas's mouth, leviathans twisting his face. The floating, bloody trench coat in the water.

The view shifts to that lakeside, and the only thing in sight, is that damp trench coat, washed up and down by the water.

Everything is so hard to see, to think, even harder to say it. But he has to tell Cas this. "Yes, even with that. Hell, who says yours is worse anyway. I jump started Apocalypse, that doesn't stop you from saving me, so yeah, no, wouldn't stop me whatsoever."

*Even if I betrayed you and hurt Sam?* This thought comes through extremely hard, as if it is literally cutting Cas open and tearing him apart again just by thinking it, blood would drip at the edge of the thought. But it is also so obvious he never really stops thinking it, never stops beating himself up for it.

Dean stumbles on that, but swallows and steadies himself. "Just, just don't do that again."

*I'm sorry.*

"I know. Cas. I know." Dean takes a long, shagged breath. "I forgave you."

The flashing images from the memory slow down in the view, the broken pieces, the dazzling light, the confusing scenes of the dimension in between, the long and ugly past, the hell, the purgatory. Some are Cas's, others are Dean's, many times, they find the pieces mixed together. One by one, they pick them up, sort them out, as if cleaning the floor where all the glassware and chinaware have been shattered, and they are working together to put them back, glue them together. The edges are sharp, the broken pieces are tiny, but they work together. One by one, piece by piece, just like Cas puts the torn book pages in his memory library back onto the shelves, just like Dean's djinn dream of the dimension in between and they put the pieces of cloth fabric and feather together to make a Picasso-style form turn to a Leonardo da Vinci art.

"There, you're the new Mona Lisa now. Fresh and new." After the last piece of aching memory piece flashed by and settled down, the view shifts back to the comfortable corner in Dean's head, back to Bobby's house. Dean pats fondly on Cas's shoulder, half-joking. *You're more beautiful than Mona Lisa.* His thought amends uncontrollably.

Cas tilts his head to him, a small grin. "You know I can hear that too."

Dean flushes slightly. "Can't blame a man thinking the truth."

His arms are still wrapped around Cas, the posture unchanged since all the roller coaster twists and turns started. And now, finally, it feels like they land somewhere.

Cas uncurls his body, turning slightly on the sofa, facing Dean. His eyes locked on Dean's, unblinking, watery.

Dean finds his own eyes attracted like magnetic. He can see himself from Cas's eyes. The intensity makes his head dizzy, the whole surrounding disappears. He drowns in the blue, thinking, *Nothing in the world is more perfect.*

And an echoing thought returns, *Yes, there is. You.*

Dean blinks, eyes widened slightly, face flushed hotter.

Cas's eyes sweeps down, over his cheek, land on his lips, then moves back to his eyes.

Dean catches every movement of his eyes, swallows, then leans in carefully.

Cas pulls him in, closing the remaining distance between their lips.

Dean closes his eyes, indulging himself in the feeling. His heart warm and swelling.

Cas is not the only one getting pieced together here.

<br>

#### Act 3

"Thank you for saving me." Cas says, once they finally pull apart.

"Any time." Dean grins, "You can thank me when we get you back into your body. Then we can do this properly."

They almost forget they're still only half-way done.

And the world is probably still on the edge of ending.

"We settled all the pieces?" Dean checks on Cas, "Everything inside and outside, angel and human? Fixed everything?"

Cas nods. "I think so."

There is still a small sound deep down somewhere humming something depressing, if they have to guess, the shitty things never really go away for good, especially when the things they really want to get rid of is just a thought that takes root. They can't even really tell whose it is, maybe both. Dean knows well enough, and can sense it like a stubborn dark shade in the corner of the whole palette of the thoughts. But at least that hasn't formed into a full sentence of thought yet, so Dean considers it acceptable for now. Cas agrees quietly.

They shift the attention back to the outside. Reality sinks back in.

Dean checks on Cas's body immediately. The lights and flowing grace have been more dazzling than ever. The whole ground where the giant body once occupied is like a field made of light and energy. In the center of all the light, Dean is kneeling besides Cas's body, hands held together. The body -- Cas's body, made of flesh and blood like any human -- is returned to the normal human size now.

The buzzing sound of the charged air is louder than ever, the electricity in the air makes all hairs stand. Any friction feels like able to trigger a spark. Dean spares split of a second glancing at the tear in the space and the crazily darting aurora lights in the sky. The Earth feels like on the edge of overcharging and about to explode and burn like the Sun at any minute. Dean returns the attention back to Cas, hoping they still have at least a minute or two.

Dean separates their hands, lights stop pouring out from him, the ones already out there still surround the body. He regards the face of the body, the closed eyes, the crumpled coat. The body looks just like an empty shell, a doll, there is no expression on that face, no similarity to a life. Nothing like a man sleeping, more like a house with no one inside. He shifts uneasily.

"Want to try the first ride now?" Dean asks, trying to hide the nervousness.

*Honestly, not really. I'm spoiled in here.* Cas stretches mentally, his grace already start unfurling as he sends the last thought.

"I know, buddy. That's on me." Dean can't help chuckling, the worry dies down slightly.

He squeezed Cas's hand in the mental image one last time, and reluctantly lets his hand slip. Cas puts his palms on Dean's cheek, touching one last time, then stands up from the sofa. Then his human form turns into three spinning rings with three pairs of wings, covered by bright silvery blue lights. Dean watches the light fly up, out of his mind's eyes.

The warm sensation of Cas's grace dancing around his soul lingers just one moment longer, then Cas flies out. Dean watches the light flowing out of his mouth, moving into the vessel's, already missing the company inside the head. That corner of the brain where Cas occupied, the side of the sofa where the sunshine doesn't reach, that spot feels too empty now.

Dean pushes down the bubbling sense of emptiness, forcing the attention onto the body, onto Cas.

The new swarm of light has all flowed inside the body, Dean assumes that means Cas with all his existence has moved into the new home now. He reaches back for Cas's hand, waiting for a twitch in the fingers or a blink of eyes, anything.

Dean holds his breath waiting, until his body protests. He resumes the breath, sharp and uneven, Cas's body still doesn't show any sign of life. No chest rising falling, no breath, no heartbeat, no pulse.

*You miss the timing, you're stuck with a corpse.* That was what Meg has warned him.

"No, no, no, Cas! Wake up, buddy." Dean starts panicking, he pats Cas's face, shaking his shoulder. His voice shuddered and broken. "What did I do wrong? Don't do this to me, Cas."

He doesn't hear Cas's answer, only the louder and louder sound of electricity blending together from all directions, like biggest thunders the world has ever seen.

After Cas leaves, the view and all senses return to the human level, dumbed and limited, but he has pretty good guesses of what's happening. The sky is boiling with colors, all the red and purple and green dancing relentlessly, merging and separating, forming shapes beyond imagination. The whole sky looks like it's going to tear open an entrance to the universe and pour everything down through the hole, just to make more space to host more of the colors and lights. The plasmas must be reaching some extreme threshold now. His heart drops to the lowest abyss.

"Can't believe it's still gonna end like this." Dean murmurs bitterly, letting go of Cas's hand, fumbling on the ground for the demon blade he dropped earlier, turning to face the tear of the space.

*Right when he thought he could have what he wanted for once, everything is gonna go to wreck again. Classic.* Dean almost laughs, at his own naiveness that things will just be fine, at the joke the world and fate throws on him.

"Here goes nothing." Dean grits his teeth, aiming the tip of the blade at his heart, closing his eyes. "*Death is an infinite vessel.*"

His hands start adding force onto the hold of the blade, but the expected piercing pain through the chest does not come. Instead, he feels his wrists are gripped tight, and a gravel voice growls, "Dean."

Dean snaps open his eyes. There he is. Cas. Beautiful, glaring, bright, furious. He snatches the blade from Dean's hand, Dean can't find strength to resist. He can only throw the arms around Cas and hold him tight, breathing out shakily. "Thank God, Cas. I thought it didn't work."

"It took longer than I expected to settle everything down in here. But I did not expect to see I'm almost too late *again* the minute I come back." Cas still sounds pissed.

"Oh that," Dean pulls back from the hug, rubbing his nose, looking like a child caught stealing from piggy bank.

"Yes, that! Thought we're over this self-sacrifice-to-save-the-world routine." Cas snaps.

"You have a better idea fixing that? 'Cause I don't really want to condemn the world again." Dean challenges.

"Actually, I do, I just didn't think it's something I could have until very recently."

Dean raises eyebrows waiting for an elaboration.

Cas glances at the lights that are still hanging around on the ground, giant-body shaped, as if the phantom giant still hasn't left, then at the tear, then back to Dean.

"It needs energy to fuel the patch, then needs something infinite to actually close it." Cas starts, Dean nods, half understanding, half encouraging in anticipation.

"Angel grace is a lot of energy as a good starting point," he pauses, and levels Dean a look. "And I supplied it with millions of years of knowledge and memory I had for the last two times. It's not infinite, but with all the things I saw and I knew, all the history of universe from the beginning of the time, all the people I witnessed and memorized, all the emotions I felt. Everything in my brain, it was enough to keep the tears closed for long enough until you're safe. That was my initial plan for this time too."

Dean makes a gesture as if he's going to argue, but Cas presses his hand down, just continues. "But now we have something better, so much better. We have the free energy," he gestures to the residue light on the ground, "the energy converted from the disappearing mass from the shrinking body, the beautiful physics rule of Mass-Energy Conversion. I have to admit even I forgot to take it into account."

"And the infinite thing?"

"You see, Dean. Death is not the only infinite thing, and there is this other thing, so much more abundant and tremendous than the past, so easy to forget the potential -- the future." Cas squeezes Dean's hands, pulling him closer, almost talking directly into his breath. Dean can't tear his eyes away from the Angel. "The future is limitless, countless, endless. With you, between us, now there are infinite possibilities of where the future can go. The *possibilities* of what the whole world can become because of us, that is superfluous even for a different dimension."

"Wow," Dean gasps, truly amused, heartquaken. *That is the hottest thing I've ever heard of. Poetic, too.*

He looks at Cas, almost expecting he picks up his thought already. Then he remembers they are not sharing body anymore. So instead, he sends the message through prayer.

Cas smiles. "Yes, it is indeed very poe..."

Dean doesn't let him finish, he can't wait anymore, already pulling him in to close the very small remaining distance, and presses his lips on the opened ones of Castiel's.

He feels the dry and chapped lips, the warm and soft sensation, Cas's hands in his hair, his in Cas's. The sensations he misses when they were both in his head. Guess brain just can't imagine everything, and this, this is so much better.

And he can't wait to see the infinite possibilities of the future, like Cas says, given that the world doesn't end before that. Dean chances a look at the nasty tear of the dimension, the energy converted from the shrunk body mass is flying toward the gap. The edge of the tear starts patching up from bottom to top, like the times he watched Cas's grace snitching them up on the Rocky Mountain and in the Redwoods.

Cas grunts a groan under his lips, complaining about his distraction. Dean makes a chuckling sound in his throat, putting his full attention back to Cas, ignoring the world now.

Cas's body is warm and solid in his touch, his tongue soft and gentle, his dark hairs intertwined with his fingers, reminding Dean of the time when his fingers were winded up with Cas's astonishingly beautiful starry-black wings and feathers. He tastes the clean earthy taste in Cas's mouth, reminded of the wet fresh air after a hot summer afternoon downpour. He feels the vibration from his heartbeat through the skin, he hears his small moaning sound in the throat. Dean uses all his senses to feel Cas, wondering if he would feel him differently if he could have angelic senses just for a minute for this, if Cas feels him differently.

The world is forgotten at moments like this, all Dean can think of is Cas, and those infinite literally world-saving earth-turning futures ahead of them. And Cas, by the calm happy look on his face, the eyelashes quivering like butterfly's wings, is thinking the same.

The kiss is not broken until way after the world falls silent.

"Listen." Cas manages, after forever. The time must have paused for them, the world must have stopped spinning for them.

Dean pants a little, leaning his forehead on Cas's, tilting his head slightly to do what he asked.

"I don't hear anything." He says. The surrounding is quiet, only the sound of pine leaves shuffling in the light breeze.

"Exactly." Cas smiles.

There is no sound of electricity, no charged air, no prickling feeling on the skin. Just the wind, the leaves, the normal natural sound.

They look up at the sky. The aurora borealis is still displaying on the canopy, but it's returning to what it used to be, what it should be. Quiet colors of red and green taking turns, moving as the blowing wind moves the air. The view is still breath-taking, but no longer earth-shakenly disturbing.

"Think that means the world is not gonna end any time soon?" Dean beams.

Cas nods, happy.

They go back for another peck of kiss, then head toward the impala.

The world moves on, and the infinite future, just start growing from here.

*Death is not the only infinite vessel. So is freedom. So is love.*

#### draft notes

(Cas's memory of edge of purgatory+in between dimension -> move to shift quickly between scenes)

- in between dimension: self-aware the monstrous form, own pieces, upset, worried; see Dean in seance, only an eye, talking
- ~~purgatory memory: watch Dean from back, thinking to leave behind, but doesn't want to harm his feeling, agree to go, but torn apart; the pain and the knowledge that glad to redeem, the regret~~
- know Dean's sacrifice plan, angry, sad
- ~~God!Cas time memory: devastated heaven, vaporized thousands of angels, killed humans, bloodbath; might kill himself (+flashback of Dean's plan, deliberately not mention as one of the "danger" if expelled but not summoned in time) => passing lines, quick~~
- ~~mad!Cas time memory: piecing his own mind together, hospital scene; pieces, again~~
- ~~620 big divorce moment, Dean's heartbroken eyes about his betrayal; 619 witness Dean with Lisa and leave: want Dean happy~~
- show how broken he was, how sorry he was, how deep he believe Dean wouldn't forgive him or want him back again, want to be left behind again, need to fix it too

Cas let Dean use his grace to fix the vessel, all the memories from Cas's POVs, for Dean to help piece him back (this is also the piece back/fix process, though neither knows)

How to fix the tear: mass-energy equivalence, the law of physics solves itself; grace/soul channel together, amplifying/catalyzing the mass-energy conversion, E=mc^2, when the giant body shrinks, the missing matters turn to energy, turn to chain reaction, energies fix the tear

(but the energy isn't infinite, so actually it's power of love)

Cas leaves Dean's body, own body remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, "Welcome back.", then solve the tear problem

*"Death is an infinite vessel, so is love."* (Cas knows, but he doesn't believe it's true so doesn't think it's possible) ~~(hinted requited love both ways but don't need to write it out)~~

~~use half Dean's soul+half Cas's grace to fix the tear, so Dean won't die & Cas's won't be gone/fall (or sacrifice a Meg? or use love to solve it? or Dean actually die once, but Cas resurrect him just quickly enough?) (mass-energy equivalence, the law of physics solves itself? feel fitting) (E=mc^2 + power of soul/grace (a bit soul/grace dance, chain reaction), actually power of love)~~
