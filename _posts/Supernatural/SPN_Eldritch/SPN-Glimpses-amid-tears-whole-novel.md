## Draft

### Art prompt

> Castiel leaves purgatory through the portal with Dean, but since Cas is in a vessel without a soul the human portal has unexpected consequences and Castiel is stuck in a spliced form of his true form and human vessel. Cas is stuck between dimensions and keeps fighting to get back to the same plane as Dean, and the process of reappearing creates omens that Dean can trace to find him when he does briefly appear in his giant form.

### Outline

time: October 2012

Dean comes back from purgatory, witnesses Cas get torn apart the moment he pass through the portal and disappears, doesn't know if Cas is killed in the process, determined to find Cas if he's not (self-comfort: maybe he's just pulled away, like angel-banishing spell). Dean goes to find Sam, Sam is living with Amelia happily, Dean decides not pull him out of apple pie life again, goes to hunt/search on his own, actively looks for monster/Leviathan/angel sign

Dean finds case of yeti in snow mountain (Rocky Mountain, Colorado), rumor says bigfoot trace but not bare foot, dress shoe trace, witness says seeing trench coat fabric but must be hallucination, Dean raises hope, starts searching, finds tear of dimension and bloody coat fabric in it (too big), believes Cas is out there (keep feeling being watched). finds actual Yeti escaped from purgatory, Yeti-Troll fights, Dean gets in between and almost gets killed, saved by angelic light but can't see Cas; the grace light weave into tear, sends monsters back and fix the hole, Cas gets pulled away as it closes [+Cas POV: dark, confused, chaotic, stumble foot print in snow, pulled away before manifest]

Dean follows giant monster witness report, rumor says Archaeopteryx (ancient first bird fossil) in place with huge tall trees (Redwood, California). Dean drives there, gets spooked, feels being watched but no one around, thinks he sees shape of giant Cas's wings in night black but disappear in blink (only get a glimpse), thinks he's going crazy, finds another tear of dimension and bloody feather in it (too big). almost gets killed by Greek creature Harpy (half-human half-bird, eat human, decapitation) and gets saved by Cas, protected by six huge black wings (Cas wants to talk but only in true voice and too loud, breaks glasses, but Dean is sure by now it's Cas), Cas gets pulled away again as the tear closes [+Cas POV: can't talk, can't stay, self-aware weird shape, watch Dean from the other side, see him hurt and fight to force through to save, weakened by each attempt]

Dean goes to Missouri, Pamela's seance had witnessed Cas's true form in multidimension then so can Missouri (use feather/coat fabric as medium), Dean gets info hint that Cas's true form and vessel are spliced and he's stuck, swears to find&help him. [+Cas POV: meet with Missouri in seance/spirit dimension, can talk/see, hesitant to come back because not want to continue tear dimension to endanger reality&Dean]

Dean drives around, keeps getting spooky feeling of continuously being watched, hears local legend of Cthulhu (humanoid, huge, tentacle, hundreds of meters tall) in Alaska, sees weird/astonishing aurora lights on sky, drives there. midnight, empty road, tear opens, sees giant Cas manifest in full size right in front of impala, wings+rings with eyes+trench coat, leviathans also come through the tear. Dean shocked/terrified/in awe then busy fighting, giant Cas kills them (easier than normal size but easily tired). Dean&Cas grab a few moments to talk/sync (the physics theory behind), Cas worries his reaction at first, Dean needs time to adjust, sees him for real now, not react/communicate well. Cas sensitive, feel rejected/upset, afraid Dean disgust/fear his true form now, self-aware being monster. Cas gets weaker quickly for staying in this dimension talking for long, fighting against natural order, and with the tear more leviathans coming through. For Dean's safety and Cas's own exhaustion, Cas gets pulled back and tear closes. [both POV, Cas upset, self-aware]

Dean's idea (convey through pray): expel him (S04E16 Alastair's spell; separate true form with body) and immediately summon him back (S06E21 angel summoning spell; avoid true form going into heaven), let Cas possess him as vessel temporarily, use his own power fix his vessel's size, jump back into his body. talk through Ouija Board, Cas hesitates for risk of hurting Dean (possession+tear open with monsters coming) and he won't be there protecting him, doesn't mention also afraid of getting expelled and not summoned in time make him end up in Heaven, "might kill himself"

Dean insists trying, ritual works, Cas shares Dean's body but both awake, Cas use mojo to fix vessel (Dean witnesses, amazed, "so this is how it's like, internally" "that sounds so wrong but whatever") and ready to go back into it (Cas all the time quiet), Dean mentally apologize and tell him his true form is awesome before Cas goes back (talk in Dean's brain, both normal: "You really think that?" "Yeah, I do"). Cas leaves Dean's body, vessel remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, problem solved, "Welcome back."

### Cas's pieces

- trench coat/tie clothing fabric
- wing/feather
- ring/eyes
- light/grace

### Monster inspire/reference

case fic? actually all Cas

- yeti/big foot: only see footprint (~3m)
- Godzilla: biggest ~300m
- Cthulhu: humanoid, tentacles, otherworldly god, hundreds of meters
- Mega-Kaiju: (Pacific Rim) biggest ~100m
- alien, transformer, predator, king kong

real case fic source of monster (stick with basics):

- vampire
- werewolf
- leviathan
- ~~ghost~~
- ~~demon~~

### Theory/physics

Tear of dimension: leave power/energy surge/draining, break wall between spaces, free traveling around between dimensions (≈purgatory exit)

Cas's true form: multidimensional wavelength celestial being, size of Chrysler Building (319m, ~1k feet)

Why giant: true form wavelength gets twisted at the edge of dimension, think of as how light get refracted on different media interface e.g. water-air surface; or quantum physics, wave-particle dualism, wave longer after passing through smaller slit, diffraction effect

Dean: "Cas, English" Cas: "going through portal makes me giant"

Dean: "Who's dragging you away?" Cas: "Law of physics"

Dean: "Are you saying you're here, but the other part of you is still in some wormhole space?"

Cas: "In a manner of speaking, yes"

Dean: "How can I get you back, the whole complete you, not pieces of glimpses here and there" Cas: "I don't know" don't know if it's even possible, or if he really wants given the risks on Dean

Solution: needs to separate true form from vessel, expel him then bound him again, banishing+summoning spell+holy fire circle

### Reference

ominous spooky feeling: ≈P3 Sirius Black bad omen black dog (fearful but fundamentally good-natured, mysterious, suspension)

high dimension: Interstellar (2014, not released yet; current=)

#### Dean's mental state

≈S08E01-07

focus on guilty, heavy self-blame, feel crap for not getting Cas back complete

he can only save Cas if he lets go of some of that blame/guilt

mission mode, focused on saving mission

#### Cas's mental state

≈S08E07-10

focus on self-punishment, torn between dimension and true form & vessel=torn between saving heaven vs earth, choosing angel vs human, go back to purgatory for self-punishment vs go back to earth to help/protect Dean

so every time Cas fights hard to tear through dimension to get to this plane, to protect Dean, he gets more wounded and weaker in celestial part, so the fighting back itself is a step closer to the final decision point and away from torn state, so finally he can get out of the intertwined quantum superposition state, he comes back to Dean once he figure out he can only protect Dean if he forgives himself (more or less), his choice is always Dean more than anything else

**core curve**: Cas needs to really decide on the answer to "What are you, angel or human" (if angel, true form; if human, body) -> but he *is* both

#### Act 1

Dean slams on the gas hard, the stolen car roars in exhaustion, kicking up the dirt along the way. Dean rolls the window down, not caring the dirt flowing in and out. Not like they could make his face any dirtier than he already is. Not like there is any place on Earth can get any dirtier than the place he just came back from.

The night road stretches, ahead, and broad on both sides. Empty. No sight of another human being, not a single passing car. The frogs shout loudly in the bushes along the road.

Dean just stares at the road, and drives. Like it's the only thing he can think of. It's the only thing he can still trust himself to do, without causing any harm.

He drives on the freeway from the 100-miles wilderness in Maine, to west, to south, to anywhere the road leads him to. He drives, so he doesn't need to think, or talk, or eat, or sleep. As if it can just last so long, that all the things he left behind, all the things he just lost, would never catch up.

<br>

They still catch up. Of course they do. The images and sounds and smells of that filthy place. The memory of everything happened in the past year. They catch up to him and roll him over, like a snake coils around his prey before devouring the food in whole when they are still alive. Dean is the food and prey of the anaconda conjured by his own brain, made up of this bitter bloody thing called "memory".

"Dean --" He remembers Cas calling his name. Desperate. His eyes on him. His hands in his. His whole life and trust and everything he carries, all put in the hands they held together. Dean saw them all in Cas's eyes, heard them all in his voice. Dean grasped him tight, and didn't let go.

The palms were slippery with blood and sweat. Every inch of his muscle in arms and backs pained with the stress. Cas's whole weight leaned onto him. And Dean held him tight, just as desperate, like the whole world was on the hands he held, because it might as well is.

And then, it stopped. The weight disappeared. The hands loosened. They stepped over the portal together, Dean fell onto the solid ground of the sweet Earth, and two feet besides him where Cas was, it was just a blast of bright light, and then, there was nothing.

He heard Cas's scream, whether it's his human voice pitching too high or it's his shrieking angel voice, he already couldn't tell. All he saw was the silvery light of Cas's grace exploded in front of him, his last voice broken and painful. He yelled for him for the last time, then he was not there anymore. Nowhere to be found.

Dean yelled the angel's name, he would have torn the reality a hole right then and there if he knew how, just to tear open the portal again, to see if Cas fell back into the Monsterland. He would jump back into the place to get Cas back, he swore, just like he had told him, the bottom line is, they are going home together, and he wouldn't leave if Cas is not here with him.

But promises are empty, swears fall into nothing. He is here, and Castiel is not.

Dean stares hard at the front of the windshield, staring at the road so hard and rigid without blinking that it almost starts making his eyes watery. Cas should be here, by his side, sitting in the shotgun. And they should go home, together.

Dean punches the wheel, swearing and cursing. The first hint of the sunrise emerges from the end of the road, piercing right into his eyes. He blinks in the sudden light, the golden color looks nothing like Castiel's grace but light is light. Dean blinks again, the dried eyes finally condense enough moisture at the corner that threatens to drop.

Dean wipes the eyes with the back of his hands. The wetness mixes with the dirt and dried blood stains that still cover his hands, making a mess. He presses the accelerator pad harder, urging the vehicle forwards, as if he's rushing to a destination where he knows where to go.

"You are not dead, Cas." Dean growls at the empty road ahead of him. "You're not gone, I know that. Just blown away by the portal or something. I'll get you back, Cas, I promise. I can find you in the Purgatory, I'll find you again."

The car rolls ahead in a louder engine moan, speeding on the road that is lightened up by the newborn sun.

<br>

All of Sam's cellphones are offline, Dean tries every single one that he can remember, but pretty much always get a robotic voice telling him empty service or empty number, barely even any having Sam's recorded voice played out, asking for a voicemail. He tries his own old cells too, no difference.

It takes three days to track Sam down again. The patterns and old habits die hard, traces scattered around like bread crumbs. He rolls into the small town of Kermit, Texas, parking in front of the white fence house.

Thin white curtain with laces half covers the room. He glances inside.

Sam stands by a woman, holding her close. The two of them are kissing, gently. The rest of the time, they are just holding each other together, his hands on her shoulder, hers on his waist, simply having their foreheads pressed together, breathing each other's breathe, as if dancing to an old classic waltz.

The white-fence apple-pie life they had talked about, sometimes dreamed out, never once really believed can be theirs.

Dean drives away, leaving the house in his rearview. They even have flowers with small purple blossoms in the garden, poking out between the fence, in the early winter chillness of October.

Dean leaves the town after the midnight -- but not before he sneaks into the garage and drives away with his canvas-covered impala. The keys hang by the garage door.

*You get a home now, at least let me have mine.* Dean thinks, wondering for a minute how long it would even take before Sam notices the impala isn't where it was. For a brief moment, he wonders if this is exactly how Sam feels, when he spent time with Lisa right when he came back from the Cage.

He leaves the town under the starry sky, the road empty and vast like it always is these days.

<br>

#### Act 2

There are still work to do. There are always work, somewhere. Monsters, ghosts, something dark, something evil, something hiding in the dark and tearing people's heart out or drinking their blood dry.

Dean is good at finding things in the dark. But this time, he's looking for something in the light. Something bright and glaring, fluffy and feathery, something holy and angelic.

As much as he would say angels are nothing more than monsters with good PR, as many times as Cas has explained he doesn't have a harp, it seems when he thinks of Cas, he thinks of halo and wings. So that's what he looks for.

Dean gets into the habit of picking up a piece of newspaper at the breakfast and reading through. Then he sits in the cafe for a whole day going through people's mention of angelic encounters. He scans and scrolls, reads and looks, squints at the words of the witnesses and illustrations from the visionaries, thinking, if any of these is a sign of Cas. If any of them can be luckier than he is, and has a glimpse of Cas while he cannot.

Then he drives, and reads, and asks people around if there is anything weirdly holy happening, and orders the paper and cafe. Then he hits the road again.

The days and roads muffled together. Dean distantly realizes he might get as bearded and dirty as he was in Purgatory, and he decides he doesn't care. He punches the word "angel" into the laptop searching bar again.

<br>

There are some pagan gods in Wyoming, some werewolves in Michigan, and then some more pagan gods in Colorado. Dean takes care of them.

He has hoped maybe some of those pagan gods could have enough juice that he can negotiate to use. But at the end of the day, none of them are anything more than a bunch of bloodthirsty son of bitches. Dean buries the knives into their chests or cuts their heads off, whatever works.

Blood of the gods and creatures splatter onto his face. Dean gets so used to it now he doesn't flinch or blink.

Some of these days, the Earth feels no different from the Purgatory. Full of ugly things, and none of the one he's looking for.

He still prays every night. And he drives on.

By November, he has cleaned a nest of vampires in Oregon and kills a nasty spectre in Missouri. The winter is falling onto him quickly. But the coldness is the last thing he would worry.

The first snow catches him when he's in Rocky Mountain, Colorado, thinking of cutting the state in a short cut, when the blizzard almost buries half the car. He stays in a tourist center on the waist of the mountain, stuck with a group of tourists too stupid to travel without checking weather report, staring at the roaring snow outside of the window painting the whole world white and blank. Separated from the rest of the world.

There is no snow in the Purgatory. Or rain. Or sun.

Everything is just grey and bleak, trees half-dead with only trunks standing, ground covered by dirt of corroded skeletons.

So at least, if nothing else, the snow is a good reminder that this is really the Earth. Dean watches the strong wind blowing snowflakes as large as his palm onto the window, then adding layers after layers. The view soon blocked by the thick cover of snow and ice.

"No, I'm telling you, it's true, there are yetis in this mountain. Legends say they only come out in storms like this, feeding on lost hikers. The snow hides their traces too well so they are super difficult to track, but we still manage to take the photos." Some remote chatter reaches his ear. Dean focuses on the bitter coffee in his hands, trying to block out any mention of new monster or legends. He isn't really in a hunting mood right now. Coldness seeps in from the gaps of the windows.

He hears laughter from the crowd, whatever photo that man is showing around, the rest of the group isn't buying. A young woman's mocking voice is loud enough for him to hear from across the lobby:"This can't possibly be a bigfoot trace, Hector. What do you take us for, idiots? Look at the print, it's not even barefoot, might as well be a size-hundred dress shoe. Unless you're saying yetis start wearing suits and dress shoes?" The crowd bursts into laughter.

Dean lowers his head and takes another drink of his coffee that's already getting cold. Cas used to wear dress shoe. It's been a long while seeing him in the suits though, with everything so messed up and he ended up in a hospital gown that even got carried over into the other side of the portal, Dean finds himself missing that suit and funny little reversed tie.

He doesn't realize a tiny little curl starts pulling on the tip of his lips.

It's been too long. The last time they were both themselves, it's like years and years ago. Feels like decades even. Before the Purgatory, before the broken Sam, before the Leviathans, or Raphael. Long, long, time ago when he can still straight his ties, and tells Cas he's "also an FBI", only to watch the name ID got displayed upside down.

God, how he wished this is still then.

His lips drop entirely. He drinks another sip of the coffee. It's completely cold now.

"If you don't believe the photo, I guess you won't believe what I saw by my own eyes, then." The man that must is Hector insists, voice over the lingering chuckles that haven't died down. "I swear to God, on the day I take the photo, I see a yeti that is so much larger than any in the record. It must be at least sixty feet tall, and the most weird thing is its color. Not like any other white yetis, this one has a beige color, and the back standing so straight, if I don't know any better, I might say it's a giant in a trench coat."

Dean jerks up his head so fast he even startles himself. He jumps to his feet, grabbing the man by the collar before he even realizes what he's doing. "What did you say?" He scowls right into the man's face.

Hector stutters. "Chill, man. Just some story time. I was telling the ladies the other night when I was on the mountain. Just so happened to see this weird ass yeti."

"The trench coat, what's it like?" Dean shakes his collar, the man is practically raised to his toes like a cat picked up by the neck.

"Are you crazy? I don't know, just a trench coat. I mean, it's probably nothing, lights and reflections or something." Hector protests and pushes at his shoulder.

Dean lets him go. "And you say he's on top of the mountain in a snow storm like this one?"

"*He*?" Hector flattens his wrinkled clothes, laughing, "Yeah, sure, on the highest top, surrounding a big pile of fire with cooked human meat, dancing with other female yetis!" The group of tourists burst into a huge outburst of laughter.

Dean turns around, walking straight towards the door.

"Sir, it's too dangerous to go outside in this weather." One of the workers of the place calls after him.

Dean doesn't look back. "I'm going." He says.

<br>

#### Act 3

It's freezing cold outside. In fact, "freezing" is just too weak of a term for this temperature. Any word that can be thought of for this weather has already been blown away by the blizzard and frozen into the ground.

Dean can sense every inch of skin is dropping temperature fast, he might only have minutes, or seconds, before he may literally frozen to death -- if he's not buried alive first.

But knowing what he knows now, there is no way he would just sit inside and do nothing. He can fight through the Purgatory from one end to the other, certainly he can survive some snow storm in Colorado.

Dean walks into the storm, and starts walking towards the mountaintop, where the rumors hold. The snowflakes are as sharp as blades, cutting him bloody, but there is no dripping blood. Even the sliced veins are frozen to contact the minute they're wounded.

He can't see anything, there is nothing other than a whole complete whiteness in front of him, with all kinds of different sharpness and shades. He pushes one step after another, but can't tell the difference between each step. He wonders if he's really moving up, or just making the same movement in the same place.

The storm gets more fierce when the top is nearer. The trees are getting sparse, the color of the snow darker. Dean widens his eyes to the biggest extend, searching the sky, the ground, the wood, the mountain. Searching the whole world for a glimpse of color that is different from the whiteness. Looking for a footprint or a hint of beige.

"This is just suicide, Dean." The voice he's way too familiar with sounds up somewhere close by.

"Cas?" Dean spins around, turning sharp towards the sound.

"Dangerous, reckless, and stupid. You could die here, buried alive, and I'd never find you or your corpse again, you ever thought about that?" Cas's voice scolding.

"What?" Dean stills. Thinking, then tries, "You're not real, aren't you? I'm hallucinating you?"

"Hypothermia could lead to highly realistic hallucination. It's scientifically tested and confirmed already." "Cas" walks out of the storm, standing in front of him. In his clean trench coat and straight suit, blue tie tilted and reversed in the front. Hairs unbelievably disheveled but not moving in the storm wind. Eyes as blue as the deepest sea and highest autumn sky. The view of the angel of the lord as he remembered from the first time they met, the look he forever dreamed about among all the other looks that he had.

"Cas." Dean murmurs, reaching out to him, fingers catching nothing but snowflakes. Though the snow doesn't feel cold anymore.

He puts a sad smile, looking at "Cas" in the eyes. "I've been looking for you, Cas. Promised I'd find you and bring you home. But looks like I can't even keep that promise, I'm sorry."

"Cas" has a smile just as sad as his. "You're dying, Dean." He tells him, then. "And I won't allow that happen."

Dean can't really think straight right now, the low temperature makes his brain as sluggish as his hands and feet, working slower by each second, just like the gradually slowing down heart beat sound that he hears of his own.

That is when the view in front of his eyes changes entirely. Dean blinks slowly, can't understand what he's seeing.

It is as if the storm is split into half, like a curtain drawing open on the opera stage. A figure as tall as sky emerges, stepping towards him slowly. Each step stomping on the ground, shaking the earth, like the giant from the Jack and Beanstalk story.

Dean wants to step back, wants to look up, wants to speak. There are so many things he wants to do, the instinct is telling him to run away, or to fight, but his body is too frozen to move. So he just stares, feeling the newly risen adrenalin forcing the heart beating faster. His brain struggles to parse the reality and the view.

The figure wears a long trench coat, reaching to his knees, which is taller than the highest tree in their surroundings. Dean looks up, head as high as his frozen neck allows but still can't see the head of the figure. He gasps, his sound choked in his throat.

It is Cas. It is undoubtedly Cas. But it is so unlike Cas, not in any form they have ever known. Not in any history or legend. But it is Cas, for sure.

Dean would know him from anywhere, in any form. Not just the trench coat, but his existence. The weight of his stare falling on to him even if he can't see his eyes; the heat of concern radiating from his body, almost practically melting the snow and ice surround them. And most of all, who else would ever like this, always comes to him at the moment of dying. Hell is the first time, Green Room the second, Dean has long lost count of how many more are there.

"Cas." This time Dean really is smiling now. Dirt and snow and hint of blood and cuts smudged on his face, making the smallest of pull of muscle a pain, but he's smiling now, big and stupidly.

He steps forward, but Cas retracts. There is a thunderous sound rolling from above, as if coming directly from the sky, low and deafening, like the rage of Greek gods on top of the Olympics Mount.

But it's not a voice of rage, nor warning. Dean can't understand the syllable, but if he knows Cas at all -- which he does -- then he'd know, this is his own name. He would have known his own name in every single tongue Cas knows, and the tone would remain the same.

He takes another step forward, carefully, but Cas's figure takes another step back. The blizzard around them starts roaring again, reaching back to the same amount of intensity and fierceness. But surround Dean, there is still a safe little area of warmth, blocked out from Cas's body.

"What's wrong?" Dean manages, sound covered by the blizzard the moment they leave his mouth.

Cas makes another sound, one word, not "Dean", certainly not "Hello".

"No, no, no, no! Cas!" Dean yells, desperate, "Wait! Don't! Not 'Goodbye' again! Not so soon!"

Cas turns around. That is when he sees it. A tear in the space, like a big ugly wound of the reality standing vertical, opening up like Sauron's evil eye glaring down at the earth. Grey and black smoke flowing in and out of the edge, like curtains flying in the wind. The blizzard starts right from the center of it.

"Cas..." Dean hates it he can't do anything, especially when he knows exactly what is going to happen next, the same nightmare that he's been having for ages, after the day of the Cage opening, after Cas walking into the river. The same worst thing he feared every single night at the Purgatory, and it seems, with Cas, it's just gonna keep replaying.

Cas is right in front of that huge tear of the dimension now. Bright light start leaking out from him, seeping into the opening, weaving onto it like needles and threads fixing a patch on a piece of cloth.

"Please..." Dean begs, so quiet even himself can barely hear it. Cas's figure starts fade, lights dimming, the hole shrinking. But right before it gets completely sewed up by the bright light of grace, a slicker thread of light flies away from the rest, flying towards Dean.

Dean watches it, not realizing his eyes are so teary that the light of the grace is all fuzzed and smudged like a piece of water soaked art. The thread of light fly onto his forehead, touches his skin and immediately sinks into it.

The warmth soaks him from top to bottom, chasing the last hint of coldness from the snow storm out of his body. The exact same feeling whenever Cas touches him and heals him.

Dean looks up again. At the place where the tear of the space was, it is now a clean smooth stand of sky, and air. There is no nasty thing from other dimension, there is no bright light of needles and threads.

There is no Cas, again. Except for the lingering warmth that still flows in his body.

The snow storm has stopped, he realizes, when the tear is fixed.

<br>

#### Act 4

It is dark.

This place.

It is shredding.

Cutting.

Confusing.

Everything is pieces.

Just pieces.

Floating.

Chaotic.

The dimension in between.

<br>

It takes time, really long time to find the pieces together.

But what is time, when time is not a dimension.

When time, can also be torn apart, like everything else, in this dimension.

Words are difficult to find, with characters and syllables.

Mind and body and grace and existence.

Which is the right place, for which piece of puzzle, floating by.

Woven, with the pain and bitter and guilt and penance.

Kneading, into every fabric.

Every fabric of the dimension.

Of my existence.

Who is building me up this time?

Not God. Me.

I'm putting me together.

But, then, Theseus's Ship,

Who am I?

<br>

It is dark.

Behind the curtain.

Lights are out.

Tear it down.

The voice says.

Tear it open, the light is on the other side.

<br>

Then,

Snow and cold.

Pain and real.

<br>

Hello.

Sorry.

The lights are out again.

The curtain is drawn back.

Good night.

### Chap. 2 (Harpy)

> **Outline:** Dean follows giant monster witness report, rumor says Archaeopteryx (ancient first bird fossil) in place with huge tall trees (Redwood, California). Dean drives there, gets spooked, feels being watched but no one around, thinks he sees shape of giant Cas's wings in night black but disappear in blink (only get a glimpse), thinks he's going crazy, finds another tear of dimension and bloody feather in it (too big). almost gets killed by Greek creature Harpy (half-human half-bird, eat human, decapitation) and gets saved by Cas, protected by six huge black wings (Cas wants to talk but only in true voice and too loud, breaks glasses, but Dean is sure by now it's Cas), Cas gets pulled away again as the tear closes [+Cas POV: can't talk, can't stay, self-aware weird shape, watch Dean from the other side, see him hurt and fight to force through to save, weakened by each attempt]

### Chap. 3 (Missouri)

> **Outline:** Dean goes to Missouri, Pamela's seance had witnessed Cas's true form in multidimension then so can Missouri (use feather/coat fabric as medium), Dean gets info hint that Cas's true form and vessel are spliced and he's stuck, swears to find&help him. [+Cas POV: meet with Missouri in seance/spirit dimension, can talk/see, hesitant to come back because not want to continue tear dimension to endanger reality&Dean]

### Chap. 4 (Cthulhu)

> **Outline:** Dean drives around, keeps getting spooky feeling of continuously being watched, hears local legend of Cthulhu (humanoid, huge, tentacle, hundreds of meters tall) in Alaska, sees weird/astonishing aurora lights on sky, drives there. midnight, empty road, tear opens, sees giant Cas manifest in full size right in front of impala, wings+rings with eyes+trench coat, leviathans also come through the tear. Dean shocked/terrified/in awe then busy fighting, giant Cas kills them (easier than normal size but easily tired). Dean&Cas grab a few moments to talk/sync (the physics theory behind), Cas worries his reaction at first, Dean needs time to adjust, sees him for real now, not react/communicate well. Cas sensitive, feel rejected/upset, afraid Dean disgust/fear his true form now, self-aware being monster. Cas gets weaker quickly for staying in this dimension talking for long, fighting against natural order, and with the tear more leviathans coming through. For Dean's safety and Cas's own exhaustion, Cas gets pulled back and tear closes. [both POV, Cas upset, self-aware]

### Chap. 5 (Ritual+reunion)

> **Outline:** Dean's idea (convey through pray): expel him (S04E16 Alastair's spell; separate true form with body) and immediately summon him back (S06E21 angel summoning spell; avoid true form going into heaven), let Cas possess him as vessel temporarily, use his own power fix his vessel's size, jump back into his body. talk through Ouija Board, Cas hesitates for risk of hurting Dean (possession+tear open with monsters coming) and he won't be there protecting him, doesn't mention also afraid of getting expelled and not summoned in time make him end up in Heaven, "might kill himself"
>
> Dean insists trying, ritual works, Cas shares Dean's body but both awake, Cas use mojo to fix vessel (Dean witnesses, amazed, "so this is how it's like, internally" "that sounds so wrong but whatever") and ready to go back into it (Cas all the time quiet), Dean mentally apologize and tell him his true form is awesome before Cas goes back (talk in Dean's brain, both normal: "You really think that?" "Yeah, I do"). Cas leaves Dean's body, vessel remains lifeless for a bit, Dean worries, then Cas back. Reunion, hug, problem solved, "Welcome back."
