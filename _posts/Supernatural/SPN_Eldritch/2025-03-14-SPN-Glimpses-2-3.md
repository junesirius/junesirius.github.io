A loud flutter of wings adds to the sounds of millions of wings crashing and rustling, so loud and strong it distinguishes itself from all the other wings. A powerful gust sweep through, sending the vultures that perch on his back with claws digging into spine blown away. The ones pecking his arms lose their grip too, spreading their wings to keep some balance. The edge and feathers of the wings brush on the opening wounds, sending his body involuntary shudders.

The surrounding sounds a lot quieter suddenly. For a second, Dean thinks if it might be his ears suddenly deafened, like a TV player muted all of a sudden. But then he realizes the sound of wings are still there, but further away, like behind a closed sound-proof door. The sensation of feathers and wings are still on his skin -- which, looks like he has skin again, on the places that he's sure bleeding like drained pipe mere seconds ago.

The broken bones start growing back, the cut tendon connecting together, blood flowing through the veins smoothly, the skin feels new and tight. The burning and wet sensation recedes, so does the freezing dumbing sensation. There is only a lingering familiar lukewarm touch on the skin exposed through the torn cloth, a fluffy sensation that is barely there.

It is not the vulture wings that touched him. It is not.

Dean opens his eyes, lowering his arms. He is surrounded by something warm and huge, wrapping him up like the best natural feathery quilt, covering him from head to toe like a cocoon, but with enough space to move too, not confining, but safe. No one could ever hurt him from here, he knows instantly, not vultures, not any monster, not even God or Death themselves, Dean just knows.

It is dark, but through the faint flashlight that he dropped on the ground inches away by his feet, he sees the wings around him isn't pure black. It's glittering tiny little shine of silvery light, like the finest diamond inlayed in between the feathers.

Dean doesn't need anything else to know who it is.

"Cas." He reaches out a hand, can't help himself.

For a blink of time, he imagines there is nothing, just another dying hallucination, just the last warm dream like the Little Match Girl. But his fingertips land on the feathers. Soft on the tip, tender on the middle, strong on the root, disarranged in his touch. He takes a long breathe in, and he smells sky.

"Cas, is that really you? This is your wings?" His voice is still a bit shivering, wet. "So you're -- you're okay. More than okay. The wings, oh God, I never know it looks like this, up close, I mean."

He takes another long drag of broken breathe, feeling his heartbeat finally start to slow down, his brain dizzy from the adrenaline. Dean murmurs, quietly, "They're so beautiful, Cas. They're amazing."

He puts both palms on the wings in front of him, feeling the warmth that is slightly higher than his own passing onto the hollow of his palms. He might be imagining it, but underneath it, he feels a pulse. A live, pumping, steady pulse, beating in the rhythm of an elephant's heartbeat, the slow pace of a giant creature. He buries his fingers in, letting the feathers intertwine with the fingers, watching them part to allow his fingers sinking deeper into the sea of black feathers. For this moment, Dean feels secure, even if he knows he must be far from it, even if in his whole life, he has never ever been.

"This giant ancient bird Artemis told me about, thousands of miles wide and thousands of miles tall, stirring sea and sky, it's you, isn't it?" Dean tries hard to steady his breathe, feeling proud. "I know it! I know it all along."

Cas doesn't answer.

In fact, Cas hasn't said a word or even showed his face, it is only the wings that Dean sees.

Only then does he realize, and start frowning. "Cas, buddy, I want to see you. What happened? Come down here, talk to me."

There is a high-pitched voice in a thunderous volume rolling above his head, piercing through the air in answer. The same sound that blew up the glasses in the gas station shop on the day he crawled out of the grave, back on Earth from the Pit tour. Castiel's true voice.

Dean covers his ear until the voice and echo between trees silences. "You can't speak human now?" He guesses, then adds quickly. "Okay let's do this, knock once for no, knock twice for yes, we'll figure out other things later. Right or wrong, Cas? True-voice-only time?"

The wing wrapped closest to him moves, pulling away from him, the tip of it knocks on the ground twice.

Dean lets out a relieved chuckle. "Now we're talking. Good to see you again, Cas." He talks to the black wings in front of him, gesturing vaguely upwards, start feeling weird. "Some part of you, anyway."

He tilts his head, "Hey, what's the deal with this *Amazing Colossal Man* show?"

Dean looks up, but can't seem to look beyond where Cas's wings cover. He can't tell if the blackness over his head is the wing or the night.

The tip of the wing that was responsible to knock on the ground as an answer hesitates. It draws on the ground in a curve, then a point -- a question mark.

Dean can practically hear Cas's voice -- his low grave human voice -- saying "I don't understand that reference" just from that movement.

He can't help feeling a pull at the corner of his mouth. "Anyway, thanks for saving my ass, again. You have any idea what's the matter with those killer birds out there?"

The hesitation again. Dean watches the wing tip shift around like a human wresting fingers in the grill of a difficult question. But then, it taps twice on the ground.

Dean claps his hands, "Great! Mind show me?"

There is a brief high-pitched growling sound overhead again. Still completely unrecognizable by his human ears, but somehow, Dean thinks, he senses something edgy and pained just from the sound of it. His heart clutches at the feeling of it, even if he has no idea of the meaning.

"Or not, if it's... making you uncomfortable." He tries.

Slowly, the wrapped layers of wings around him withdraw. From outside to the innermost circle where the feathers slightly brush on his back and shoulders, they unfold. One wing after another.

There are three pairs.

As tall as the redwoods surrounding them, as wide as the opening space allow. From where Dean stands, he can't see from one end to the other, and his human brain can't seen to comprehend the shape in between that hold the wings together. Must be something celestial, he decides, something that *is* true Cas.

The wings flap once, three pairs together. A gusty blow of strong wind sweeps across the woods, shaking the trunks and crowns, leaves falling like a downpouring rain, those vultures that were as big as half his height and with wings longer than his arms, just get blown away like small gnats puffed away by a huff, finally leaving a small circle of clearing. But he can hear them steady and ready to fly back any time now.

Cas flaps his wings again. Then a third time.

But even he can't do that forever.

By each flap, his wings shift the direction, blowing the gust into all directions, circling around something.

Something too dark to be made out in the night forest. Dean points the flashlight in that direction, widening his eyes then squinting, looking hard, trying to see what is in there.

Then he sees it. The tear in the space, not too different from the one he saw last time when Cas emerges in the snow storm, but the tear was easier to be noticed in the all white background than the all black one as of now.

But it is the same wound of the reality, an opening leading to somewhere unknown. The vultures are produced from the opening faster than shooting bullets, flying and dashing out like the annoyest insect in the world.

Judging by the speed of wings' movement, Cas is tiring out fast. He retreats closer to the gap step by step. Dean tries to move towards him.

Cas lowers one of the lowest wings, putting it right in his way, sending the clear enough message of warning him another step forward. And Dean can see why. There are too many killer birds in the center, if the ones attacking him earlier are giving him a hard time, going any closer could mean being torn apart by the tornado of birds' beak in an instant. Not even Cas can heal him fast enough if that ever happens, he considers.

He stays where that wing instructs him to. The feeling of helplessness comes back. The same feeling when he was in that snow storm, the same gut instinct of what is going to happen next as the wings approach the tear closer and closer.

"You're leaving again, aren't you?" Dean asks him, frowning deep, eyes sting. Not expecting any answer, because they both already know.

The wing tip bends slightly, wrapping around him briefly -- the closest thing to a farewell hug. A feather brushes his face, right where the corner of his eyes is. Dean swallows. There is no tear, he knows there isn't, not now anyway.

His hand reaches up, feeling the touch of the feather, leaning into it.

"Did the Purgatory do this to you? Pulling you here and there? Making these whatever weirdass portals all over? God, I have so many questions." Dean feels the twist in his stomach tightens, the tie turning over. He thinks he's gonna be sick.

His voice quieter. "Do you choose to leave, or do you have to, Cas?" He pushes the words out, tasting the edge of them, each as sharp as the knives and blades and the beaks of those birds, cutting his tongue and throat bloody. "I fight so damn hard, just want you back, want you stay, want you okay. Is that too much to ask?"

The shrieking angelic voice that answers him is even more pained than the previous one he heard. Dean can't imagine what is it Cas is saying.

The vultures gather back closer as Cas's wings flapping incrementally slower and visibly more exhausted and heavy. One of them land the claws on his wings in the mid sky, more followed. A burst of new smell of copper and iron outburst in the air.

Dean yells, "Cas, watch out!" But there is nothing he can do. Some of the birds hovers back, diving in his direction. Feet away, then inches away.

That is when Cas starts glowing. Not too different from last time on the snow mountain, except a lot more intense. Dean shuts his eyes the moment those lights start brightening up, starting from the outline of the wings.

His brain itches to steal a look, to see the wings in light, he imagines it like phoenix reborning in fire (a drastic light show as the legend about that tremendous bird would be like, not the man-like monster back in wild west time), but Cas would definitely be pissed -- pissed at himself, that is -- if Dean gets his eyes burned out because of some stupid curiosity.

The bright light burns the back of his eyelid hot and red, like facing straight at the sun with closed eyes. He waits, feeling the heart pounding loudly in his chest. He listens, the sounds of wings wane and subside, the warm and soft touch of feathers leaves.

Dean opens his eyes when he can't hear any more flutter. His view still stimulates and shakes with a too bright overlay, making the dark scene before him even harder to see. He blinks and rubs his eyes, clearing the water conjuring slowly that must be triggered from the bright light, not because the breathless feeling inside the chest.

There is no scar of space left, there is no giant black wing. No killer man-eating vulture. No Cas.

A crow tentatively croaks, jumping on the grass, then flies away. That is all.

In the place where there was the opening, on the ground, lying on top the thick coating of fallen leaves, there is a single long feather.

As long as his forearm. As black as the starry sky with glittering light in between. A hint of blood stained the end.

Cas's feather.

Dean's fingers caress the feather, ever so softly, so lightly. Just like the way the wings it belonged to touching his cheek mere moments ago. Ever so gently. The touch of a phantom hand, coming from a distant forgotten dream.

He presses the feather onto his lips, then puts it next to the piece of trench coat fabric. His heart beats a skin's distance away.
