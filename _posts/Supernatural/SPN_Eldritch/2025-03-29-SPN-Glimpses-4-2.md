---

Dean stays awake the whole night driving away from Topeka, Kansas, running as far away as possible. But the memory of that messed-up illusion world doesn't take it easy on him for the sake of the distance.

The distortion and deformation of Cas's body, of his wings, haunts in his view. The stretch of the road ahead of him is barely lit by the car's headlamp. In the unlit dark corners, he sees the illusion replaying itself at the periphery of his eyes. One version after another, all variations of Cas's figure show up, always troubled, always torn and broken, always wounded and helpless, standing in the corner of his view, disappearing the moment he moves his head toward him trying to look properly. Cas is never there. But the figures always are.

He hears Cas's voice too, now that the fake world just reminded him of that grave deep voice he doesn't realize how much he misses. The sound takes root in his brain, speaking at his ear, sometimes from afar, other times as if he's right next to him, sitting at the shotgun, reading a piece of news on some paper, or saying some silly everyday conversation.

Dean has to turn his head to the shotgun half a dozen times to see the seat empty.

The lack of sleep only makes it worse.

Dean distantly wonders if it is how it's like, back when Sam or Cas gets that craziness tumor in their brain. Seeing and hearing Lucifer has to be worse than seeing and hearing Cas everywhere. He decides, somehow slightly comforted by the thought.

He jams on the brake when he thinks the sight of Cas is walking alongside the road, too vivid, but only in a flash. He stares out of the window for a whole storming night, because for a blink of time, he swears Cas stands right there. He crashes the car when he thinks there is a bloody figure wrapped in trench coat lying unconsciously in the middle of the road. But the figure disappears when he climbs out of the car bleeding. The figures always disappear if he blinks hard enough.

Cas is in the dimension in between, not here. Dean has to remind himself, over and over again, when he tosses himself a whole night, or stitches himself over after the crash, or fixes the car. He doesn't know if that brief meeting time in the seance is making everything better or worse. Now that he knows where Cas is, how horrible that place is, but he still can't find him or get to him, it is not helping anything at all except for crushing his heart like a bloody hand keeps squeezing it.

The nightmares are getting worse too after that, like a dam in his brain gets torn down, creating imagination he never has and never needs. In the rare times he dozes off, the dreams become increasingly vivid and disturbing. Always with Cas being hurt one way or another, in one place or another. He dreams about his wings broken and burned, twisted and torn, feathers dropping out and floating everywhere, his body split to pieces, then spliced back wrong. The Cas in his dream, whatever shape he's in, he still always, always holds that pair of bright blue eyes, looking at him. So he would know, it is Cas that is being deformed in all the ways, but whatever the change, it is still him, and he is still in there, able to feel and sense everything. The pain, the brokenness, the disorientation. It only makes the view a million times worse.

Unnerving. Horrifying. Even for him. Even considering everything in his life.

Dean goes to a crossroad, and buries a box with his photo in it.

The demon shows up as a young pretty blondie.

Dean glances at her tiredly, eye rims red, the demon blade loosely in his right hand.

"Dean Winchester," the demon looks him up and down, grinning. "It's been a while. Last time you made a deal -- yourself for your brother, what is it you want this time? Or rather, who is it you want to exchange your life for?"

He swallows, hating it's being so obvious.

"First thing first, can you reach other dimensions?"

"I might." The demon says casually.

"This is a yes-or-no question, you son of a bitch. Can you or can you not?" Dean growls.

"And my answer is, I might." The demon doesn't flinch. "Now it's your turn, either you trust me, or you don't."

Dean is deflated. "What do you want in return? Ten years?"

"That would be too good to be true, isn't it?" The demon smiles a cheap smile, tsking. "We both know Hell can't hold you, and as soon as your boyfriend is topside, he'd just fetch you out of there anyway."

Dean puffs. "Then what?"

"What about --" The demon makes a contemplating postures, "I get him out, then you jump in?"

"What?" Dean glares at her.

"Would be a lot more fun, isn't it? Somewhere out of reach. Then we can wait and see how he would deal with it and tear everything down to get to you, just like how you are now."

As disgust as the demon is, she's right, Dean realizes. He'd just make Cas feel as awful as he is now. Just like that sick feeling when he learned about Dad's deal with the Yellow-Eye. God knows what Cas would do to handle that misery. Dude has blasted the Purgatory open once, he might even tears the whole multidimension down if he can find Dean that way -- hell, *he* wants to do that too, if only he's not a powerless human. But Cas, Cas might actually can and will.

"He'd smite your brain out the first thing." Dean replies.

The demon smirks, "Worth it, pity you wouldn't be there to watch it or see how broken he'd be. Or maybe, I'll make sure he hears every bit of detail how you made the deal, just to crush that delicate angel heart, before killing him permanently when he's grieving."

Dean growls, marching ahead with the demon blade raised high. The demon takes a hurried step back, "Easy tiger, there is still a terrifying little girl in here, you wouldn't harm her, would you?"

Dean pauses, lowering the blade, but the killing look in his eyes doesn't recede. "I'll just separate your demonic true form from the body then."

The words slip out without second thinking, but the moment it reaches his ear, it makes an awakening drumming so loud that he startles himself and has to steady his step to not stumble.

*Separating the true form from the body.* Didn't Cas say his main problem is the true form being spliced with the body, that's what makes him giant and stuck in that dimension? So what if there is a way to separate them for him, and putting them back together right, like breaking the malunited bones for them to be fixed correct after.

He eyes the demon in front of him, and has a better idea.

<br>

The Gas'n'Sip rings a small bell when the door is pushed open. The store is empty with only a girl in leather jacket and brunette hair standing in front of the register, checking out some gums and snacks. She doesn't look up because the cashier is handing her the changes.

A man approaches her from behind, a blade jabbed at her back, hidden by a jacket, voice low. "We need to talk."

Meg snorts a laughter, doesn't bother looking back. "Dean. Nice to see you too. Aren't you going to buy me some dinner first?"

"Sure, the drink will be holy water." Dean's tone flat, "Now, walk."

They end up stopping by a deserted factory.

"I got to ask, Dean, how did you even find me?" Meg asks, genuinely curious. "Thought I laid low enough."

"A little bird told me." Dean deadpans.

"You mean you tortured a demon." Meg reads his blank face. "Just to find me? You do know how to flatter a girl."

Dean ignores her. "What do you know about angel expelling spell?"

"Angelic exorcism? Why, trouble in paradise?" Meg looks truly intrigued now. "Cas pissed you off so mad you're gonna banish him to Heaven? That's surely more fascinating than Saturday night soup opera."

"Not like that." The thought of Cas leaving for Heaven makes his stomach twist. Dean shifts his feet.

"Care to elaborate?" Meg raises her eyebrows.

"Not your business." Dean bites out. "Now, spell." He waves the demon knife in a way that makes his point clear.

"Fine," Meg looks away, dropping the smile. "I did learn a thing or two during my time with Yellow-Eyes, Azazel never used it, but Alastair can't shut up showing off. I wasn't there but I heard he really enjoyed trying the spell on a certain angel when they first walked the Earth after two thousand years, not long before he got burned clean once and for all."

Dean looks at her intensely. "Which angel did he use the spell on?" Memory of the day Alastair died was still all too clear. That's also the devastating day of knowing he was the one who jump started the apocalypse, the day Sam killed the demon just by his freaking mind.

"Our beloved Castiel, of course." Meg answers lightly.

Dean feels sick. But he remembers Cas was still there, when he woke up from the beat in the hospital. He was too caught up in his own thoughts to check him properly, but now that he thinks back, Cas might looked a little pale but he was okay. At least Cas was still there by his bedside, which means either the spell wasn't finished, or he got banished back to Heaven but came back unharmed.

"Just, tell me the words." He tries hard to push away the image of Alastair holding his dirty demon hand on Cas's throat, incantating the angel exorcism spell. Cas's eyes would probably shine bright and white, his grace and essence would fly upwards until they reach the Heaven, if Heaven still wanted him in. He can't imagine how the first apocalypse would have ended if Cas wasn't there for him.

"*Omnipotentis Dei potestatem invoco! Ab orbe terra, Hunc angelum omne obsequendum! Domine expuet, Ut Deum ad empyreum remittat!*" Meg recites the Latin verses.

Dean memorizes the whole thing. He tries not to think about he is just about to do the same thing to Cas that Alastair has done before.

"Any side effect I need to know about?" Dean asks.

Meg shrugs slightly. "From the spell? No." She pauses there, leaving something unsaid hanging in the air.

"What?" Dean stares at her clear hesitance, demanding.

"But whatever you're about to do, I'm sure it's gonna end ugly." Meg says, not unkindly, just stating the obvious. "It's just how things with you Winchesters always are. You sure you don't want to tell me the whole story? Have you ever considered, *maybe* I can help?"

"What do you care? You are a demon." Dean frowns.

"That hurts my feeling, Dean. In case you haven't noticed, I do care," Meg raises her voice exaggeratedly, "and I've been good to you."

"You've been good to *you*." Dean retorts.

"Wouldn't have done that 'bursting into the Death Star in the front door so you and the angel can find Dick Roman' move if it's just *me* I'm caring, would I?" Meg reminds him, "And don't forget, when I took care of Cas for months when he lost his noodle, where were you?"

Dean swallows uneasily. He meets Meg's eyes, the unsaid obvious thing swirling in there, deep and shiny. Meg raises her eyebrows in challenge.

So he tells her.

Not everything, not much details, but at least now she has the idea, the Purgatory, the dimension in between, the deformation. "So, all the fun things." She concludes. She's been listening quietly without interruption.

Dean talks more than he can remember in months. For a short moment, it feels nice. It feels easy. He even feels... understood, as if of all the people in the whole world, somehow, *Meg* is the one who knows what he's talking about. It surprises him.

He leaves out the parts with the djinns and nightmares.

Meg bites her lips when Dean stops talking, deep in thinking.

Dean eyes her face. "Spit it out."

Meg shoots him a look, "Why am I not surprised you managed to break him and lose him *again*, bravo."

Dean turns around and ready to head out. "Okay that's enough, I don't need someone to make me feel shittier than I already am."

"But I get it." Meg's voice behind his back says, gentler, "That plan of yours, it might actually work."

Dean turns back. "You think?"

Meg nods, not in any joking tone anymore. "I know. Angels are more like demons than humans in a way, so call me a professional in that. We need to possess bodies to walk the Earth, so do they. But banishing from the body and summoning him back, it's like pulling a heart out of chest and shoving it back in before it stops beating. You miss the timing, you're stuck with a corpse."

Dean swallows again, forcing a light voice. "Guess I'll have to time it right then, no problem."

"A million problems can go wrong," Meg says, "but I admire you human's blind hope. There is another catch."

Dean sighs. "Of course there is."

"You'll probably die." Meg tells him, flat. "And knowing it's you, I wouldn't bother with the 'probably', you are definitely going to die."

Dean narrows his eyes. "I didn't see that in the fine prints of the spell."

"Oh not the spell. Assuming Cas is saved, bla bla, happy reunion. But you forget about that tear." Meg meets his gaze. "You haven't really thought about how to fix a dimension, have you?"

Dean falls quiet. Then, "What's that gotta do with my death?"

"Everything." Meg takes a breath, as if what she's going to say next is a big thing even for her. "Because death is an infinite vessel."

Dean raises his eyebrows in question.

"From what you said, the tear makes everything on the edge infinite. It touches one snow flake and it becomes the biggest snow storm; touches one bird and becomes countless killer birds --"

"The *Infinity Mirror Effect*," Dean murmurs in realization. "Cas told me about it, but I didn't really understand what's that mean."

And now he does, loud and clear. An infinite vessel to contain the infinite disasters that fall through, a patch to the tear that keeps dragging Cas away, pulling him back into that painful dark dimension. Death, being the ultimate solution to the rule of physics. Somehow, he can almost see the beauty in it.

The solution to bringing Cas home.

"I'll do it." Dean says, a small smile starts sprouting on his lips. The first real smile in months, maybe years.

"I know you will." Meg nods once, holds out a hand as if trying to pat him on the shoulder, but takes it back on second thought before touching.

"Thanks, I guess." She says instead.

Dean doesn't ask what for.
