The theoretical explanations that Dean cuts off but Cas would have explained, if anyone is curious:

**Refraction**: Think of when you poke a finger into a glass of water and look from the side, the finger looks bended and twisted. It's caused by the different materials being different medium for the light, and they have different speeds of light, thus different wavelengths. It's the same when the angel's true form wavelength passes through the boundary between two dimensions: each dimension is a different media, with unique property and speed for wave to pass. The wavelength gets changed and twisted, that's why Cas's figure becomes stretched and enlarged to a deformed shape.

**Diffraction**: The quantum mechanics effect that if a microcosmic particle passes through a slit that is in the similar order of magnitudes with the particle size, the particle would diffract into uncertain location (*Uncertainty Principle*) with a mathematical distribution of likelihood where it may end up to. The smaller the slit, the larger range it could potentially end up with. The tear in the space is of similar size of Cas in the form of wavelength, so Cas suffers from the Diffraction Effect, that's why he could potentially end up anywhere with no control of where he would land, only with a statistical likelihood to estimate.

**Infinity Mirror Effect**: If an item is positioned in between two perfectly aligned parallel mirrors, then there will be infinite reflections of the same item inside the mirrors. This is to explain the phenomenon they witness when a tear is opened to the dimension in between, explains why the cases are the strongest snow storm ever, the infinite number of vultures, and the craziest aurora borealis. The items that end up in between the dimension and get infinitely reflected are the most normal, natural things -- one snow flake, one harmless bird, one plasma particle. But duplicate them by infinity (each of them identical), it would definitely become a disaster. For the story's purpose, also twisted them a little to make them extremely deadly.

**Wave-Matter Duality**: Angel's true form is a type of wave, the human vessel is a physical matter, therefore according to classical physics, they are fundamentally different forms and no way to find a grand unification to integrate them well. But according to quantum physics, there is Wave-Matter Duality to unify them: every matter is a wave, only differs in the length of the wave and frequency of the matter. Therefore in a sense, the human body is also a wave with limited wavelength, that explains why angel can reside into the body and occupies and moves around in it. Also explains why Jimmy said having an angel inside is like flying with a comet -- the short wavelength of human matter has a difficult time catching up with long wavelength angels.

And if we do the reverse calculation, it would mean angel's size as a physical matter would be extremely small according to the long wavelength. That is why angel has to possess human to walk the Earth, otherwise they would simply be too small to be seen.

Taking all that into consideration, it means when Cas said his true form size is as big as the Chrysler Building, that would be referring to his wavelength. Now it's a calculation problem, a wave with a wavelength of about three hundred meters long, it means the frequency is 1MHz, that falls within the range of Medium Frequency (MF) for things like AM radio broadcastings, coast guards, no wonder he can tune in to police radio as well.

Using *de Broglie's equation*, to have this wavelength, it would mean a proton moving at a $10^{-9}$ m/s or an electron moving at $10^{-6}$ m/s. So if Cas doesn't occupy a body and manifest as a physical existence on the Earth, he would have to be extremely small or extremely slow. Angel or not, he's bounded by the rule of physics.

**Mass-Energy Equivalence**: According to the famous Einstein's equation $E=mc^2$, the mass can be converted to energy in equivalence, with multiplied vacuum speed of light. So the process of shrinking Cas's spliced giant body from the size of Chrysler Building to Jimmy Novak's height, considering the height ratio creating increased mass proportionally in three dimensions, would eventually produce approximately $3.85*10^{25}$ Joules of energy, which is about 600 millions times more powerful than the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful nuclear bomb ever detonated. We wouldn't want to have him anywhere near downtown area, so it's glad all the occurrences of the cases are all quite remote, and Alaska is so very ideal, second only to totally desolated deserts. Let's just say this much energy is enough to feed a hole and patch a tear in the dimension.

**The dimension in between**: The "dimension in between" is not any *single* dimension, not a higher or lower dimension, not fifth dimension or tenth dimension. It's a concept where other dimensions are flattened, including the time and space dimension. It's like two and a half dimension, or three and a half, or all the other in-between dimensions put together.

In there, all the world in all the time and all the space would be equivalent, as if they are all happening in the same time same place. That is why when Cas is in there, when he notices the lights conjured from Dean's yearnings, he would wonder when and where that is. Because they can be from any time, any where, Cas wouldn't be able to tell the difference. He may tear one hole to find a 26-year-old Dean, another to 40-year-old Dean. That is also why it is a very real fear that Dean worries "what if the next time you show up it's 20 years later, then 50 years after". This can happen very easily, if not the now-Dean yearns the hardest.

That is also why the infinite future can actually fill the hole and close the dimension in between: the future and the past are equivalent in there. The moment they realize this is possible, all the infinite possibilities become solid realities in there, it's like infinite versions of multiverse. No wonder they can definitely fill any gap, any tear, any hole, any where. It's just another day that love saves the world.

Enjoy Cas's little physics class yet?

That class could use a curriculum textbook titled something like *"Theoretical Physics in Magic and Fantasy World"*.

Cas: You have no idea what I'm talking about since the first sentence, don't you?

Dean: No, but I love it when you talk abstruse, it turns me on. So, don't stop.

Instead of another lecture, he gets a kiss instead.

Or actually, more than just that.
