The theoretical explanations that Dean cuts off but Cas would have explained, if anyone is curious:

**Refraction**: Think of when you poke a finger into a glass of water and look from the side, the finger looks bended and twisted. It's caused by the different materials being different medium for the light, and they have different speeds of light, thus different wavelengths. It's the same when the angel's true form wavelength passes through the boundary between two dimensions: each dimension is a different media, with unique property and speed for wave to pass. The wavelength gets changed and twisted, that's why Cas's figure becomes stretched and enlarged to a deformed shape.

**Diffraction**: The quantum mechanics effect that if a microcosmic particle passes through a slit that as in the similar order of magnitudes with the particle size, the particle would diffract into uncertain location (*Uncertainty Principle*) with a mathematical distribution of likelihood where it may end up to. The smaller the slit, the larger range it could potentially end up with. The tear in the space is of similar size of Cas considering the wavelength, so Cas suffers from the Diffraction Effect, that's why he could potentially end up anywhere with no control of where he would land, only with a statistical likelihood to estimate.

**Infinity Mirror Effect**: If an item is positioned in between two perfectly aligned parallel mirrors, then there will be infinite reflections of the same item inside the mirrors. This is to explain why in the first two chapters, the cases are the strongest snow storm ever and the infinite number of vultures. The items that end up in between the dimension and get infinitely reflected are the most normal, natural things -- one snow flake, and one harmless vulture. But duplicate them by infinity (each of them identical), it would definitely become a disaster. For the story's purpose, also twisted them a little to make them extremely deadly.

**Wave-Matter Duality**: Angel's true form is a type of wavelength, the human vessel is a physical matter, therefore according to classical physics, there can be some contradiction sometimes. But according to quantum physics, there is Wave-Matter Duality to unify them: every matter is a wave, only differs in the length of the wave and frequency of the matter. Therefore in a sense, the human body is also a wave with limited wavelength, that explains why angel can reside into the body and occupies and moves around in it. Also explains why Jimmy said having an angel inside is like flying with a comet -- the short wavelength of human matter has a difficult time catching up with long wavelength angels.

And if we do the reverse calculation, it would mean angel's size as a physical matter would be extremely small according to the long wavelength. That is why angel has to possess human to walk the Earth, otherwise they would simply be too small to be seen.

Taking all that into consideration, it means when Cas said his true form size is as big as the Chrysler Building, that would be referring to his wavelength. Now it's a calculation problem, a wave with a wavelength of about three hundred meters long, it means the frequency is 1MHz, that falls within the range of Medium Frequency (MF) for things like AM radio broadcastings, coast guards, no wonder he can tune in to police radio as well.

Using *de Broglie's equation*, to have this wavelength, it would mean a proton moving at a $10^{-9}$ m/s or an electron moving at $10^{-6}$ m/s. So if Cas doesn't occupy a body and manifest as a physical existence on the Earth, he would have to be extremely small or extremely slow. Angel or not, he's bounded by the rule of physics.
