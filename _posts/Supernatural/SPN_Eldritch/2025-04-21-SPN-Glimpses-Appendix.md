The theoretical explanations that Dean cuts off but Cas would have explained, if anyone is curious:

**Refraction**: Think of when you poke a finger into a glass of water and look from the side, the finger appears bent and twisted. It's caused by different materials acting as different mediums for light, and each has a distinct speed at which light travels, thus different wavelengths.

The same thing happens when an angel passes through the boundary between two dimensions in the true form of wavelength: each dimension is a unique medium with its own unique property and speed for wave to pass. The wavelength is naturally altered and distorted at the boundary, can be enlarged when passing from one direction and shrunk from the other. That's why Cas's figure appears stretched and enlarged into a deformed shape.

**Diffraction**: A quantum mechanical effect that occurs when a microscopic particle passes through a slit that is roughly in the similar order of magnitudes with the particle size, the particle would diffract into an uncertain location (*Uncertainty Principle*) following a mathematical distribution of likelihood of where it may end up. The smaller the slit, the wider range it could potentially end up. The tear in space is comparable in scale to Cas's wavelength form, so Cas is subject to the Diffraction Effect, that's why he could potentially end up anywhere with no control of where he would land exactly, only a statistical likelihood to estimate.

**Infinity Mirror Effect**: When an object is placed between two perfectly aligned parallel mirrors, there will be infinite reflections of the same object inside the mirrors. This is to explain the phenomena witnessed when a tear is opened into the in-between dimension, explains why the cases are the strongest snowstorm ever, an infinite number of vultures, and the wildest aurora borealis. The objects that happened to be trapped between the dimensions and get infinitely reflected are the most ordinary, natural things -- one snowflake, one harmless bird, one plasma particle. But duplicate them by infinity (each one identical), it would inevitably become catastrophic. For the story's purpose, the reflections are also slightly twisted to render the situations extremely deadly.

**Wave-Matter Duality**: An angel's true form is a type of wave, the human vessel is physical matter, therefore according to classical physics, they are fundamentally different forms and there is no unified framework to reconcile them. But in quantum physics, Wave-Matter Duality provides a bridge to unify them: every matter is a wave, all matter has wave properties, differing only in the length of the wave and frequency of the matter.

Therefore in a sense, the human body is also a wave with a very limited wavelength, which explains why an angel can reside in the body, occupy, and move around in it. Also explains why Jimmy described hosting an angel as like flying with a comet -- the short wavelength of human matter has a difficult time keeping up with long-wavelength angels.

It can also explain the compatibility issue between certain human vessels and angels, and the concept of a true vessel. There must be certain necessary requirements to determine whether a vessel and an angel can fit together, based on wavelength and frequency. It is easy to imagine the requirement being their frequencies must resonate. Certain exceptionally strong vessels like those from the Novak bloodlines and the Winchester bloodlines, they can host most angels, demons, archangels, even multiple at once, suggesting their vessel frequencies must be highly adaptable and capable of resonating with a wide range of celestial wavelengths. Then it can also be deduced that celestial entities that have shared one strong vessel together are more likely to be able to exchange most of their other compatible vessels, including their respective true vessels. A "true vessel" must be the vessel whose frequency resonates most strongly with the angel's frequency, therefore very rare and very difficult to find.

And if we reverse the calculation, it would imply angel's size as a physical matter would be extremely small given their long wavelength. That is why an angel has to possess a human to walk the Earth, otherwise they would simply be too small to perceive.

Taking all that into account, when Cas says his true form size is as big as the Chrysler Building, he's referring to his wavelength. Now it's a calculation problem, a wave with a wavelength of about three hundred meters, it means the frequency is about 1MHz, which falls within the range of Medium Frequency (MF), commonly used by AM radio broadcastings and coast guards. No wonder he can tune in to police radio as well.

Using *de Broglie wave equation*, to have this wavelength, it would be equivalent to a proton moving at 10<sup>-9</sup> m/s or an electron at 10<sup>-6</sup> m/s, because the wavelength is determined by the Planck Constant and momentum, which in turn depend on the mass and velocity. So if Cas doesn't occupy a body and manifest physically in his true form on Earth, he'd have to be either extremely small or moving extremely slowly. Angel or not, he's bound by the laws of physics.

**Mass-Energy Equivalence**: According to Einstein's famous equation E=mc<sup>2</sup>, mass can be converted into energy in equivalence, with multiplied vacuum speed of light squared. So when Cas's spliced gigantic body gets shrunk from the size of the Chrysler Building to Jimmy Novak's height, the mass (proportional to volume, thus scaling cubically with height) would result in the release of approximately 3.85*10<sup>25</sup> Joules of energy, which is about 600 millions times more powerful than the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful nuclear bomb ever detonated. You wouldn't want to have him anywhere near downtown area, so thankfully all the occurrences of the cases are in reasonably remote locations (mountaintop, deep in woods, near Arctic), and Alaska is so very ideal, second only to totally desolated deserts. Let's just say this much energy is enough to seal a hole and patch a tear in the dimensions.

**The dimension in between**: The "dimension in between" is not any *single* dimension, not a higher or lower dimension, not the fifth dimension or the tenth dimension. It's a conceptual plane where other dimensions are flattened, including the time and space dimension. It's like two and a half dimension, or three and a half, a mashup of all the in-between dimensions.

In there, all the worlds in all the time and all the space coexist, as if they are all happening simultaneously in the same place. That is why when Cas is in there, when he notices light conjured from Dean's longing, he has no way of telling when and where that signal comes from. Because it could be from any time, any where, Cas wouldn't be able to tell the difference. If he goes imprudently to every call of Dean's, he might tear one hole to find a 26-year-old Dean, another to a 40-year-old Dean. That is also why it is a very real fear that Dean worries "what if next time you show up it's 20 years later, then 50." This can happen very easily, if not the now-Dean yearns the hardest, enough to anchor him.

That is also why the infinite future can actually be used to fill the hole and close the dimension in between: the future and the past are equivalent in there. The moment they realize this is possible, all the infinite possibilities become solid realities, it's like infinite versions of the multiverse before collapsing. No wonder it is adequate to fill any gap, patch any tear, seal any hole, make up for any damage anywhere.

At the end of the day, all the physics is just there to supply an explanation for why love can fix the world-ending problem. It's just another day where love saves the world.

Enjoy Cas's little physics class yet?

That class could use a curriculum textbook titled something like *"Theoretical Physics in a World of Magic and Fantasy"*.

<hr>

Cas: You have no idea what I've been talking about since the first sentence, do you?

Dean: No, but I love it when you talk abstruse, it turns me on. So, don't stop.

Instead of another lecture, he gets a kiss.

Or actually, more than just that.
