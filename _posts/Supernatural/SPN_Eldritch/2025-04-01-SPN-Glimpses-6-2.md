Dean opens his eyes again. He is still alone on the cold roadside of Alaska, at the World's End, with no more road to go and a large clump of lifeless figure collapsed in front of him on the ground. But for once, he feels good. For once, he is not really alone -- maybe he never is.

The sensation of Cas's existence tugs slightly in his mind. Dean tucks him in, feeling oddly like hens tucking chickens under their wings. All the while the angel's body is still an enormous hill in front of him. Dean laughs at the humor of the scene. He hears Cas mumbles a small unhappiness at the back of his head.

And Dean has to restrains his smile a little. "Sorry buddy, no, not laughing at the body, I swear." He comforts the angel. "Just thinking how extremely like a black satire movie this is. Would make a master piece as art, instead of, you know, as life."

Cas chuckles softly.

Dean gets better used to the too brightened view now. He widens his eyes in curiosity. The view of the world is so abundant with colors and clarity that he has never known. And he realizes the glinting stars constantly shining in his view aren't really stars, that's air, for what air really is. The air is not transparent empty, instead, tiniest particles charged with electricity shooting around, bumping into each other, transferring the power and energy. That must be where all the low buzzing and humming noises come from, and the small prickling feeling on the skin as if touching the low charged power line.

"The whole Earth's electric and magnetic field is being affected by the tear this time." Cas explains in the backseat of his head. "Because of the infinite plasma. The aurora borealis is just the phenomenon."

Dean looks up at the sky. He knows what Cas means now. It looks nothing like what his human eyes witnessed before. Well, in a way, it might still be the same scenery, the mixed dazzling colors, the shapes that are like flowing curtains and snakes and flames sweeping across the sky. Except, there are so much more details fitting in the blanks.

Now he can see more than light, more than color, more than sky. He sees the world as it is, he sees plasma punching into the ionosphere, he sees electrons jumping in and out of the excited atoms, he sees oxygens glaring red and nitrogen beaming green. The particles dance in the sky, drawing colors like tails of dragon, wings of phoenix, eyes of thunderbird. The palette of the universe, so big and so small at the same time. A world that no human eyes witness, and now he is showered with its beauty and magnificence. Because he has an angel inside him.

He doesn't realize tears are streaming down his face until he hears Cas's low soothing sound: "I'm sorry, Dean. Is it too much? I can restrain the eyesight, and other sensations..."

"No, no." Dean breathes, wiping away his tears in a hurry. Tears that are not coming from sorrow, or grieve, or worry, or joy, or any emotion really. It's the body reacting to the view, being taken by the grandiosity, overwhelmed by the shared sensation with an angel.

The magic is broken for a minute by the move. He tears his eyes away from above, having the sunk feeling knowing that he may not see anything like this again in his life, not after Cas leaves him. He wants to remember this. Is this what Cas means when he said he can only taste molecules when he tries food? Because to angel's eyes and senses, the whole world is too generously and selfishly only showing its fundamentals all the time, as particles? The view, the sound, the taste, the touch. Everything as they fundamentally are, as their smallest components. The smallest, and sometimes the biggest. Knowing too much, and sometimes feeling too little.

And he hears Cas answering, quietly, a little sad. "Yes. Sometimes."

Though Dean didn't really ask the question.

<br>

He sees the world as it is. Then he sees Cas as he is. And he sees himself as he is.

His eyes land on Cas's body next. The giant body dressed with tower-size clothes that is most human yet furthest from human. The body looks slimmer without the wings, but it's still a mountainous presence.

"The vessel is made of atoms and electrons in the material plane." Dean remembers his words again, the theoretics that Cas tried to explain to him but he had to cut him off because he couldn't understand. And this time, now, he doesn't just understand it, he sees it now.

The hand of the vessel limps alongside the body, lying loosely on the middle of the road, fingers curved, as tall as houses. Dean walks to them. It takes a few minutes.

Everything is in so much details. Every grain on the skin, every line in the palm, every hair and scar. He sees a hand, then he sees flesh and blood and bone, at last he sees the atoms and electrons, vibrating and humming with energy as all particles do.

Dean presses his own palm on the edge of this giant palm of Cas's body, it feels like touching a wall. But they touch. And he finds them the same. The same particles that form everything in this universe, in all the bodies, in Dean's and Cas's vessel, in flesh and blood, in planets and dust. The things that are as old as stars, and as new as buds. In the material plane, they are the same. But Cas is not.

Cas is not physical, not really. Cas does not come from this dimension, but he chooses here, he comes here. He resides in a body, and he walks the Earth. And now, he is inside Dean. He drops the grand form, and he curls up in that small corner of Dean's brain. And he doesn't complain. He stands there, and he says, "Dean." As if it's the only place he'd rather be.

For the first time, Dean thinks, maybe this is for the first time, he finally starts to have a glimpse of understanding what it means to be an angel. A real angel in all their forms, from their views. Not just the vessel, not just a piece. Not just, a fragment of trench coat, a thread of blue tie, a flying feather, a floating eye, or a silvery slice of the ring -- the pieces he saw in the dimension in between, during the seance, the pieces giving him nightmares nights after nights. Oddly, Dean finds himself feeling a tiny little bit of appreciation for what that dimension shows him. As much nightmare as it gives him, he finally gets to understand, Cas is magnificent and giant and beautiful, beyond his imagination. For the first time.

Dean clenches his fingers, putting his weight on the hands, holding himself there. At that minute, he wants nothing more than to really hold that hand, hold Cas. So he turns back to inside his head.

Cas meets him in the manifestation of Bobby's place. Sunshine seeping through the window doesn't shift, time doesn't move here. The bright sunlight shines half of Cas's figure, dying his black hair golden brown.

And Dean reaches for his hands, squeezing, looking him in the eyes. And Dean says: "Never ever say you don't deserve."

And Cas swallows, and smiles, and nods slightly. His eyes shining. Just like any human.
