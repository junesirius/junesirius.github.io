Blinks of shallow lights flash by then disappear like comets. Clouds of lights expand and shrink like nebulas. Clusters of lights form and dissipate like constellations.

Castiel stands in the dimension in between, floating, as if he's in the deep space. Stars and sparkles, here and there. He views the crowds of lights from one cluster to another, checking their brightness, the warmth, the color. Guessing, wondering.

His eyes sad, but not devasted. Longing, but he stays where he stands. Just looking, always looking. Looking at the lights like looking at the way home but he cannot go. Staring, as if they are the eyes of the person he has profound bond with but he cannot follow. Standing still, like a stone sculpture of guardian angel which he once so deeply believed he was, he still wishes to believe.

One flicker of light from the distance starts brightening up quick, catching his attention.

Cas looks up from where he is, wondering what that time and space would be. The intensity keeps growing, the praying and the yearning behind must be aggregating, Cas starts worrying. Dean prays the hardest when he's in great danger.

Cas starts moving toward the light.

It only glows stronger as he approaches, as if it senses him and reacts frantically -- which can't possibly happen. The closer he gets, the clearer it shows. With its color, its shape, and all the emotions of the human behind that light of yearning.

The light is dazzling green now. The color of emerald, of deepest forest, of bottled absinthe. The color of Dean's pupils. All too familiar. Irresistible.

And then, the voice comes through, like a phone line with bad signal, the sound is cut, on and off, but it's Dean's for certain, mixed with a woman's magical chanting, forming a power of pull.

"Come to me." He hears Dean's prayer. Near begging. Like every night when they were in the Purgatory. Back then, he would say, "I'll find you" and "We'll go home together".

Castiel feels his heart clutching in the desperate desire to reply. He wants nothing more than tracing the source of the sound, going to him, seeing his smile, embracing him with arms around his back, tight, feeling the warmth and solid. But he can't. He can't.

He had leviathans on his tails back then. And now, the cracks when he crosses the border, it seems they always tears the space apart and keeps leaking dangers and evil into the world, with Dean at the forefront. He barely managed to protect him and stop the damage last two times, he doesn't know if he can do it again, or if he wants.

The thought of bringing monsters to him. The thought of his own very existence being close to Dean would bring him more danger is a torture near unbearable. But in the face of Dean's safety, everything else could wait. Everything bubbling and stretching and screaming inside his own chest, asking for his own mind's permission, could wait.

Castiel stops himself when he's a few steps away from that bright light. Listening to the voices, holding himself, forcing himself to not move ahead another step. Because if he does, he wouldn't be able to pause at the next step, or the next.

Dean's voice echoes in the dimension.

"Cas." He's calling.

Castiel closes his eyes.

Sinking into the voice. Forcing his body still. Breathing out long and shakily.

<br>

The blackness behind his eyelid is not pure black anymore, it seems. As the table and the candle lights shake harder, there are glitters of sparks shining inside the black curtain like summer night's fireflies, like splashed sparks after gunshot.

Dean stares at them hard, widening and squinting his eyes while his eyelids are still closed. He sees the lights moving, wondering if it's his own imagination or the candle lights somehow grow strong enough that it's burning through his eyelids.

Or, is it the mysterious psychic's dimension that Missouri said she could bring him with, where he should go ahead looking for Cas?

He feels light and heavy at the same time. His vision blurred and cleared. He's not sure if his eyes are open or closed anymore.

Dean glances down at himself. There is no body, nothing to control to navigate around the space, only the view ahead. Like a lazy-designed first person view video game.

All he can do is looking, and thinking.

So he thinks hard: "Cas." He focuses on the syllables, thinking how his own tongue and throat would produce the sound, delivering the name.

"Cas --"

"Cas!"

He repeats the name over and over, yelling in his mind like rescue team searching for a lost traveler in the deep wild mountains, wondering if there is any chance the seance could really work, that Cas is really here and can hear him.

The high-pitched voice he heard in Missouri's room earlier sounds muffled now, quieter, lower. Gradually, more human, more recognizable.

Until, he hears Cas's words.

"Dean." Cas is answering his call. But he can't pin his sound.

"Where are you?" Dean can't help glancing around. But the closer he looks, the more confusing he gets. His brain can't make sense of the shapes and figures his eyes received, light and shade shift like looking through kaleidoscope. He catches sight of a blue loose thread, a button, a feather, then something seemingly metal. Then an eye, floating, blinking, staring at him, not connected to a body.

What is this, space dumpster in some horror movie? *Interstellar* but B-rated version? Dean muses, more taken aback than dread.

"This is the dimension in between other dimensions." Cas answers him, his voice comes from all over, echoing in the space that doesn't seem to have a boundary.

Dean tries to move his eyes around, looking for him, but the view only makes his mind dizzy.

"Don't look back, please." Cas's voice turns into an anxious warning, coming from behind him. Dean doesn't have a body to turn around. He can't see him, but somehow, he thinks, he can sense that weight of existence looming over. Like the weight of wings are wrapped around him. And he knows instantly, it is Cas, right there behind him, just out of his view.

"You shouldn't come any closer, you shouldn't even come here at all, Dean." Cas's voice tired and uneasy, over the back of his head. "My form here can hurt you, just by existing in the same plane. I don't want to make the same mistake as the one with Pamela Barnes again."

Dean gives a silent sigh, has to settle with the voice-only facetime. "How are you, Cas?"

"Fine." Cas answers plainly.

Dean manages to deliver the expression of "raising his eyebrows" through the thought. *Of course.*

"You've been here the whole time? After the Purgatory?"

"Most of the times that I can remember, yes. I don't remember the times at the beginning when the portal tears my mind apart, along with everything else." Cas tells him, his voice stable, but Dean knows the undercurrents he heard from the voice isn't his imagination.

"I'm sorry." Dean finds the words coming through the mind easily.

"It's not your fault." Cas says quickly. "You wouldn't have known the portal would do that."

"How bad is it?"

Cas hesitates. Dean's nerves get tense, "Cas? You still there?"

"Yes." Cas answers from behind him, somewhere high.

"So? How bad?"

Cas sighs, sound resigned. "The portal only works to send pure humans out, so I think it tries to parse out the human part of me to throw out, and keep the rest behind. So my human body, the vessel, and my essence in the true form, they are shattered --"

Dean's breath hitches.

Cas continues, "Every sense of me are in pieces earlier, at the beginning, it's even more difficult than --" He pauses briefly there, as if trying to decide whether he wants to tell the whole story, then he's decided. "-- more difficult than the time when I took over Sam's madness, and had to rebuild everything in my mind."

"Cas..." Dean starts, but doesn't know what to say after that, doesn't know if there is any word existed in the world that could mean anything here, or could express the clutching, squeezing feeling that is growing in him.

"But it's already a lot better now, if it's any comfort." Cas makes his voice light, Dean only tastes bitter from the words.

The blue thread is from the tie, the button from the shirt, the feather from the wings, the eye from the body. The things he saw in this space earlier suddenly makes sense now.

Bits and pieces. All Cas's. All shattered. God knows how many more are not even visible.

"Cas," Dean grits his teeth, asking, slowly, "the human part and angel part... It's not just talking about the body and the wings, isn't it?"

The emotions and feelings and doubts, those are definitely things only human minds tend to produce. And then there must be some memories and knowledge only belongs to angel. Then separating them apart would mean...

"It is not." Cas says gloomily, "But it's okay --"

"No, it's not." Dean cuts his words off. "Cas, damn it, stop saying you're okay when you're not. But we're in this together, alright? I promised I'd get you home, so I will. Getting your ass out of Purgatory didn't turn out well, let's just fix whatever this shitty dimension's problem is, and get over it. But I can't help if I don't know where to start. Why don't you give me a 101 go-over on the multidimension thing, and we'll see how to fix the problem? What do you say, Angel?"

There is a sound of cloth and wings rustling behind him. Dean has a surge of urge to look around at Cas, looking him in the eyes to see him nod, even if it would burn his eyes out. And right then, he hears Cas murmuring "Okay". Dean breathes out, echoing a same, long, relieved "Okay".

Cas starts: "My true form is a multidimensional wavelength celestial being, not bound to the Earth, while my body is made of atomic vibration and electron cloud in the material plane. Think of it as the Wave-Particle Duality in the quantum physics you humans discovered a hundred years ago. I believe I'm currently suffering from the *Refraction and Diffraction Effect*. And the boundary of this dimension has *Infinity Mirror Effect* when it interacts with any other dimensions. There are wave functions to better explain --"

"Jesus, Cas, aim lower!" Dean rolls his eyes as if they are standing face to face talking in their usual forms. "I said 101, not top advanced high confidential science lecture. I dropped out of high school, for Christ sake. Any chance I can get that in English again?"

"Going through the human portal, it affects me in all forms. It tears me apart, splices my true form with the vessel, makes me stuck in the dimension in between the planes, deforms me to be giant."

Dean remembers the huge trench coat shape against the snow storm and the wings spreading so wide he can't see the edge taking over all the spaces in the redwoods. *Giant, no kidding. He hasn't got a single full-body shot at Cas ever since Purgatory.*

"What's dragging you away?" He remembers the openings in the mid-air, the edge like a wound of the space, a tear in a fabric; remembers Cas stepping towards it, towards the eye of the tornado where the deadliest things come through most fiercely; then his grace weaving into the tear, gone from the sight. Leaving Dean alone, shaking, with exhaustion and bitter.

"Law of physics?" Cas offers.

There is no visible deadbeat badass being in this space, now that they have been here, so long, talking. No other evil beings cutting them through, no one (hopefully) listening in. No one running the place except for the natural order. *Huh.*

The easiest and toughest rule to break, then.

"Cas," he steadies his spinning thought, asking the most important question, the only question echoing in his mind every day and night since Purgatory, since before that. "How can I get you back? The whole, complete, normal, you. Not bits and pieces of glimpses here and there."

Cas falls quiet. After a long while, his voice finally echoes on top of Dean's head again: "I don't know."

*Don't know if it's possible, if they can find a way, or don't know if he really wants to come back?* Dean decides not to ask.

He tells him, instead: "I'll think of something. We'll figure it out. We always do. Hang in there tight, Cas, I get you."
