Blinks of shallow light flash by, then disappear like comets. Clouds of light expand and shrink like nebulas. Clusters of light form and dissipate like constellations. Each one a burst signal, sent across all time and all space.

Castiel stands in the dimension in between -- floating, more like -- as if he's adrift in deep space. Stars and sparks, here and there. He scans the crowds of light from one cluster to another, gauging their brightness, their warmth, their color. Guessing. Wondering.

His eyes are sad, but not devastated. Longing, but he stays where he stands. Just watching. Always watching. Looking at the lights like looking at the way home but he cannot go. Staring, as if they are the eyes of the person he shares a profound bond with but he cannot follow. Standing still, like a stone sculpture of a guardian angel that he once so deeply believed he was, he still wishes to believe.

One flicker of light in the distance starts to brighten up quickly, drawing his attention.

Cas lifts his gaze, wondering what time and space that light belongs to. Its intensity keeps growing, the prayer and the yearning behind it aggregating stronger, ever more urgent. Cas gets worried. Dean prays the hardest when he's in greatest danger.

Cas starts moving toward the light.

It only flares stronger and brighter as he approaches, as if it senses him and reacts frantically. The closer he gets, the clearer it shows. With its color, its shape, and all the emotion of the human behind that light of yearning.

The light is dazzling green now. The color of emerald, of deepest forest, of bottled absinthe. The color of Dean's eyes. All too familiar. Irresistible.

The biggest, greenest eye, floating in the space. But nothing else. Formed by pure light.

And then, his voice comes through, like a broken phone line with bad signal, the sound is distorted, clipped, on and off, in and out, but it's undeniably Dean's, mixed with a woman's magical chanting, forming a power of magnetic pull.

"Come to me." He makes out Dean's words. Near begging. Like every night when they were in Purgatory. Back then, he used to say, "I'll find you" and "We'll go home together".

Castiel feels his heart tighten with the overwhelming desperate urge to answer. He wants nothing more than to follow the voice, to do as told, go to him, to see his smile, to embrace him with arms around his back, tight, to feel the warmth and strength. But he can't. He can't.

He had Leviathans on his tail back then. And now, the cracks when he crosses the border, it seems they always tear the space apart and keep leaking danger and evil into the world, with Dean at the forefront. He barely managed to protect him and stop the damage the last two times, he doesn't know if he can do it again, or if he should.

The thought of bringing monsters to Dean. The thought of his own very existence being close to Dean could put him in danger is a near-unbearable torment. But in the face of Dean's safety, everything else can wait. Everything bubbling and stretching and screaming inside his own chest, begging for his own mind's permission, can wait.

Castiel stops himself when he's a few steps away from that bright light. Listening to the voices, holding himself back, forcing himself to not move ahead another step. Because if he does, he wouldn't be able to stop at the next, or the next.

Dean's voice echoes in the dimension.

"Cas." He's calling.

Castiel closes his eyes.

Sinking into the voice. Forcing his body still. Breathing out, long and shaky.

<br>

The blackness behind his eyelids is not pure black anymore, it seems. As the table and the candle flames shake harder, there are glimmers of sparks shining within the black curtain like summer night's fireflies, like scattered sparks after a gunshot.

Dean stares at them hard, eyes widening and squinting though his lids remain closed. He sees the lights shifting, wondering if it's his imagination or if the candlelight has somehow grown strong enough to burn through his eyelids.

Or, is it the mysterious psychic dimension Missouri said she could bring him to, the one where he should go ahead looking for Cas?

He feels light and heavy at the same time. His vision blurs and clears. He's no longer sure if his eyes are open or closed anymore.

Dean glances down at himself. There is no body, nothing to control to navigate around the space, only the view ahead. Like a lazily designed first-person video game.

All he can do is look, and think.

So he thinks hard: "*Cas.*" He focuses on the syllables, imagining how his own tongue and throat would produce the sound, deliver the name.

"*Cas --*"

"*Cas!*"

He repeats the name over and over, shouting in his mind like a rescue team calling out to a lost traveler deep in the wilderness, wondering if there is any chance the seance could actually work, if Cas is really here and can hear him.

The high-pitched sound he heard back in Missouri's room earlier is muffled now, quieter, lower. Gradually, more human, more recognizable.

Until finally, he hears Cas's words.

"Dean." Cas is answering his call. But he can't pin his sound.

"Where are you?" Dean can't help glancing around. But the closer he looks, the more confused he gets. His brain can't make sense of the shapes and figures his eyes receive, light and shade shifting like a kaleidoscope. He catches a glimpse of a loose blue thread, a button, a feather, then something glittering metallic. Then an eye, floating, blinking, staring at him, not connected to a body. Blue.

What is this, a space dumpster from some horror movie? *Interstellar* but B-rated version? Dean muses, more taken aback than dread.

"This is the dimension in between other dimensions," Cas answers him, his voice coming from all directions, echoing in a space that doesn't seem to have a boundary.

Dean tries to move his eyes around, looking for him, but the view only makes his mind reel.

"Don't look back. Please," Cas's voice turns into an anxious warning, coming from behind him. Dean doesn't have a body to turn around. He can't see him, but somehow, he thinks -- he feels, he can sense that weight of presence beyond his vision, looming over. Like the brush of wings wrapping around him. And he knows instantly, with one hundred percent certainty, it is Cas, right there behind him, just out of his view.

"You shouldn't come any closer. You shouldn't have even come here at all, Dean." Cas's voice tired and uneasy, drifting over the back of his head. "My form here can hurt you, just by existing in the same plane. I don't want to make the same mistake I did with Pamela Barnes again."

Dean gives a silent sigh, resigned to settle with voice-only FaceTime. "How are you, Cas?"

"Fine," Cas replies flatly.

Dean manages to convey a mental eyebrow raise. *Of course.*

"You've been here the whole time? After Purgatory?"

"Most of the times I can remember, yes. I don't remember the earliest times at the beginning when the portal tore my mind apart, along with everything else." Cas tells him, his voice stable, but Dean knows the undercurrent he heard from the voice isn't his imagination.

"I'm sorry." Dean finds the words coming through the mind easily.

"It's not your fault," Cas says quickly. "You couldn't have known the portal would do that."

"How bad is it?"

Cas hesitates. The silence stretches, Dean's nerves go tense. "Cas? You still there?"

"Yes." Cas answers from behind him, somewhere high.

"So? How bad?"

Cas sighs, the sound resigned. "The portal only works on pure humans, so I think it tried to parse out the human part of me to throw out, and keep the rest behind. So my human body, the vessel, and my essence in the true form, they were shattered --"

Dean's breath hitches.

Cas continues, "Every sense of me was in pieces earlier, at the beginning, it was even more difficult than --" He pauses briefly there, as if debating whether he wants to tell the whole story, then he's decided. "-- more difficult than when I took over the broken pieces from Sam's mind, and had to rebuild everything in my head."

"Cas..." Dean starts, but doesn't know what to say after that, doesn't know if there is any word existed in the world that could mean anything here, or could express the tight, gut-wrenching feeling rising inside him.

"But it's already a lot better now, if it's any comfort." Cas makes his voice light, Dean only tastes bitterness in the words.

The blue thread is from the tie, the button from the shirt, the feather from the wings, the eye from the body. The things he saw in this space earlier suddenly make sense now.

Bits and pieces. All Cas's. All shattered. God knows how many more are not even visible.

"Cas," Dean grits his teeth, asking, slowly, "the human part and angel part... it's not just about the body and the wings, is it?"

The emotions and the feelings and the doubts, those are definitely things human minds tend to produce. And then there must be some memories and knowledge only belongs to the angel part. Then separating them apart would mean...

"It is not," Cas says gloomily, "But it's okay --"

"No, it's not." Dean cuts his words off. "Cas, damn it, stop saying you're okay when you're not. We're in this together, alright? I promised I'd get you home, so I will. Getting your ass out of Purgatory didn't go as planned -- fine. Let's just fix whatever this shitty dimension's problem is, and get over it. But I can't help if I don't know where to start. So why don't you give me a 101 go-over on the multidimension thing, and we'll see how to fix the problem? What do you say, Angel?"

There is a sound of cloth and wings rustling behind him. Dean feels a surge of urge to turn around, to look at him in the eyes and see him nod, even if it would burn his own eyes out. And right then, he hears Cas murmur, "Okay." Dean breathes out, echoing the same, long, relieved, "Okay."

Cas starts: "My true form is a multidimensional wavelength celestial being, not bound to Earth, while my body is composed of atomic vibrations and electron clouds in the material plane. Think of it as the *Wave-Particle Duality* in the quantum physics your species discovered a century ago. I believe I'm currently suffering from the *Refraction and Diffraction Effect*. And the boundary of this liminal dimension has an *Infinity Mirror Effect* when it interacts with any other dimensions. There are wave functions to explain more precisely --"

"Jesus, Cas, aim lower!" Dean rolls his eyes like they are standing face to face talking in their usual forms. "I said 101, not top-secret advanced science lecture. I dropped out of high school, for Christ's sake. Any chance I can get that in English again?"

"Going through that portal affected me in all forms. It tore me apart, sending me into the dimension between planes." Cas sighs in frustration. "I have tried to put myself back together, but this dimension throttles the effort, splicing my true form with the vessel, deforming me into something misshaped and giant."

Dean winces, remembering the huge trench coat shape against the snowstorm and the wings spread so wide he couldn't see the edges, taking over all the space between the redwoods. *Giant, no kidding. He hasn't gotten a single full-body shot of Cas ever since Purgatory.*

"What's dragging you away?" He remembers the openings mid-air, edges like wounds in space; remembers Cas stepping toward them, toward the eye of the tornado where the deadliest things came through most fiercely; then his grace weaving into the tear, gone from sight. Leaving Dean alone, shaking, with nothing but exhaustion and bitterness.

"Law of physics?" Cas offers.

There is no visible deadbeat badass entity in this space, not while they have been here talking for so long. No evil beings cutting them off, no one (hopefully) eavesdropping. No one running the place except the natural order. *Huh.*

*The easiest and toughest rule to break, then.*

"Cas," Dean steadies his spiraling thoughts, asking the most important question, the only question that's echoed in his mind every day and night since Purgatory, since before that. "How can I get you back? The whole, complete, normal, you. Not bits and pieces, not glimpses here and there." *Not broken, not crazy, not amnesia. Just, Cas.*

Cas falls quiet. After a long pause, his voice finally echoes on top of Dean's head again: "I don't know."

*Don't know if it's possible, if they can find a way, or don't know if he really wants to come back?* Dean decides not to ask.

He tells him this, instead: "I'll think of something. We'll figure it out. We always do. Hang in there tight, Cas. I got you."
