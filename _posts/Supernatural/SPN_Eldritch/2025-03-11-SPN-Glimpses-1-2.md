There are still work to do. There are always work, somewhere. Monsters, ghosts, something dark, something evil, something hiding in the dark and tearing people's heart out or drinking their blood dry.

Dean is good at finding things in the dark. But this time, he's looking for something in the light. Something bright and glaring, fluffy and feathery, something holy and angelic.

As much as he would say angels are nothing more than monsters with good PR, as many times as Cas has explained he doesn't have a harp, it seems when he thinks of Cas, he thinks of halo and wings. So that's what he looks for.

Dean gets into the habit of picking up a piece of newspaper at the breakfast and reading through. Then he sits in the cafe for a whole day going through people's mention of angelic encounters. He scans and scrolls, reads and looks, squints at the words of the witnesses and illustrations from the visionaries, thinking, if any of these is a sign of Cas. If any of them can be luckier than he is, and has a glimpse of Cas while he cannot.

Then he drives, and reads, and asks people around if there is anything weirdly holy happening, and orders the paper and cafe. Then he hits the road again.

The days and roads muffled together. Dean distantly realizes he might get as bearded and dirty as he was in Purgatory, and he decides he doesn't care. He punches the word "angel" into the laptop searching bar again.

<br>

There are some pagan gods in Wyoming, some werewolves in Michigan, and then some more pagan gods in Colorado. Dean takes care of them.

He has hoped maybe some of those pagan gods could have enough juice that he can negotiate to use. But at the end of the day, none of them are anything more than a bunch of bloodthirsty son of bitches. Dean buries the knives into their chests or cuts their heads off, whatever works.

Blood of the gods and creatures splatter onto his face. Dean gets so used to it now he doesn't flinch or blink.

Some of these days, the Earth feels no different from the Purgatory. Full of ugly things, and none of the one he's looking for.

He still prays every night. And he drives on.

By November, he has cleaned a nest of vampires in Oregon and kills a nasty spectre in Missouri. The winter is falling onto him quickly. But the coldness is the last thing he would worry.

The first snow catches him when he's in Rocky Mountain, Colorado, thinking of cutting the state in a short cut, when the blizzard almost buries half the car. He stays in a tourist center on the waist of the mountain, stuck with a group of tourists too stupid to travel without checking weather report, staring at the roaring snow outside of the window painting the whole world white and blank. Separated from the rest of the world.

There is no snow in the Purgatory. Or rain. Or sun.

Everything is just grey and bleak, trees half-dead with only trunks standing, ground covered by dirt of corroded skeletons.

So at least, if nothing else, the snow is a good reminder that this is really the Earth. Dean watches the strong wind blowing snowflakes as large as his palm onto the window, then adding layers after layers. The view soon blocked by the thick cover of snow and ice.

"No, I'm telling you, it's true, there are yetis in this mountain. Legends say they only come out in storms like this, feeding on lost hikers. The snow hides their traces too well so they are super difficult to track, but we still manage to take the photos." Some remote chatter reaches his ear. Dean focuses on the bitter coffee in his hands, trying to block out any mention of new monster or legends. He isn't really in a hunting mood right now. Coldness seeps in from the gaps of the windows.

He hears laughter from the crowd, whatever photo that man is showing around, the rest of the group isn't buying. A young woman's mocking voice is loud enough for him to hear from across the lobby:"This can't possibly be a bigfoot trace, Hector. What do you take us for, idiots? Look at the print, it's not even barefoot, might as well be a size-hundred dress shoe. Unless you're saying yetis start wearing suits and dress shoes?" The crowd bursts into laughter.

Dean lowers his head and takes another drink of his coffee that's already getting cold. Cas used to wear dress shoe. It's been a long while seeing him in the suits though, with everything so messed up and he ended up in a hospital gown that even got carried over into the other side of the portal, Dean finds himself missing that suit and funny little reversed tie.

He doesn't realize a tiny little curl starts pulling on the tip of his lips.

It's been too long. The last time they were both themselves, it's like years and years ago. Feels like decades even. Before the Purgatory, before the broken Sam, before the Leviathans, or Raphael. Long, long, time ago when he can still straight his ties, and tells Cas he's "also an FBI", only to watch the name ID got displayed upside down.

God, how he wished this is still then.

His lips drop entirely. He drinks another sip of the coffee. It's completely cold now.

"If you don't believe the photo, I guess you won't believe what I saw by my own eyes, then." The man that must is Hector insists, voice over the lingering chuckles that haven't died down. "I swear to God, on the day I take the photo, I see a yeti that is so much larger than any in the record. It must be at least sixty feet tall, and the most weird thing is its color. Not like any other white yetis, this one has a beige color, and the back standing so straight, if I don't know any better, I might say it's a giant in a trench coat."

Dean jerks up his head so fast he even startles himself. He jumps to his feet, grabbing the man by the collar before he even realizes what he's doing. "What did you say?" He scowls right into the man's face.

Hector stutters. "Chill, man. Just some story time. I was telling the ladies the other night when I was on the mountain. Just so happened to see this weird ass yeti."

"The trench coat, what's it like?" Dean shakes his collar, the man is practically raised to his toes like a cat picked up by the neck.

"Are you crazy? I don't know, just a trench coat. I mean, it's probably nothing, lights and reflections or something." Hector protests and pushes at his shoulder.

Dean lets him go. "And you say he's on top of the mountain in a snow storm like this one?"

"*He*?" Hector flattens his wrinkled clothes, laughing, "Yeah, sure, on the highest top, surrounding a big pile of fire with cooked human meat, dancing with other female yetis!" The group of tourists burst into a huge outburst of laughter.

Dean turns around, walking straight towards the door.

"Sir, it's too dangerous to go outside in this weather." One of the workers of the place calls after him.

Dean doesn't look back. "I'm going." He says.
