Lights brighten in Castiel's eyes immediately in Dean's chanting, then in his mouth. Then in every single eye spread across the three spinning rings.

The lights are so blinding that the sun would be ashamed of its dimness in comparison. Dean doesn't want to close his eyes, not this time. *If it burns, then let it burn,* he decides.

He keeps looking at Castiel, at his body that is too enormous, at his face too high above in mid-air, at the wings spread wide and casting long shadows, at the rings spinning like stars in orbit and reflecting silvery. Dean looks at Castiel as he is, in all the forms that he is, as a whole. He takes everything that is Castiel all in as if those are going to be the last things his eyes might ever see again -- which could very well be true. He needs to see him to time the next part right. But more importantly, he needs to see him.

The lights begin to cover the wings, then the rings shimmer just as brightly, as if these angelic parts all start melting together into grace.

Slowly and steadily, Castiel's grace is expelled from his body by the incantation, as the spell works its magic. The flowing lights shift through the air, swirling as if they have lives of their own, twisting and floating, like solar winds flowing in space, like the dazzling shape of aurora lights undulating on the firmament. They circle around Cas's body, hesitant to leave. Then they begin rising, moving skyward, toward Heaven.

Dean is already moving toward the Impala as he chants the angel exorcism, by the time the last thread of Cas's grace leaves his body, he already has the car trunk wide open, and the bowl with the mixture of ingredients for the angel summoning spell setting on the drawing is long pre-prepared and ready to go. He throws a lit match into the bowl, watching the flames leap high from the mix of herbs.

Outside, Cas's grace begins to move back, descending from the sky, as the ritual takes effect.

Dean holds his breath and waits. A part of his brain never stops wandering off, panicking about what if the summoning doesn't work and Cas's grace ends up at the Heaven's gates, where other angels spot him and kill him again. He doesn't realize he starts praying again, just repeatedly thinking, *Please, Cas. Please, work. Please, come back.*

As Cas's grace flies away and then hovers back, his body collapses like a falling mountain. Without the control of a living mind, the body drops, the legs slump, the arms limp, the shoulders crash. The ground shakes like an earthquake. The sound of mountains moving, oceans churning, volcanos erupting.

Dean is startled, he is petrified. He only belatedly realizes he forgot to consider how to prevent this giant body from crashing to the ground hard, from being harmed by the impact of the collision. Though, given his own tiny size, he doubts there is anything he could have done. He hates the thought that Cas's body might be injured in the process by the slightest because of his oversight. *Please.* He can only hope.

The only fortunate thing is that this is Alaska. For miles, there are no human sightings. No one to witness anything, no collateral damage.

Dean runs toward where the giant body lies. Where the Chrysler Tower has fallen to the earth. The site of the landfall and avalanche of one single celestial being, of Castiel.

There is something else he realizes not working as he thought should be. The body is still too big -- as it was. Somehow in his mind, in his plan, he imagined it would shrink back to the normal size the moment the angelic parts were separated, somehow things would correct themselves and problems would get solved automatically -- they never do.

And now, with the grace hovering over the lifeless body that is still too giant, the problem remains.

Dean forces himself to think fast. He looks at the cloud of light, as if looking into Cas's eyes. He can feel his own brain overheating from thinking too hard, dizzy from the brilliance, too sluggish to keep up with reality.

"Okay, umm, okay, we just need to, ugh --" Dean puts a hand on the edge of the giant trench coat that now spread across the ground. And as far as he reaches, he can only lay a palm on the corner, no farther than the first stitched edge. *He's too tiny, too weak, too helpless.* The shape and scale keep reminding him. *He's just a human. How could he ever imagine fixing an angel that is so grand and beautiful?*

Dean clenches his fingers around that corner of the fabric he can get, forcing his mind away from that train of thought. *This is about Cas, not about him.*

The lights float closer to him than to the body on the ground, but still high in the air, out of reach.

Dean feels like he can almost imagine Castiel's frown and tilted head in the way the grace hovers around him. Paused, pending, nowhere to go. Homeless. Bodyless.

"We need to get you a body first."

The thought comes in a flash, so does the answer. This is actually an obvious answer. An easy one, too easy. A permission freely given.

"Yes," Dean says quickly, eyes seeking the light of Cas's grace. "Cas, I said yes."

The grace floats toward him, circling around his body, inches away, but doesn't move into him like he expects it to be. It's almost like Cas is considering, hesitating, resisting.

"You'll never hurt me, I promise," Dean looks at the grace, knowing what he must be thinking. "I trust you." He reaches out a hand, and touches the grace, finding it warm and soft, like the brush of a feather.

The light reacts to his touch instantly, curling around his fingers, then gliding along his skin up the arm until it reaches his mouth. It swarms into him.

The sensation of being possessed isn't exactly welcoming. It feels like an intrusion no matter what, a forest fire burning its way down his throat, an explosion of light and thunder ripping through his veins, lava pouring and spreading through his chest. His body panics automatically, muscles tense. His body tries to reject the outsider even if his brain commands otherwise. Dean forces his mind to focus on the only thought he can hold on to: *This is Cas. This is Cas. This is Cas.* And his heartbeat slowly calms.

The view of the world flares bright once all the grace infuses into him, it's like setting the brightness and contrast level on a TV screen to a thousand and more. Everything so dazzling and blinding, covered by glinting stars, Dean thinks his eyes might burn out from looking at the world like this even a minute longer, but then realizes the eyes are perfectly adapted to it -- the eyes that are not entirely his own right now. *Is this the view of the world in Cas's eyes?*

"Cas?" Dean's mouth whispers, tentatively, toward the empty road ahead of him. Cas's body is still slack on the ground, but that's not what he means.

Inside him, the stir of another presence emerges. Dean closes his eyes, searching inward.

At the edge of his mind, he finds him. Cas looks exactly the same as he remembers him, the trench coat, the blue tie, the disheveled hair, the bright blue eyes. No rings though, and no wings. Human-like. Familiar. Comfortable and easy to look at.

Cas stands there, still and quiet, in the corner of Dean's mind, as if trying to take up as little space as possible, like a shy kid hiding at the back of the prom, trying to make himself unnoticeable.

This corner of Dean's mind looks like Bobby's old living room back when it was still standing. The place closest to home. And Cas is here.

Dean rushes to him. "There you are."

For all his concerns, Cas looks well. In this current form as he is -- whatever it's called when he is just a cloud of light inside Dean's mind. He looks a little tired, and a little -- no, a lot -- worried, with the deep furrow between his brows. But all things considered, he looks fine. No wounds, no scars, no cuts, no twisting or distortion. Not like in any of the dreams or nightmares Dean has been having. He looks okay, and normal. And utterly human.

Dean spreads his arms and pulls Cas into a hug. His brain produces the sensation of warmth and solidity of a body for him, even though he knows nothing is physical now.

Cas reluctantly lifts his arms and wraps them around Dean. The motion alien and hesitant like he's not used to having arms again. Then he doesn't let go. Neither does Dean.

"Hello, Dean," He says, in his gravelly voice.

Dean exhales a happy huff, realizing he can't even begin to tell him how much he's missed this voice, among everything else.

"Hey, Cas," He replies, over his shoulder.

They separate, after a long, long time, each taking half a step back, still standing too close, eyes still holding. In this corner of Dean's mind, in this memory or dream or whatever it is, sunshine filters through the window, casting long lazy shadows across the soft fuzzy carpet of the living room floor. Dean can almost pretend it's just a comfortable quiet afternoon on a lazy normal day. Everything warm and hazy. They could curl up on the couch and watch TV for hours, take a small nap if they doze off. And Bobby or Sam would call them for dinner.

Dean smiles.

But Cas's frown does not unwind.

"You shouldn't have done this," Cas says, his eyes close to reproachful, but it really just is all condensed concern. And Dean knows.

"Yeah, heard that before, kinda have a name for terrible at doing what I should do by now, ain't I?" Dean grins. The kind of grin that makes a shallow dimple appear on his cheek.

Cas sighs, and says, quietly, wholeheartedly. "Thank you."

Dean answers with a nod and a smile. "Don't mention it."

He pats Cas on the shoulder. The touch is still warm and solid. Real.
