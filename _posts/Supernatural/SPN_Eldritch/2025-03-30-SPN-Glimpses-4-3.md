Dean goes back to Kermit, Texas.

The weather is warming up everywhere, even more so in Texas. April here is almost like summer in the Midwest.

He hides the car two blocks away, and stands behind a tree across the street. The bushes and lawn inside the fence are tidy, freshly cleaned. The blossoms poking out between the pickets are soft and pink.

The white curtains are drawn. But as he watches, the same woman he saw last time walks slowly to the window, opening the curtain and the window half-wide, stretching lazily. The early sunlight dyes her light brown hair a warm chestnut. Her hand absently rubs her lower stomach.

Dean finds it surprisingly easy to imagine dark brown hair on a future niece or nephew.

He hears Sam's voice before seeing him, the jingle of a dog's neck bell rings cheerfully accompanying his voice.

"Dog, Dog! This way!"

Dean looks up, watching as Sam rounds the corner of the block, in his morning jog clothes, running down the street. A big shepherd dog trots a few steps ahead of him.

They stop in front of the house. The door opens before Sam reaches the top step of the stairs.

"I can hear you from a block away." The woman smiles fondly, leaning on the doorframe. "All the neighbors probably know by now our dog is called 'Dog.'"

Sam laughs, genuinely happy. Even from across the street, even with his back to him, Dean can see his smile. He lights up with his whole body, like a river thawing under the touch of sunshine.

"You want to name him something else?" he hears Sam answer, then sees him reaching out to the woman, holding her waist, pulling her into a hug and a light kiss, as if they haven't seen each other for a year, instead of less than a morning.

The woman wraps her arms around Sam's back, holding him close. Dean can see her hands gripping the back of his flannel, her ring finger reflecting a silvery light. She must have whispered something funny near Sam's ear, Sam barks out louder laughter again. They finally walk into the house after that.

The clean, painted door closes behind them.

Dean stares at the closed door for a moment longer, with a small smile tugging at his lips.

There is a large iron lock on the garage door, in addition to last time. A printout is taped at eye level, too far for Dean to read, but sure enough, there is an image of the Impala.

Dean wonders briefly what Sam did when he found out the Impala was missing. Did he check the security footage and traffic cameras like they would for a case? Or did he just call the police station and post flyers in the neighborhood, like a *normal* person with a lost pet?

He wonders, then decides, it doesn't matter.

Dean looks at the house one last time, pressing his forehead to the tree trunk he hides behind. He whispers a quiet, "Goodbye, Sammy." And walks down the street to where he left the car.

<br>

Battle Creek, Michigan is another quick stop.

Dean knows he shouldn't come here, but he can't help it.

It's just another early morning for another town. Twenty hours and three coffees later, he is outside another white-fence house, peeking from inside the car.

Lisa is bustling around the kitchen; Ben has a plate of pancakes. A decent-looking man sits by the same table, looking at both of them with a genuine smile. Lisa tells him "Take care" three times before the kid waves dramatically and walks down the street. A school bus pulls up at the corner five minutes later and picks him up.

Dean is already on his way to Sioux Falls, South Dakota when the light turns green for that school bus at the next block.

Bobby's place is just as he left it, burnt to the ground. And Jody is busy inside the sheriff's office.

Dean watches her from the car.

No one inside that place notices he has been there.

No one in the world notices he has been anywhere, or he would be gone to nowhere.

But it's okay.

Dean stuffs his hands into his jacket pockets, sniffing quietly. He says to himself, "Okay, I'm ready."

That is when his fingers brush against a piece of paper in the pocket.

He fishes it out. The scrap is torn in a hurry from some old newspaper, with scratchy handwriting along the blank edge reads: "Try Alaska. World's End. Thinnest veil. Go get my unicorn."

Dean huffs a short laugh, remembering Meg's last almost-pat. He mutters, "Son of a bitch," with a small smile.

<br>

There is a certain level of truth to calling Alaska the "World's End."

Dean can see it now as he drives farther north.

For miles after miles, the pines lining the road are the only living things he can see. The sky overhead remains dark for long hours even during the day.

He doesn't stop until he reaches the city named Barrow. Until there is no more road ahead of him. There is only the ocean, the glacier, the Arctic left.

For all his life, for all his driving, Dean never thought there would be a day where there is no more road for him to drive. Where, he would reach the end of the path, the end of the Earth, and the near end of himself. Everything fits together so poetically.

He parks the Impala by the empty road, beneath a pine tree, and gets out of the car.

The sky is night, though his watch says otherwise. The twinkling stars in the black canopy blink brightly, more crowded than anywhere else he's seen.

Dean stands on the road, looking up, eyes closed, lips quivering. *Cas.*

The air is chilly, as cold as Alaska is supposed to be, but not any colder. His breath forms thin white fog. The surrounding is quiet, so quiet that he can hear nothing but his own heartbeat pounding heavily in his chest. *Cas.*

He reaches into the innermost chest pocket. The cloth and feather are still there. He holds them, as if the mere touch of them can give him the strength and hope that is losing fast. *Cas.*

There is a pistol on the right side of his belt, and the demon blade on the left. *Death is the infinite vessel.* Dean finds himself wondering, which would be the easier way to go.

There is a whizzing sound rising on the horizon, moving swiftly through the sky. The sound is no louder than the crackle of static electrical sparks on clothes in dry autumn days.

Dean opens his eyes.

There in the sky, astonishing colors and lights are forming and shifting. Bright and abundant in color, the lights are like moving clouds, flicking across the dark curtain of the sky. In fact, the lights are like curtains themselves. Dazzling green lights stretch into vertical lines, as low as the ground, as high as outer space. The green curtain sweeps across the sky, leaving a lighter amber-green trail in its wake.

Dean has never seen the aurora borealis before. He stares, transfixed by the breathtaking scene on the sky without blinking, wondering if it's something natural or there is a tear somewhere nearby. Wondering, if Cas is going to show up any time under this astonishingly beautiful sky.

The crackling sound grows louder, more like the snapping of a fire burning in the hearth now. And the bright aurora lights shift faster, moving across the sky as though alive. The vertical curtain of lights extends farther and longer, then twists into shorter curves and circles, sliding away like snakes wriggling. The green deepens, shifting from the color of mint to lime and emerald.

Dean hovers his hand over the weapons on his belt, fingers edging on the handles but not closing on them. Waiting. He watches the vast sky, feeling small again. The infinity of color and light.

More colors emerge, soon. There is so much more than green. The globe of the sky transforms into an immense palette of color and light; the electrical sound fills the air, buzzing with electricity power as the moving lights intensify. Red aurora lights start to show on top of the other colors, floating and shimmering, closely followed by a share of dazzling blue. Like flowing fire sweeping across the vault of sky.

Dean doesn't realize his cheek is wet until a tear drops from his jaw. The grandeur takes his breath away. The thought and prayer finally crawl their way out of his throat. The silent plea becomes a low murmur, and Dean is saying: "Cas. Please. Come to me."

The crackling in the air turns into louder sputtering, as if every particle in the air has been charged with electricity, and every movement of wind sends a current through it. Dean feels his skin prickle with the static. He wonders how long it would take, for all the air from earth to sky to be so charged, that the smallest motion could turn a friction into a spark, just like in a gas station but millions of times stronger, and the air and sky would turn into a literal sea of flame, devouring any men in between.

But he can fix this. Fix the world. Save Cas. His mission, his only job.

Dean wraps the fingers around the demon blade, raising it in front of him. The tip close to the chest, not touching yet.

The air before him shudders violently. Dean holds his breath, watching it tear open from the other side, becoming a large black scar hanging vertically in midair.

A figure manifests slowly from the tear. The disheveled hair is the first to emerge, showing up at a thousand feet height on the top. Followed closely by a towering giant human-shaped body, cloaked in an enormous trench coat, standing steadily on the ground. Behind the body stretch three pairs of colossal wings, spread high and wide, leaving long dark shadows beneath the bright aurora lights, holding very still. And above it all, the strangest thing ever, Dean finds himself being watched by countless eyes all at once, spread on three gigantic spinning rings.

Dean forgets how to breathe.
