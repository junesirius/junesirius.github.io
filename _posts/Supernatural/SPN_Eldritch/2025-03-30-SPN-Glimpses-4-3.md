Dean goes back to Kermit, Texas.

The weather is turning warm everywhere, even more so in Texas. April here is almost like summer in Midwest.

He hides the car two blocks away, and stands behind the tree across the street. The bushes and lawn inside the fence are neat, newly cleaned. The blossoms poking out between the pickets are pink.

The white curtains are closed. But as he watches, the same woman he saw last time walks lazily to the window, opening the curtain and the window half-wide, yearning lazily. The early sunlight dyes her light brown hair a chestnut color. Her hand rubs her lower stomach half-heartedly.

Dean finds it very easy to imagine the dark brown hair color for a future niece or nephew.

He hears Sam's voice before seeing him, the sound of a dog's neck bell rings cheerfully alongside his voice.

"Dog, Dog! This way!"

Dean looks up, watching Sam turns around the corner of the block, in his morning jogging clothes, running down the street. A big shepherd dog runs a few steps in front of him.

They stop in front of the house. The door is open before he reaches the top level of the stairs.

"I can hear you from a block away." The woman smiles fondly, leaning on the door frame. "All the neighbors probably know by now our dog is called 'Dog'."

Sam laughs, genuinely happy. Even from across the street, even as he stands back to him, Dean can see his smile. He brightens up with his whole body like a river thawing under the touch of sunshine.

"You want to name him something else?" he hears Sam answer, then sees him reaching out to the woman, holding her waist, pulling her into a hug and a light kiss, as if they haven't seen each other for a year, instead of less than a morning.

The woman wraps her arms around Sam's back, holding him there. Dean can see her hands clenching at Sam's flannel as she holds him. She must have murmured something funny by Sam's ear, Sam barks out a louder laughter again. They finally walk into the house after that.

The clean painted door closes behind them.

Dean looks at the closed door for a moment longer, with a small smile of his own.

There is a large iron lock on the garage door, addition to last time. A printout is stuck on the eye level, too far away for Dean to tell what is written on there, but sure enough, there is an image of the impala.

Dean wonders briefly what Sam did with it once he found out impala was missing. Did he check the security footage and traffic cameras like they would do as if it's a case? Or did he just call the police station and stick some printouts in the neighborhood like when normal people have a lost pet?

He wonders, then decides, it doesn't matter.

Dean looks at the house one last time, pressing his forehead to the tree trunk that he hides behind. He whispers a quiet "Goodbye, Sammy." And walks down the street to where he hid the car.

<br>

Battle Creek, Michigan is another quick stop.

Dean knows he shouldn't come here, but he can't help it.

It's just another early morning for another town. Twenty hours and three coffees later, he is outside of another white-fence house, peeking from inside the car.

Lisa is busy around the kitchen, Ben has a plate of pancake. Lisa tells him "Take care" three times before the kid waves dramatically and walks down the street. A school bus parks at the corner five minutes later and picks him up.

And Dean is on his way to Sioux Falls, South Dakota when the red light turns green for that school bus in the next block.

Bobby's place remains the same as the last time he saw it, burnt to the ground. And Jody is busy around inside the sheriff's office.

Dean watches her from the car.

No one inside that place notices he has come here.

No one in the world notices he has come anywhere, or he would be gone to nowhere.

But it's okay.

Dean pokes his hands into the jacket pockets, sniffing his nose. He says to himself: "Okay, I'm ready."

That is when his fingers feel a piece of paper inside the pocket.

He fishes it out. The paper is torn in a hurry from some old newspaper, the scratchy handwriting at the blank edge reads: "Try Alaska, World's End, thinnest veil. Go get my unicorn."

Dean huffs a short laughter, remembering Meg's last almost-pat. He says, "Son of a bitch." With a small smile.

<br>

There is a certain level of truth to call Alaska the "World's End".

Dean can see it now as he drives further north.

For miles after miles, the pines along the road are the only living things he can see. The sky overhead remains dark for long hours even in the day time.

He doesn't stop until he reaches the city named Barrow. Until there is no more road ahead of him. There is only the ocean, the glacier, the Arctic left.

For all his life, for all his driving, Dean never thinks there will be a day where there is no more road for him to drive. Where, he will reach the end of the path, the end of the Earth, and the near end of himself. Everything fits together so poetically.

He parks the impala by the empty road, underneath a pine tree, and gets off the car.

The sky is showing the night time, though the watch says otherwise. The stars sparkle in the black firmament, blinking brightly, more crowded than anywhere else he's seen.

Dean stands on the road, looking up, eyes closed, lips quivering. *Cas.*

The air is chilly, as cold as Alaska is supposed to be, but not any colder. His breathing forms thin white fog. The surrounding is quiet, so quiet that he can hear nothing but his heart beating heavily in his chest. *Cas.*

He reaches inside the innermost chest pocket. The piece of cloth and feather are still there. He holds on to them, as if the mere touch of them can give him the strength and hope that is losing fast. *Cas.*

There is a pistol on the right side of his belt, and the demon blade on the left. *Death is the infinite vessel.* Dean finds himself wondering, which would be an easier way to go.

There is a whizzing sound starting on the horizon, moving through the sky quickly. The sound is no louder than cracks of static electrical sparks on the clothes in dry autumn days.

Dean opens his eyes.

There on the sky, the astonishing color and lights are forming and shifting. Bright and abundant in color, the lights are like moving clouds, flicking on the dark curtain of the sky. In fact, the lights are like curtains themselves. Dazzling green lights shape into vertical lines, as low as reaching to the ground, as high as outer space. The green curtain sweeps through the sky, leaving a lighter amber green shade on its trail.

Dean has never seen an aurora borealis before. He stares at the breathtaking scenes on the sky without blinking, wondering if it's something natural or there is a tear somewhere nearby. Wondering, if Cas is going to show up any time under this astonishingly beautiful sky.

The crackling sound gets louder, more like the snapping sound of a fire place burning now. And the bright aurora lights shift faster, moving across the sky as if they are alive. The vertical curtain shaped lights extend further and longer, then twist into shorter curves and circles, sliding away like snakes wriggling. The green color gets deeper, changing from the color of mint to lime and emerald.

Dean hovers his hand over the weapons on the belt, fingers edging on the handles but not closing on them. Waiting. He watches the massive sky, feeling small again. The infinity of color and lights.

More colors emerge, soon. There is so much more than green. The globe of the sky becomes an immense palette of color and light, the electrical sound fills the air, buzzing with electricity power as the moving lights intensify. Red aurora lights start showing on top of the other colors, floating and shivering, closely followed by a share of dazzling blue. Like flowing fire sweeping across the vault of sky.

Dean doesn't realize his cheek is wet until tears drop from his jaw. The grand magnificence catches his breath. The thought and prayer finally crawls their way out of his throat. The silent plead becomes low murmur, and Dean is saying: "Cas. Please. Come to me."

The crackling sound turns to louder sputtering, as if every particle in the air has been charged with electricity, and any movement of wind is sending power down its way. Dean feels his skin prickles with the electricity. He wonders how long it would take, for all the air from earth to sky to be so charged, that a smallest movement would turn a friction into a spark, just like in a gas station but millions times stronger, and the air and sky would turn into literal sea of flame, devouring any men in between.

He wraps the fingers on the demon blade, moving it in front of him. The tip close to the chest, not touching yet.

The air in front of him shakes violently. Dean holds his breath, watching it tear open from the other side, becoming a large black scar hanging vertically in the mid-air.

A figure manifests slowly from the tear. The disheveled hair is the first to emerge, showing up at a thousand feet height on the top. Followed closely by the giant human-shaped body, covered by an enormous trench coat, standing steadily on the ground. Behind the body, there are three pairs of tremendous wings, spreading high and wide, leaving long dark shadows under the bright aurora lights, holding very still. And at the very top, the weirdest thing ever, Dean finds himself being stared by countless eyes all at once, spread on three gigantic spinning rings.

Dean forgets how to breathe.
