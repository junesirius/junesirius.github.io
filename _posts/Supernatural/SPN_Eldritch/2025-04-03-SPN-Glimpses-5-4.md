Along with it, the sunshine loses its color and warmth.

"Dean," Cas lowers his eyes. "I really don't --"

Dean shushes him with a finger on his lips. "You can argue all you want later, Cas, but we'll patch you up first, alright? Before anything else, let's fix your body first."

"But that wouldn't be necessary if I need to go back to the dimension in between again," Cas points out.

"*Need to?* You don't fucking *need to* go back to that horrible place, Cas!" Dean snaps. "You can just stay here!"

"But that's my responsibility!" Cas snaps back.

"And my responsibility is to keep you alive!" Dean raises his voice.

"And mine is not?" Cas raises his.

They stare at each other, nose to nose, inches apart, falling into sudden silence.

For both of them, one of their hands is clenched into a fist in exhaustion, the other... Dean realizes in a sudden fascination that he's still holding Cas's hand. And Cas seems to realize it at the same moment. He makes a small attempt to pull away, but Dean doesn't let go. So Cas gives up trying.

Dean has a vague gut-deep feeling as if the moment he lets the hand slip, Cas will be gone again. Just like the millions of times in memory replays and nightmare hauntings, the moment the palms slip and the weight lightens, Castiel would disappear. It happened in Purgatory, and it feels like it had happened and will happen for so many more times. Dean just can't take any more.

His voice is hoarse. Cas decidedly keeps his eyes on their hands now, not meeting his gaze.

Dean asks him, gentle this time, "I'll only ask this one thing, then, just this one time. But I want you to be absolutely honest with me, honest with yourself, alright, Cas? If you say no, then I'll stop arguing."

He pauses there for a moment, and Cas nods. His eyes drop even lower than where they focused on to. As if the bottom of the sea suddenly sinks, even lower than the Mariana Trench, and the color of all the oceans deepens so many shades that it shows in Castiel's eyes.

And Dean asks him: "Do you *want* to come back? To Earth?" He hesitates for a second, then adds, quieter, "To me?"

*If we can forget what we need to do, forget everything the world and fate and destiny ask, if we can just live for our own lives and forget about all the consequences, if I choose to stay, will you choose to stay too? Will you come back, to where I am?*

Dean breathes shallowly. He almost forgets to breathe. He doesn't know whether to keep his eyes on Cas's lowered eyes where he can only see the flickering eyelashes, or on their joined fingers. He squeezes the fingers slightly. *Please, be honest. Please, come to me.*

And Cas looks up. He says, agonizingly, "Yes. More than anything. But --"

Dean is already saying, "It's settled, then. Let's patch you up." With a sudden blossomed smile. His breathing evens out smoothly now.

Cas squeezes his fingers back.

Dean lays his hands -- the real hands in the real world now -- on the edge of Cas's giant vessel's hand. Palm to palm, in the best sense he can manage.

"Okay, Cas, you're up, do you magic," Dean says cheerfully to the air, directing the words toward the back corner of his mind.

Cas sits down on Bobby's sofa in Dean's mind. "I know you'd hate losing control," he says. "You can be the driver. I'll be the fuel."

Dean blinks. "Didn't know that was on the menu."

"Imagine you're an angel," says Cas, *imagine you're me*. "The grace is all at your disposal." *All of me is at your disposal.*

Dean swears he hears the double take of the words Cas just said. *Guess now that we're sharing a brain room, there is nowhere to hide thoughts then.* Dean muses.

Which just gets confirmed by Cas's quiet thought: *Yes*.

They don't even need to talk now. Just the exchange of thoughts would do the talking. Almost like... two-way prayer, minus the praying. Something like a real soul phone this time.

Dean tries to imagine how it's like to really *be* an angel, as giant and bright as he can imagine, channeling the grace into his hand. It isn't easy in the first try, the mortal feeling is still too strong, his feet too stuck to the ground he can't fly. Then, the lighter feeling comes in. He remembers the flying particles in the air and the shifting plasma that creates the colors and lights of the aurora, the vision of color and light. He imagines being an angel -- being Cas -- walking the Earth, seeing the greatest and smallest things, carving the Grand Canyon, building a galaxy, witnessing the universe from its birth to its doom.

He imagines three pairs of wings spreading from his back from the shoulder blades, he imagines looking down at the earth as if he's flying, or his eyes are a thousand feet high, and he has thousands of them. He imagines white-blue light pouring from his eyes. For a moment, Dean feels so disoriented at the imagination he wonders if it's still his own mind imagining, or it's Cas's memories seeping in.

Golden lights flow out from Dean's palms, sinking into the giant body. The centers of his palms grow warm. The air around the glowing light seems to boil, like the shimmering air over burning asphalt on a hot summer day, melting and warping, making the distant view ripple. Or like the air above a burning pyre.

The heated air around the body changes the form and shape of the flesh, just like the vision of stretched roads shift through the waves of heated air. Shortly, Dean finds it difficult to tell if it's because the air deceives the vision, or the actual physical shape of Cas's body is being transformed. Some distant part of his body seems to be sizing down, but Dean can't really tell for sure. There are more lights gathering.

He continues to try anyway, focusing on the thought that he's fixing Cas's body, using the grace inside him that feels almost like part of him now. Dean still finds the idea too unearthly, he would rather it were like fixing the Impala's engine, where he can lift the hood, disconnect and reconnect pipes, find the broken parts, and fix them with wrenches and screwdrivers. It's easy.

He is good at fixing things, he has always been. And the process of seeing something recover from broken, it calms him. *He's not the one who breaks things, he's the one who fixes them,* Dean thinks. He just wishes he were as good at fixing everything else, beyond the Impala.

His mind wanders back to the time when he had to watch Sam hurt really badly by the hallucinations of Lucifer, then Cas hurt as badly after taking over the brokenness. Though Dean never really knew what happened in their heads back then. Something thousands of times worse than he could imagine, he can only presume.

The view is even more wobbly now, the air fills with more sparkling lights of small flying particles, brighter than what he'd just started to get used to. The vision feels like plain human sight overlaid with a layer of celestial special effect on top, then another brighter layer, covering the reality. He can barely make out the giant body in front of him clearly now. He finds his own attention slipping.

Dean blinks. The view changes completely.
