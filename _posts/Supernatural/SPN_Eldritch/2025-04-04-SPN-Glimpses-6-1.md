A sudden chilly air blows against his body, Dean shivers at the drop in temperature. It is different from the icy wind in Alaska though, more like... Dean glances around on instinct, and spots an open window with a thin fluttering curtain. He looks around, bewildered. The view seems somewhat familiar, but he can't quite place it immediately.

The walls are white, as is the small single bed in the center of the room, with protective bars on all four sides. It's an infirmary bed. He's in a hospital, of some sort.

Dean looks down at himself, and freezes. He's in hospital clothing, soft white shirt and pants. The same hospital garb he saw Cas in near the end of last year on Earth, and the whole time in Purgatory. Dean has to drape the trench coat over him to smother the sick feeling rising at the sight and the reminder of the meaning of that hospital dressing. But he still sees it all the time anyway. His right wrist bears a blue paper band.

"Cas?" Dean frowns hard at the hand in his view -- the hand that undoubtedly belongs to Cas, and whispers. "Is this... your memory?"

Cas's voice passes into his mind slowly, surprised as well, a soft "Oh," followed by, "I think it might be because of my grace. Some memories are too deeply entangled with the grace, when you channel it, they pass through your soul. The process may affect your perceptions, as if seeing through my eyes."

He pauses, hesitating.

*There are some things he doesn't want me to see.* Dean thinks, feeling the edge of some emotion start to crawl up.

"No, Dean, not hiding from you, not lying," Cas's voice is already answering to his realization before the names of these emotions can settle in, before Dean can really take a grasp of them fully. "I will not do that again. But these memories, they might be uncomfortable to watch. I just don't want you harmed."

"You lived through them, didn't you?" Dean says, not waiting for an answer. "Surely it can't hurt me like the past hurt you. The least I can do is learn how bad it was."

Cas falls silent for a moment, then says very quietly, "Dean, some of them are really bad."

And Dean answers him, "Close your eyes then, if you don't want to relive them. Hold my hand if you want." They're not exactly face to face in any sense at this moment, mentally or physically, so really, it's just metaphorical. But Cas gets it. He doesn't argue. As if his consciousness leans back onto Bobby's sofa with a still slightly tensed back.

The view of the hospital tunes in and out, as if looking through a bad telescope, its focus lens screwed and shifting constantly. Dean squints at the view, feeling a nasty headache beginning to grow at the base of his skull just from trying to look.

He murmurs, "That's how you saw things during those times, Cas? And I was blaming you for being... you know, nuts?"

*That was on the better days,* Cas answers in thought.

"God, I'm sorry." A sigh slips out of Dean, "What's a bad day like?"

Cas stays quiet, but as if in response, the view shifts again. The hospital dissolves into a library, a beautiful, ancient library that Dean has only seen in the fanciest movie scenes. The arched ceilings are so tall they might as well be the sky, the corridors stretch long and wide. There are countless bookshelves with delicately carved markings and ornate decorations soaring toward the ceiling like the towering pillars of cathedrals from Roman era. And then there are the books, so many books that Dean imagines should all have been kept neatly on the shelves, indexed and illustrated, carefully sorted and placed. Except, they are not.

The library is a post-tornado mess. The remnants of its beauty and grandeur remain, but the books are so scattered that Dean doesn't know if there is a place he can step without accidentally treading on the loose pages -- instinctively, he knows these pages are important, every single one of them. The pages are torn and jumbled, the beautifully carved glistening covers lie among them all over the floor. The shelves are disoriented as well, only those in his immediate vicinity standing in roughly parallel lines. Further down the corridor, countless of them have been knocked over, the remaining standing ones are tilted left and right, as if someone had started fixing them but only managed to straighten the very few near the beginning edge of the wreckage, there is still so much more to go. The whole place looks more like a crumpled sea of random pages than a library, the papers piled on the floor, some fluttering in the air. The shelves look empty.

But when Dean looks closer, he notices the shelves are not all empty. The ones closest to him, the few that have been straightened and put back in place, some books have been reassembled and returned to the racks. The covers and pages are still visibly torn, but they remain standing at the edge of each rack. *Survivors of the tornado? Maybe?* Dean thinks, finding comfort in seeing that there are remaining books on the shelves, that the place is not completely ruined.

"What's this place?" Dean asks. Cas doesn't answer.

Instead, Dean finds his body kneeling down to the floor, reaching for a page -- not *his* body, Dean mentally corrects himself, it's Cas's memory, it's Cas's body for the moment. His fingers touch the page closest to him, and his eyes begin to read. There is an illustration of a cat on the page, a lazy tabby lying down, tongue stuck out, long and pink, staring at him. The text beneath it reads, "*Sharp spines or papillae can be found in a cat's tongue, there are five types of papillae...*" followed by some other notes and facts about cats.

His finger turns the page. On the other side, there is a different section about some other knowledge of cats, and it starts talking about "*Felines, especially domestic cats, are well known for having penile spines, which is needed to stimulate the female cat into ovulation...*"

He hears a low sigh escaping his throat, fingers brushing the words "female cat," and his voice mutters, "*I know for a fact the females were not consulted about that.*" The vision flickers between the library and hospital briefly as the voice comes through, like Cas is talking to someone in a different place. The view from the hospital is more like a translucent ripple overlay, but Dean catches a glimpse of himself and Sam standing there, faces worried and annoyed.

The view sharpens back to the library. His body stands up, and tucks the page into one of the books on the shelf to his right. The cover reads "*Anatomy of the Cat*", and it's about half as thick as the book is supposed to be, judging by the spine, all the pages loose. And with a glance, Dean realizes all the other books on the shelves are all in similar condition -- worn, torn, pages unbound -- but Cas is putting them back in.

Cas walks back to the pile of books that is mountain-high, and reaches down to pick up another page. This one has some monkeys dancing around a bonfire, seemingly singing and talking, as if highly intelligent, just like human... oh, not monkeys, those are the primal human beings. Dean glances at the note, which says something about Neanderthals and their poetries and rituals. Dean finds his head dizzy again. Cas, in the memory, in his mental body, just straightens up from the floor, walks over to the shelves, and slides the page into a different book on a different shelf, labeled "*Human Evolution*". And he goes back for the next page.

The realization weighs on his chest so heavy that Dean fears his ribs might get crushed any second. He wants to raise a hand to clutch his chest, but the body feels fine. Breathing is normal. The body is still moving through the memory, replaying the movement like a pre-programed robot.

The random comments here and there. The fragments of knowledge and glints of attention. "*Did you know that a cat's penis is sharply barbed along its shaft?*" "*I was backing the Neanderthals because their poetry was... just amazing. It's in perfect tune with the spheres. You guys ate the apple, invented pants.*" The Cas in the hospital, smiling at him wild and innocent like a child, holding up a finger saying "Pull it," and then starting to drop random notes about cats and dogs and monkeys and bees...

Dean stares at the pages and books and shelves again, feeling his eyes would sting if he had control over the body.

The pieces.

These are all the pieces of Cas's mind.

Broken.

Torn apart.

Like a tornado swept through the library. All the knowledge is still here, but so scattered, so broken, that he has to put them back, piece by piece, page by page, reading each one of them, putting them back in order, then moving on to the next. Each page might come from a far too different topic, a different book, a different area of the brain. He takes the page, walks to the correct shelf, places it between the covers, then walks back, and does the same again for the next one. Over and over again.

"*It took everything to get me here.*" Cas had already told him that, back then, in the hospital, hadn't he? But Dean didn't listen, he just, couldn't understand. Dean winces, wondering what had distracted him at that time, how he could let that statement slip past without really asking, "*What happened?*" Then he remembers. He was angry, back then, so angry that all he could think about was snapping at Cas, telling him to "button up his coat and help them take down the Leviathans," because he was thinking, that was all his fault. All the while Cas was in here, inside his own head, going round and round, piecing himself back together. Piece by piece. With no help.

"I'm sorry," says Cas.

His voice startles Dean.

"What?"

He means, *Why are you apologizing? I should be the one. I should have known things were difficult, so difficult. You were already doing your best, you're always doing your best. Whatever the result, you tried, you tried so damn hard. I should have known. I should have at least asked...*

And Cas says again, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry I destroyed everything. I'm sorry I was afraid I would destroy everything again. I'm sorry about all the mess and..."

"Cas," Dean stops him, barely able to find his own voice. "I'm sorry, too. And I forgive you, Cas. I forgave you a long time ago."

But Cas is still saying, "I'm sorry..." As if his mind has slipped back into that old broken self, looped like a faulty cassette tape, playing the only message it can still hold on to. His mental body picks up another page, and another. He reads them, and puts them in the right places. His thought moves faintly through the haze: *I'm sorry I was broken. I'm sorry I'm broken again. I need to piece myself together. I need to put myself back together because there is something important outside that needs fixing, because there is someone important outside who's waiting for me, because we also have too many important things to fix...*

"Hey, hey, Cas, Cas." Dean nudges him mentally, thinking to take back control from the spiral, focusing on the view of Bobby's living room, the sunshine spilling onto the carpet through the window.

And he is steered back into that warm bright sunshine and the lazy afternoon they never had. Cas slumps in the corner of the sofa where the sunshine can't reach, curled up small, arms wrapped tightly around his knees, as if trying to hold himself together the best he can. As if he really is still broken. His eyes are unfocused, his lips murmur over and over again, "I'm sorry."

Dean puts a hand on his shoulder. Cas startles. The loop breaks. His lips still tremble, but no sound comes out. His eyes fragile.

Dean lowers himself in front of the sofa, edging closer to his side, wrapping an arm around him in a gesture to pull the angel toward him. His eyes level with Cas's.

"Listen to me," he starts, then pauses, his thoughts wandering back to Cas's library. The grand, beautiful hall, the ancient shelves, the countless books. All the knowledge and memory he held, all the millions of years he lived through. What would it look like when Cas is not broken? When everything is ancient and elegant? Must be breathtaking. Must be as spectacular and beautiful as everything that Cas is. Dean tells him, firmly, "You're forgiven, Cas." And, "You're not broken. Even if you are, I can help fix, I'm good at it. Don't worry. We'll figure it out."

Cas's ocean-blue eyes focus on Dean's. The look of broken pieces is still lingering in that deep blue ocean water, like shattered glass floating on the surface of a wave. But he nods, small.

There is still so much glistening pain in those eyes, so much guilt and regret and apology, drifting like dark fog ghosting over the sea. But he tries to straighten up slightly on the sofa, all the while keeping his gaze locked on Dean, and says, after a while, quietly, "Thank you."

He leans into the arms wrapped around him, returning the embrace.

Dean holds him tight, hands caressing his back gently in a soothing motion. Like those huge wings once did.
