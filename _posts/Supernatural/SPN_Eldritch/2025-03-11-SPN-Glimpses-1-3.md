It's freezing cold outside. In fact, "freezing" is just too weak of a term for this temperature. Any word that can be thought of for this weather has already been blown away by the blizzard and frozen into the ground.

Dean can sense every inch of skin is dropping temperature fast, he might only have minutes, or seconds, before he may literally frozen to death -- if he's not buried alive first.

But knowing what he knows now, there is no way he would just sit inside and do nothing. He can fight through the Purgatory from one end to the other, certainly he can survive some snow storm in Colorado.

Dean walks into the storm, and starts walking towards the mountaintop, where the rumors hold. The snowflakes are as sharp as blades, cutting him bloody, but there is no dripping blood. Even the sliced veins are frozen to contact the minute they're wounded.

He can't see anything, there is nothing other than a whole complete whiteness in front of him, with all kinds of different sharpness and shades. He pushes one step after another, but can't tell the difference between each step. He wonders if he's really moving up, or just making the same movement in the same place.

The storm gets more fierce when the top is nearer. The trees are getting sparse, the color of the snow darker. Dean widens his eyes to the biggest extend, searching the sky, the ground, the wood, the mountain. Searching the whole world for a glimpse of color that is different from the whiteness. Looking for a footprint or a hint of beige.

"This is just suicide, Dean." The voice he's way too familiar with sounds up somewhere close by.

"Cas?" Dean spins around, turning sharp towards the sound.

"Dangerous, reckless, and stupid. You could die here, buried alive, and I'd never find you or your corpse again, you ever thought about that?" Cas's voice scolding.

"What?" Dean stills. Thinking, then tries, "You're not real, aren't you? I'm hallucinating you?"

"Hypothermia could lead to highly realistic hallucination. It's scientifically tested and confirmed already." "Cas" walks out of the storm, standing in front of him. In his clean trench coat and straight suit, blue tie tilted and reversed in the front. Hairs unbelievably disheveled but not moving in the storm wind. Eyes as blue as the deepest sea and highest autumn sky. The view of the angel of the lord as he remembered from the first time they met, the look he forever dreamed about among all the other looks that he had.

"Cas." Dean murmurs, reaching out to him, fingers catching nothing but snowflakes. Though the snow doesn't feel cold anymore.

He puts a sad smile, looking at "Cas" in the eyes. "I've been looking for you, Cas. Promised I'd find you and bring you home. But looks like I can't even keep that promise, I'm sorry."

"Cas" has a smile just as sad as his. "You're dying, Dean." He tells him, then. "And I won't allow that happen."

Dean can't really think straight right now, the low temperature makes his brain as sluggish as his hands and feet, working slower by each second, just like the gradually slowing down heart beat sound that he hears of his own.

That is when the view in front of his eyes changes entirely. Dean blinks slowly, can't understand what he's seeing.

It is as if the storm is split into half, like a curtain drawing open on the opera stage. A figure as tall as sky emerges, stepping towards him slowly. Each step stomping on the ground, shaking the earth, like the giant from the Jack and Beanstalk story.

Dean wants to step back, wants to look up, wants to speak. There are so many things he wants to do, the instinct is telling him to run away, or to fight, but his body is too frozen to move. So he just stares, feeling the newly risen adrenalin forcing the heart beating faster. His brain struggles to parse the reality and the view.

The figure wears a long trench coat, reaching to his knees, which is taller than the highest tree in their surroundings. Dean looks up, head as high as his frozen neck allows but still can't see the head of the figure. He gasps, his sound choked in his throat.

It is Cas. It is undoubtedly Cas. But it is so unlike Cas, not in any form they have ever known. Not in any history or legend. But it is Cas, for sure.

Dean would know him from anywhere, in any form. Not just the trench coat, but his existence. The weight of his stare falling on to him even if he can't see his eyes; the heat of concern radiating from his body, almost practically melting the snow and ice surround them. And most of all, who else would ever like this, always comes to him at the moment of dying. Hell is the first time, Green Room the second, Dean has long lost count of how many more are there.

"Cas." This time Dean really is smiling now. Dirt and snow and hint of blood and cuts smudged on his face, making the smallest of pull of muscle a pain, but he's smiling now, big and stupidly.

He steps forward, but Cas retracts. There is a thunderous sound rolling from above, as if coming directly from the sky, low and deafening, like the rage of Greek gods on top of the Olympics Mount.

But it's not a voice of rage, nor warning. Dean can't understand the syllable, but if he knows Cas at all -- which he does -- then he'd know, this is his own name. He would have known his own name in every single tongue Cas knows, and the tone would remain the same.

He takes another step forward, carefully, but Cas's figure takes another step back. The blizzard around them starts roaring again, reaching back to the same amount of intensity and fierceness. But surround Dean, there is still a safe little area of warmth, blocked out from Cas's body.

"What's wrong?" Dean manages, sound covered by the blizzard the moment they leave his mouth.

Cas makes another sound, one word, not "Dean", certainly not "Hello".

"No, no, no, no! Cas!" Dean yells, desperate, "Wait! Don't! Not 'Goodbye' again! Not so soon!"

Cas turns around. That is when he sees it. A tear in the space, like a big ugly wound of the reality standing vertical, opening up like Sauron's evil eye glaring down at the earth. Grey and black smoke flowing in and out of the edge, like curtains flying in the wind. The blizzard starts right from the center of it.

"Cas..." Dean hates it he can't do anything, especially when he knows exactly what is going to happen next, the same nightmare that he's been having for ages, after the day of the Cage opening, after Cas walking into the river. The same worst thing he feared every single night at the Purgatory, and it seems, with Cas, it's just gonna keep replaying.

Cas is right in front of that huge tear of the dimension now. Bright light start leaking out from him, seeping into the opening, weaving onto it like needles and threads fixing a patch on a piece of cloth.

"Please..." Dean begs, so quiet even himself can barely hear it. Cas's figure starts fade, lights dimming, the hole shrinking. But right before it gets completely sewed up by the bright light of grace, a slicker thread of light flies away from the rest, flying towards Dean.

Dean watches it, not realizing his eyes are so teary that the light of the grace is all fuzzed and smudged like a piece of water soaked art. The thread of light fly onto his forehead, touches his skin and immediately sinks into it.

The warmth soaks him from top to bottom, chasing the last hint of coldness from the snow storm out of his body. The exact same feeling whenever Cas touches him and heals him.

Dean looks up again. At the place where the tear of the space was, it is now a clean smooth stand of sky, and air. There is no nasty thing from other dimension, there is no bright light of needles and threads.

There is no Cas, again. Except for the lingering warmth that still flows in his body.

The snow storm has stopped, he realizes, when the tear is fixed.
