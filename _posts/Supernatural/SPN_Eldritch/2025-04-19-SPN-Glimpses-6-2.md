So Dean continues.

In the outside world, more light and grace flow through his palms, layering onto the giant vessel, coating the body like a blanket made of radiance. The body becomes visibly smaller now, shrinking from the size of a huge mountain and height of a skyscraper, to the size of a hill and possibly height of the tallest cathedral in the world. But the light fills in the gaps, as if it's not shrinking, just dissolving into a different form.

There probably shouldn't be that much light, Dean thinks, his eyes tracking the waves of brightness, wondering how the physics of grace works, and decides, if it triggers another physics lecture filled with all the terminologies from Cas, he'll have to skip the class.

But really, the grace is pouring from him and into Cas's body, not just channeling from the center of his palms, it expands to his whole hands, then whole arms, then, without needing to look down at himself, Dean knows his whole body is lightened up by the grace, and the light just continues flowing from everywhere. Unstoppably.

Should he be worried? Dean feels the first pull of panic start to coil in the pit of his stomach. Will it eventually drain Cas's grace? But really, is all this light coming from Cas's grace? The brightness and the way it flows, swirling and thickening, it feels familiar, it almost looks like the light is regenerating, multiplying, growing on itself like some kind of nuclear reaction.

Now that he thinks about it, that theory seems increasingly plausible. "Cas, am I going to explode into light or something?" Dean rushes.

"I don't think so," Cas answers, but the voice doesn't sound convincing. "I hope not."

That is when a great surge of grace dashes out of Dean, right near his heart, brushing hard against some core essence deep inside him. The warmth from the grace skyrockets into a near-burning sensation. Dean let out an uncontrollable yell that is bouldering pain. Though not exactly unpleasant, more surprised. *The Hell was that? Felt like my soul just got touched or something.*

*Yes. Sorry.* Cas's thought comes through as soon as Dean's own thought forms. *I'm afraid it might indeed be a chain reaction. Somehow, your soul is outputting energy along with my grace. I'm so sorry, I didn't know it was possible, I would never harm you...*

*I know, Cas. How do we stop a nuclear explosion?*

*I don't know.* Cas is deeply worried, making a mental move as if he's about to leave Dean's body.

*Hell no, you don't jump the car when it's racing out of control.* Dean keeps his hold on Cas steady, mentally and physically. *You buckle up for one hell of a roller coaster ride, you hear me? We sail through the storm, together.*

Dean huffs, pressing his hands onto the body harder. Judging by the way the light and power and electricity are pouring out, he knows as a fact, whatever is coming, he'll need a firm grip to keep from falling apart. Especially when there is someone else in the passenger seat.

<br>

The view ripples and shakes so violently that Dean loses sense of reality seconds later. The movies and images in front of his eyes shift so extremely rapidly like a tape player uncontrollably rewinding and replaying at random.

He sees a grey sky and ominous shades of trees swaying, monsters eying covetously. Dean sees his own back, from Cas's view, holding the bone blade, slashing at attacking leviathans and all other monsters. Cas dodges and ducks and strikes back at the ones that lunge at him, but all the while, Dean notices, his own figure always, always remains in the frame. Every time he's even slightly overwhelmed, Cas comes to his side.

He thinks back to his own memories, and the view shifts with his train of thought. He's killing the monsters, fierce and ruthless. He glares at the ones charging at him, and watches for the ones coming at Cas. He glances at Cas's hand that usually grips an angel blade but empty this time, he itches to hand him his blade. Instead, he throws himself in front of Cas, blocking the hideous looks those surrounding leviathans hurl toward him. He kills them before they can get within arm's reach to Cas.

*Oh.* Dean hears Cas's quiet voice murmur at the view from the back of the head, knowing he's watching the same scene replayed from a different angle for the first time.

*Yeah, fun time.* Dean shoots him a thought. *Nice teamwork.*

*It is truly great teamwork.* Cas agrees.

Then the swirly blue-white portal comes into view. At the first glimpse Dean isn't sure whose memory it is, then he knows it's Cas's, because the steps become more unstable and shakier than he remembers for himself. The portal draws closer with every step, Cas's pace grows slower and more sluggish by each step, but it's not from exhaustion. His own voice calls out from the memory, yelling over the the growls of monsters and the gust: "Come on, Cas, come on!" He sees his own eyes glancing back, checking on Cas, worried but hopeful, at least the way out is right in front of them now. Then there is Cas's thought replaying from the memory: *I should be left behind. I don't deserve to be saved.*

Dean blurts out at that, "You sound just like me when we first met, you remember that?"

Surprised, Cas stutters. He makes a sound that is like nothing other than swallowing. Then, slowly, "Yes, I remember. And I finally understand now."

"And you remember what you said to me back then?"

"Yes."

"Tell me."

"I told you, back then, good things do happen. You deserve to be saved."

Dean really wants to hold stare with Cas's eyes in this moment, but he figures Cas gets the idea. "You mean that, and you believe it?"

"Of course, Dean. For you, always," Cas answers earnestly.

"Then remember, same goes for you. Alright?" Dean tells him firmly.

*Even if my mistakes are far worse and more beings were devastated?* Cas doesn't put it into words but Dean receives the thought anyway.

The view now is composed of flashes of bloody scenes on Earth and even more horrifying scenes of dead angels butchered on the grounds of Heaven. Burned-out wings from dead angels stain the meadow for miles, there must be hundreds, if not thousands, of angels there. Cas stands in the center of the site, looking down at them, announcing his coronation and verdict as the new God.

Cas makes a terrified, sick sound at the view as if he's about to throw up.

Dean remembers the basement that night, the alien look on Cas's face, the disdain in his eyes when he said they were all but ants to him. He had been about to kneel before him, his heart thumping with such agony he couldn't breathe. Dean wasn't resentful, no, he was mourning. The Cas that was his friend was gone, murdered by his own hand, and this being with the same face was not Cas anymore, because even he'd already said so: "the Castiel you know is gone." Then Dean remembers the blood dripping from Cas's mouth, leviathans twisting his face. The floating, bloody trench coat in the water.

The view shifts to that lakeside, and the only thing in sight, is that damp trench coat, washed up and down by the water.

Everything is so hard to see, to think about, even harder to say. But he has to tell Cas this. "Yes, even with that. Hell, who says yours is worse anyway? I jump-started the Apocalypse, that didn't stop you from saving me. So yeah, no, wouldn't stop me whatsoever."

*Even if I betrayed you and hurt Sam?* This thought comes through extremely painful and difficult, as if it is literally cutting Cas open and tearing him apart again just by thinking it, blood would drip from the edges of the thought. But it is also so obvious he's never really stopped thinking it, never stopped beating himself up for it. Never will be, really.

Dean stumbles at that, but swallows and steadies himself. "Just... just don't do that again."

*I'm sorry.*

"I know. Cas. I know." Dean takes a long, ragged breath. "I forgave you. Now it's time you forgive yourself."

*How do you do that?*

Dean almost chuckles. "If only I know. But hey, we are on the same boat."

The flashing images from the memory slow down in the view: the broken pieces, the dazzling light, the confusing scenes of the dimension in between, the long and ugly past, the Hell, the Purgatory. Some are Cas's, others Dean's. Many times, they find the pieces mixed together. One by one, they pick them up, sort them out, as if cleaning a floor where all the glassware and chinaware have been shattered, and they work together to put them back, glue them together. The edges are sharp, the broken pieces tiny, but they work together. One by one, piece by piece, just like Cas puts torn book pages in his memory library back onto the shelves, just like Dean's djinn dream of the dimension in between, where they put the pieces of cloth fabric and feathers together to make a Picasso-style form turn to a Leonardo da Vinci work of art.

"There, you're the new Mona Lisa now. Fresh and new." After the last piece of aching memory flashes by and settles down, the view shifts back to the comfortable corner in Dean's head, back to Bobby's house. Dean pats fondly on Cas's shoulder, half-joking. *You're more beautiful than Mona Lisa.* His thought slips out, uncontrollably.

Cas tilts his head toward him, a small grin. "You know I can hear that too."

Dean flushes slightly. "Can't blame a man for thinking the truth."

His arms are still wrapped around Cas, their posture unchanged since all the roller coaster twists and turns began. And now, finally, it feels like they've landed somewhere.

The corner of the sofa where they stay, the sunlight covers it now. Warm and calming.

Cas uncurls his body, turning slightly on the sofa to face Dean. His eyes lock on Dean's, unblinking, watery.

Dean finds his own gaze drawn in like a magnet. He can see himself reflected in Cas's eyes. The intensity makes his head spin, the whole world around them disappears. He drowns in the blue, thinking, *Nothing in the world is more perfect.*

And an echoing thought returns, *Yes, there is. You.*

Dean blinks, eyes widening slightly, face flushed hotter.

Cas's eyes sweeps down, over his cheek, landing on his lips, then back to his eyes.

Dean catches every movement of his eyes, swallows, then leans in carefully.

Cas pulls him in, closing the remaining distance between their lips.

Dean closes his eyes, indulging himself in the feeling. His heart warm and swelling.

Cas is not the only one being pieced back together here.
