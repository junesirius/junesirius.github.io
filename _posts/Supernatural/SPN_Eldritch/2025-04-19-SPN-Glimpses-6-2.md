So Dean continues.

In the outside world, more lights and grace flow through his palms, layering onto the giant vessel, coating the body like a blanket made of light. The body becomes visibly smaller now, from the shape of a huge mountain and height of a skyscraper, to the size of a hill and possibly height of the highest cathedral and library in the world. But the lights fill in the gaps, as if it's not shrinking, just dissolving into a different form.

There probably shouldn't have been that much lights. Dean thinks, eyes following the wave of lights, wondering how the physics of the grace works, and decides, if that triggers another physics lecture with all the terminologies from Cas, he'll have to skip the class.

But really, the grace is pouring out from him and into Cas's body, not just channeling from the center of the palm, it expands to his whole hand, then whole arm, then, without needing to look down on himself, Dean knows his whole body is lightened up by the grace, and the light of the grace is continuing flowing out non-stoppingly.

Should he start worrying? Dean feels a pull of panic start accumulating at the bottom of his gut again. Will it eventually drain Cas's grace? But really, is all the light coming from Cas's grace? The brightness and the way they flow around, swirling and thickening, it almost looks like the lights are regenerating, multiplying, growing on themselves like nuclear reaction.

Now that he thinks about it, that theory seems increasingly plausible. "Cas, am I going to explode into light or something?" Dean hushes.

"I don't think so," Cas answers, but the voice doesn't sound convincing. "I hope not."

That is when a great surge of grace dash out of Dean right near his heart, brushing hard on some core essence of his internal. The warmth from the grace skyrockets to a near burning sensation. Dean let out an uncontrollable yell that is bouldering pain. Though not exactly unpleasant, more surprised. *The Hell is that? Feel like my soul just get touched or something.*

*Yes. Sorry.* Cas's thought comes through as soon as Dean's own thought forms. *I'm afraid it might indeed be a chain reaction, somehow your soul is outputting energy along with my grace. I'm so sorry, I didn't know it's possible, I would never harm you...*

*I know, Cas. How do we stop a nuclear explosion?*

*I don't know.* Cas is deeply worried, making a mental move as if he's about to leave Dean's body.

*Hell no, you don't jump the car when it's racing out of control.* Dean keeps his hold on Cas steady, mentally and physically. *You buckle up for hell of a roller coaster trip, you hear me? We sail through the storm, together.* Dean huffs, pressing his hands on the body harder. By the ways the light and power and electricity pouring out, he knows as a fact, whatever is coming, he would need a steady hold to not fall. Especially when there is someone else on the passenger seat.

<br>

The view ripples and shakes so violently that Dean loses sense of the reality seconds later. The movies and images in front of his eyes shift so extremely rapidly like a tape player uncontrollably rewind and replay at random places.

He sees grey sky and ominous shades of trees swaying, monsters eying covetously. Dean sees his own back, from Cas's view, holding the bone blade, slashing the attacking leviathans and all other monsters. Cas dodges and ducks and strikes back too, for the ones that jump him, but all the while, Dean notices, his own figure is always, always remain in the view. Every time he's slightly overwhelmed, Cas comes to his side.

He thinks back to his own experience, and the view shifts along with his train of thought. He's killing the monsters, fierce and ruthless. He glares at the ones that are coming to him, and he watches out for the ones coming to Cas. He glances at Cas's hand that usually would hold an angel blade but empty this time, he itches to hand him his blade. Instead, he throws himself in front of Cas, blocking the hideous looks those surrounding leviathans shoot at him. He kills them before they can reach within an arm's distance to Cas.

*Oh.* Dean hears Cas's quiet voice murmur at the view from the back of the head, knowing he's watching the same scene replayed from the different angle for the first time.

*Yeah, fun time.* Dean shoots him a thought. *Nice teamwork.*

*It is truly great teamwork.* Cas agrees.

Then the swirly blue-white portal comes into the sight. At first glimpse Dean isn't sure whose memory it is, then he knows it's Cas's, because the steps become more unstable and shaky than he remembers for himself. The portal gets closer by each step, Cas's steps are slower and more sluggish by each step, but it's not from exhaustion. His own voice sounds up from the memory, yelling over the monsters' growling and wind: "Come on, Cas, come on!" He sees his own eyes glancing back, checking on Cas, worried but hopeful, at least the way out is right in front of them now. Then there is Cas's thought replaying from the memory, *I should be left behind. I don't deserve to be saved.*

Dean blurts out at that, "You sound just like me when we first met, you remember that?"

Surprised, Cas stutters. He makes a sound that is like nothing other than swallowing. Then, slowly, "Yes, I remember. And I can finally understand now."

"And you remember what you said to me back then?"

"Yes."

"Tell me."

"I told you, back then, good things do happen. You deserve to be saved."

Dean really wants to hold the stare with Cas's eyes at this moment, but he thinks Cas gets the idea. "You mean that, and you believe that?"

"Of course, Dean. For you, always." Cas answers earnestly.

"Then remember, same for you. Alright?" Dean tells him firmly.

*Even if my mistakes are way worse and more beings are devastated?* Cas doesn't put it into words but Dean receives the thought anyway.

The view now is composed of flashes of bloody scenes on Earth and even more horrifying scenes of dead angels butchered on the ground of Heaven. Burned out wings from dead angels stain the meadow for miles, there must be hundreds if not thousands of angels there. Cas stands in the center of the site, looking down on them, announcing his coronation and verdict as the new God.

Cas makes a terrified, sick sound at the view as if he's about to throw up.

Dean remembers the basement that night, the look on Cas's face, the despise in his eyes when he said they are all but ants to him. He was about to kneel down before him, his heart thumped in so much agony he couldn't breathe. Dean wasn't resentful, no, he was mourning the Cas that was his friend was gone, and this being with the same face was not Cas anymore, because he has said so already, "the Castiel you know is gone." Then he remembers the blood dripping down Cas's mouth, leviathans twisting his face. The floating, bloody trench coat in the water.

The view shifts to that lakeside, and the only thing in sight, is that damp trench coat, washed up and down by the water.

Everything is so hard to see, to think, even harder to say it. But he has to tell Cas this. "Yes, even with that. Hell, who says yours is worse anyway. I jump started Apocalypse, that doesn't stop you from saving me, so yeah, no, wouldn't stop me whatsoever."

*Even if I betrayed you and hurt Sam?* This thought comes through extremely hard, as if it is literally cutting Cas open and tearing him apart again just by thinking it, blood would drip at the edge of the thought. But it is also so obvious he never really stops thinking it, never stops beating himself up for it.

Dean stumbles on that, but swallows and steadies himself. "Just, just don't do that again."

*I'm sorry.*

"I know. Cas. I know." Dean takes a long, shagged breath. "I forgave you."

The flashing images from the memory slow down in the view, the broken pieces, the dazzling light, the confusing scenes of the dimension in between, the long and ugly past, the hell, the purgatory. Some are Cas's, others are Dean's, many times, they find the pieces mixed together. One by one, they pick them up, sort them out, as if cleaning the floor where all the glassware and chinaware have been shattered, and they are working together to put them back, glue them together. The edges are sharp, the broken pieces are tiny, but they work together. One by one, piece by piece, just like Cas puts the torn book pages in his memory library back onto the shelves, just like Dean's djinn dream of the dimension in between and they put the pieces of cloth fabric and feather together to make a Picasso-style form turn to a Leonardo da Vinci art.

"There, you're the new Mona Lisa now. Fresh and new." After the last piece of aching memory piece flashed by and settled down, the view shifts back to the comfortable corner in Dean's head, back to Bobby's house. Dean pats fondly on Cas's shoulder, half-joking. *You're more beautiful than Mona Lisa.* His thought amends uncontrollably.

Cas tilts his head to him, a small grin. "You know I can hear that too."

Dean flushes slightly. "Can't blame a man thinking the truth."

His arms are still wrapped around Cas, the posture unchanged since all the roller coaster twists and turns started. And now, finally, it feels like they land somewhere.

Cas uncurls his body, turning slightly on the sofa, facing Dean. His eyes locked on Dean's, unblinking, watery.

Dean finds his own eyes attracted like magnetic. He can see himself from Cas's eyes. The intensity makes his head dizzy, the whole surrounding disappears. He drowns in the blue, thinking, *Nothing in the world is more perfect.*

And an echoing thought returns, *Yes, there is. You.*

Dean blinks, eyes widened slightly, face flushed hotter.

Cas's eyes sweeps down, over his cheek, land on his lips, then moves back to his eyes.

Dean catches every movement of his eyes, swallows, then leans in carefully.

Cas pulls him in, closing the remaining distance between their lips.

Dean closes his eyes, indulging himself in the feeling. His heart warm and swelling.

Cas is not the only one getting pieced together here.
