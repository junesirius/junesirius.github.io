It is dark.

This place.

It is shredding.

Cutting.

Confusing.

Everything is pieces.

Just pieces.

Floating.

Chaotic.

The dimension in between.

<br>

It takes time, really long time to find the pieces together.

But what is time, when time is not a dimension.

When time, can also be torn apart, like everything else, in this dimension.

Words are difficult to find, with characters and syllables.

Mind and body and grace and existence.

Which is the right place, for which piece of puzzle, floating by.

Woven, with the pain and bitter and guilt and penance.

Kneading, into every fabric.

Every fabric of the dimension.

Of my existence.

Who is building me up this time?

Not God. Me.

I'm putting me together.

But, then, Theseus's Ship,

Who am I?

<br>

It is dark.

Behind the curtain.

Lights are out.

Tear it down.

The voice says.

Tear it open, the light is on the other side.

<br>

Then,

Snow and cold.

Pain and real.

<br>

Hello.

Sorry.

The lights are out again.

The curtain is drawn back.

Good night.
