Lights in Castiel's eyes brighten up immediately in Dean's chanting, then through his mouth. Then through every single eye spread on the three spinning rings.

The lights are so bright that the sun would be ashamed of its dimness. Dean doesn't want to close his eyes, not this time. *If it burns, then let it burn.* He decides.

He keeps looking at Castiel, at his body that is too giant, at his face that is too high above in the mid-air, at the wings that spread wide and cast long shadows, at the rings that reflect silvery and spin like stars on orbits. Dean looks at Castiel as he is, in all the forms that he is, as a whole. He takes everything that is Castiel all in as if those are going to be the last things his eyes might ever see again -- which might be true. But he needs to see him, to time it right.

The lights start cover the wings, and the rings reflect as brightly, as though these angelic parts all start melting together into the grace.

Slowly and surely, Cas's grace is expelled from his body by the incantation, as the spell works its magic. The flowing lights shift in the air, swirling as if they have life of their own, twisting and floating, like the way solar winds blow in the space, like the dazzling shape of aurora lights shifting on the firmament. They circle around Cas's body, hesitant about leaving. Then they start moving upward, toward the direction of Heaven.

Dean is already moving toward the impala as he chants the angel exorcism, by the time the last piece of Cas's grace leaves his body, he has the car trunk wide open, the bowl with mixture of ingredients for the angel summoning spell setting on the drawing is pre-prepared and ready to go. He throws the lighter into the bowl, watching the flame jumps high around the mixture.

Outside, Cas's grace starts moving back, lowering from the sky.

Dean holds his breath and waits. Part of his brain never stops wandering off, panicking about what if the summoning doesn't work and Cas's grace ends up at the door of the Heaven, where other angels spot him and kill him again. He doesn't realize he starts praying again, just repeatedly thinking, *Please, Cas. Please, work. Please, come back.*

As Cas's grace flies away and hovers back, his body collapses down as if a mountain falls. Without control of a living mind, the legs slump, the body drops, the arms limp, the shoulder crashes. The ground shakes like an earthquake. The sound of avalanche.

Dean is startled, he is petrified. Dean only belatedly realizes he forgets to consider how to prevent this giant body from hitting the ground hard, from being hurt by the collision. Though, with his tiny shape, he doubts there is anything he could have done. He hates the thought that Cas's form might be injured in the process by the slightest because of his carelessness. *Please.* He can only hope.

The only fortunate thing is, this is Alaska. For miles, there is no human sighting. No one will ever get to witness, no one will get collateral damage.

Dean runs toward where the giant body lies. Where the Chrysler Tower falls to the ground. The sight of the landfall and avalanche of Castiel.

There is something else he realizes not working as expected. The body is still too big -- as it was. Somehow in his thought, in his plan, he imagines it shrink back to the normal size the moment the angelic parts are separated, somehow things will correct themselves and problems get solved automatically -- they never do.

And now, with the grace hovering over the lifeless body that is still too giant, the problem remains.

Dean forces himself to think fast. He looks at the cloud of the light, as if looking into Cas's eyes. He can feel his own brain operating like a computer with too hot CPU, dizzy from the light and too hard thinking.

"Okay, emm, okay, we just need to, ugh," Dean puts a hand on the edge of the giant trench coat that is now spread on the ground. And as far as he reaches, he can only put a palm on the corner, no further than the first edge stitch. *He's too tiny, too weak, too helpless.* The shape and size keep reminding him. *He's just a human. How can he ever imagine fixing an angel that is so grand and beautiful?*

Dean clenches his fingers around that corner of the fabric he can get, forcing his mind away from that train of thought. *This is about Cas, not about him.*

The lights float closer to him than to the body on the ground, but still high in the air, out of reach.

Dean feels he can almost imagine Castiel's frown and tilted head from the way the grace hover around him. Pending, nowhere to go. Homeless. Bodyless.

"We need to get you a body first."

The thought comes like a flash, so is the answer. This is actually an obvious answer. An easy one, too easy. A permission freely given.

"Yes." Dean says quickly, seeking the light of Cas's grace. "Cas, I said yes."

The grace floats toward him, circling around his body, inches away, but doesn't move into him like he expects it to be. It's almost like Cas is considering, hesitating, refusing.

"You'll never hurt me, I promise." Dean looks at the grace, knowing his thought. "I trust you." He reaches a hand, and touches the grace, finding it warm and soft, like a feather's touch.

The light reacts to his touch instantly, twining on his fingers, then moving along his skin on the arm until it reaches his mouth. It swarms into him.

The sensation of being possessed isn't exactly welcoming. It's like intrusion, a forest fire burning its way down the throat, an explosion of light and thunder through the vein, and his body panics automatically, his muscles tense. His body tries to reject the outsider even if his brain demands otherwise. Dean forces his mind focused on the only thought he can think of: *This is Cas. This is Cas. This is Cas.* And his heartbeat slowly calms.

The view of the world brightens up when all the grace infuses into him, it's like setting the brightness and contrast level of a TV display to a thousand and more. Everything so dazzling and blinding, covered by glinting stars, Dean thinks his eyes might hurt from looking at the world like this for too long, but then quickly realizes the eyes are actually quite used to it -- the eyes that are not entirely his own right now. *Is this the view of the world in Cas's eyes?*

"Cas?" Dean's mouth whispers, tentatively, toward the empty road ahead of him. Cas's body is still slumping on the ground, but this is not what he means.

Inside of him, the stir of another existence emerges. Dean closes his eyes, searching inside.

At the corner of his head, he finds him. Cas looks exactly the same as he remembers him by, the trench coat, the blue tie, the disheveled hair, the bright blue eyes. No rings though, and no wings. Human like. Comfortable and easy to look.

Cas stands there, still and quiet, in the corner of Dean's mind, as if trying to keep his existence as small as possible, like a shy kid hiding himself at the very end of the room at the prom, trying to make himself unnoticeable.

This corner of Dean's mind looks like Bobby's living room while it's still standing. The place closest to home. And Cas is here.

Dean rushes to him, "There you are."

For all his concern, Cas looks well. In this current form as he is, whatever that form is called when he is just a cloud of light inside his mind. He looks a little tired, and a little -- a lot -- worried, with the tight burrow between his eyebrows. But all things considered, he looks fine.

Dean spreads his arms and pulls Cas into a hug. His brain produces the sensation of warmth and solidness of a body for him, even if he knows nothing is physical now.

Cas reluctantly raises his arms and wraps them around Dean. Then he doesn't let go. Nor does Dean.

"Hello, Dean." He says, in his gravel voice.

Dean exhales a happy huff, realizes he can't even begin to tell him how much he misses this voice, among everything else.

"Hey, Cas." He says, over his shoulder.

They separate, after however long, each taking half a step back, still standing too close, eyes still holding. In this corner of the mind -- this memory or imagination or whatever -- sunshine cast through the window, leaving long lazy shadow on the soft fuzzy carpet on the living room floor. Dean can almost pretend it's just a comfortable afternoon in a lazy normal day. Everything warm and hazy. They can curl on the sofa and watch TV for hours, take a small nap if they doze off. And Bobby or Sam would call them for dinner.

Dean smiles.

But Cas's frown does not unwind.

"You shouldn't do this." Cas says, his eyes almost like reproachful, but it really just is all condensed concerns. And Dean knows.

"Yeah, heard it before, kinda have a name for bad at doing what I should do by now, ain't I?" Dean grins. The kind of grin that creates a shallow dimple on his cheek.

Cas sighs, and says, quietly, whole-heartedly. "Thank you."

Dean answers with a nod and a smile, "Don't mention it."

He pats Cas on the shoulder. The touch is still warm and solid. Real.
