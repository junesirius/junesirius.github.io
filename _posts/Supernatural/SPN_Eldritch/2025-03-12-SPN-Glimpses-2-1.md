He takes two days driving from Colorado to Louisiana, another two days from Louisiana to Michigan.

Dean can't help touching the piece of trench coat in his pocket, as if it's heating up, burning on the skin where his own heart beats. But it's just some clothes.

The leaves of the trees grow wider and larger as he goes south, then thinner and taller again as he heads north.

The laptop search bar has a new frequent search words: "giant monster". It turns out people online tend to report even more witnesses of something huge and monstrous than that of holy or hellish.

Dean picks the roads no one walks or drives, the roads in between trees and deep in the mountains. The mountains where legends say giant monsters and pre-history creature lives.

He runs into a lone vampire making a living hunting bears, and a goat-masked creature living in the woods that turns out to be a fairy. But not another "yeti" or "bigfoot", certainly no mention at all of any creature with trench coat-colored skin.

The snow starts melting by the road of the Midwest and Lake area. It's been months since Colorado, even longer since Purgatory. Leviathans fade into memory of a previous life, demons and Apocalypses are like stories that other people tell.

Once, in the middle of the night, on his way driving to Montana, Dean finds himself wondering, if this is gonna be the rest of his life. Drifting on the road, searching, alone, not even hunting, not really. Just looking, finding, going after the angel that he lost.

He ponders, what if the next time he sees him is twenty years from now, what if Cas gets pulled away soon after that again, and the next time is fifty years later. Or a hundred. What then?

Hours condense in the nights like this, moving slowly, minutes by minutes. But days and weeks flash by quick.

He has no answer. So he pushes the questions away. He could think of nothing but finding Cas when he was in Purgatory, and it is no different now. Even if it's going to take the rest of his life.

He wasn't planning on coming back to the life on Earth anyway, back there, before he found Cas. Then he found him.

So here, now, on the Earth. It has to be easier. It has to.

The road stretches ahead like used tapes roiling back in a cassette player, miles and miles putting behind the wheels.

Cas is not in Montana, either. But he does run into more gods and titans. Zeus and Prometheus die in the same day, and he gets to meet with Artemis, the goddess of his occupation, supposedly the protector of all hunters. It isn't the worst day of his life, all things considered.

That is when Artemis tells him the legend of one giant ancient bird. After he asked nicely.

"There is this giant fish, born in the northern sea, the head to tail stretching thousands of miles long. It turns into a giant bird, no one knows how big it is, must be tens of thousands of miles wide. When it flies, its wings spread like the clouds covering the sky. When the winter stirs the sea, it flies to south. Its wings flap on the water, the sea lifts waves of three thousand miles high. It flies upwards, the swirl of its body creates tornados from ninety thousand miles high in the sky. The wind and air is its breath, the blue in the sky the color of its feathers. Ancient Greek and Chinese all have records of it from thousands of years ago. Is this the giant ancient creature that you're looking for?"

Dean swallows, thinking about the shadow of Castiel's wings on the barn walls the first day they met. "Maybe," he says. "Does this bird has a name?"

"Greeks and Egyptians call it Phoenix, Chinese call it Peng, archeologists call it Archaeopteryx, you're calling it Angel already. Does the name matter?"

Dean shakes his head, dumbly. "And where does it -- he, they -- live and rest? This northern sea it born from and the southern place it flies to, where are they?"

"It only rests on the oldest and tallest tree, thriving from the age of glacier and dinosaurs, taking eight thousand years as spring, and eight thousand more for autumn."

Dean blinks, blankly.

Artemis lets out a short sigh. "Redwood, California."

"Thank you!" Dean blurts out, "Next time, start with that! Now I can see why Greeks have Minotaur and Sphinx."
