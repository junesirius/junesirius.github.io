He spends two days driving from Colorado to Louisiana, another two days from Louisiana to Michigan.

Dean can't help touching the piece of trench coat fragment in his pocket, as if it's heating up, burning against the skin where his heart beats. But it's just a piece of clothing.

The leaves of the trees grow wider and larger as he goes south, then thinner and taller again as he heads north.

The laptop search bar has a new frequent search term: "giant monster." It turns out people online are even more likely to report sightings of something huge and monstrous than something holy or hellish.

Dean picks the roads no one walks or drives, the roads in between trees and deep in the mountains. The mountains where legends say giant monsters and prehistoric creatures live.

He runs into a lone vampire making a living hunting bears, and a fairy living in the woods with a goat mask. But no more "yeti" or "bigfoot," and certainly no mention at all of any creature with trench coat-colored skin.

The snow starts melting by the roads of the Midwest and Great Lakes. It's been months since Rocky Mountain, even longer since Purgatory. Leviathans fade into the memory of a previous life, demons and Apocalypses are like stories told by other people.

Once, in the middle of the night, on his way to Montana, Dean finds himself wondering, if this is gonna be the rest of his life. Drifting on the road, searching, alone, not even hunting, not really. Just looking, finding, going after the angel he lost.

"Cas, what if the next time I find you is twenty years from now?" He ponders aloud, half speaking to himself, half praying, if this can still be called prayer. "What if you get pulled away again after that, and the next after is fifty years later. Or a hundred. What then?"

"I might end up in a trench somewhere one day, become some bones. Then who'll continue looking for you, to bring you home?"

Hours condense in nights like this, moving slowly, minute by minute. Words coagulate. But days and weeks flash by.

He has no answer. So he pushes the questions away. He could think of nothing but finding Cas when he was in Purgatory, and it is no different now. Even if it's going to take the rest of his life.

He hadn't planned on coming back to life on Earth anyway, back there, before he found Cas. Until he found him.

So here, now, on the Earth. It has to be easier. It has to be.

The road stretches ahead like used tapes rolling back in a cassette player, miles and miles left behind the wheels.

Cas is not in Montana, either. But he does run into more gods and such. Zeus and Prometheus die on the same day, and he gets to meet Artemis, the goddess of his occupation, supposedly the protector of all hunters. It isn't the worst day of his life, all things considered.

That is when Artemis tells him the legend of one giant ancient bird. After he asked nicely.

"There is this giant fish, born in the northern sea, its head to tail stretching thousands of miles. It turns into a giant bird, no one knows how big it is, must be tens of thousands of miles wide. When it flies, its wings spread like clouds covering the sky. When winter stirs the sea, it flies south. Its wings flap on the water, and the sea lifts waves three thousand miles high. It flies upwards, the swirl of its body creating tornados ninety thousand miles high in the sky. The wind and air are its breath, the blue in the sky the color of its feathers. The ancient Greeks and Chinese both had records of it thousands of years ago. Is this the ancient creature you're looking for?"

Dean swallows, thinking about the shadow of Castiel's wings on the barn walls the first day they met. "Maybe," he says. "Does this bird have a name?"

"Greeks and Egyptians call it Phoenix, Chinese call it Peng, archeologists call it Archaeopteryx, you're calling it Angel already. Does the name matter?"

Dean shakes his head, dumbly. "And where does it -- he, they -- live and rest? This northern sea it was born from, and the southern place it flies to, where are they?"

"It only rests on the oldest and tallest tree, thriving since the age of glaciers and dinosaurs, taking eight thousand years as spring, and eight thousand more for autumn."

Dean blinks blankly.

Artemis lets out a short sigh. "Redwood, California."

"Thank you!" Dean blurts out, "Next time, start with that! Now I can see why the Greeks have Minotaurs and Sphinxes."
