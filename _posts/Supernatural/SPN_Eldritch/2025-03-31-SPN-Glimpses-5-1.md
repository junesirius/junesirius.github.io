All the eyes on all the rings blink at the same time. So does the one on the giant human-shaped body, shining white light from its pupils.

Dean is shaken out of his freeze by the piercing lines of sight coming from all directions. His breath hitches, his knees give way. His body can't hold still, he takes a step back in shock.

He looks up, neck sore from the crooked angle. He stares into the pair of eyes on Cas's face. The light is too dazzling and bright to see, it makes his eyes hurt, but he holds the gaze. The color and light of the aurora borealis that had seemed so astonishing, pales behind Cas in comparison.

The eyes of Castiel's true form follow Dean's movement. As he takes the step back, they shift to follow him, then blink slowly. Cas lifts a foot and mirrors his motion, taking a slow step back just like Dean did. A step closer to the tear in the air.

"No!" Dean finds his voice again, shaky and broken, but it comes out like a scream. Panic rises. His legs are heavy like lead, but he forces them to move, dragging one up and throwing the other back down. He stumbles toward the misshaped form of Castiel.

Castiel stops where he stands. The spinning of the rings slows. Still all-eyes staring.

Dean swallows under the weight of the eyes. Too many, too odd-shaped, too out of place, too un-human. Alien and strange. He bites the inside of his cheek, blinks hard to chase away the crawling unease, to sooth the creeping goosebumps. He has to remind his own brain to bear the eyes without flinch, to press down the instinct of running away. *This is Cas. Cas is not weird. Cas is not dangerous. This is Cas.* He forces his steps forward, toward where Cas stands. His legs are still feeble from the shock.

"You are, afraid of me." Castiel says, slowly, testing the sound and volume. It is still so much louder than a human voice, but not as deafening as the angel's true voice. And it is a statement, an observation, not a question.

"No!" Dean is still shaky, each step wobbly, but he almost reaches right in front of Cas now, right at his feet. And he realizes, the distance has made the size and shape deceivable, the perception skewed even if just for several feet. Now that he can almost touches this form of Cas's, Dean finds out, even if he reaches as tall as he can, he could barely touch anywhere above the heel of Cas's shoes. He stands there, looking up, wondering if it's how ant's view of a human would be like. He remembers looking up at the Statue of Liberty from its base, that one time they visited New York when he was young.

"Yes," Dean hesitates, allowing himself to admit, feeling the aftershock still hanging around his limbs. He answers carefully, voice tight, full of awe. "But not the way you think."

"Tell me," Cas says, in a pained voice, the light in his eyes dimming. The voice that says without saying: *Tell me how horrifying and dangerous I am now, tell me how distorted and undignified this shape is. Tell me I am a monster. Tell me your disgust and terror, your hatred and unforgiveness, and that you'll leave me between the dimensions as I was. The place I deserved to be.*

And Dean tells him, through a choked sound, "It's beautiful, Cas. You're beautiful. Awesome, really. In any form, in all the forms." He pauses, letting the words sink in, because it's the truth. In the place where his stomach twists with unease, there are also flutters. Then, the bigger truth: "I'm not afraid of you, Cas. I never will be. I'm afraid of losing you."

The lingering touch of the Cas in the djinn's version of Purgatory comes back to him. So do those wide blue eyes filled with the glistening tears when he said, "You have to let me go." Dean can't help wiping his face with his hand, finding the barely dried places wet again. It feels so easy to admit it, to say it now, as if he has practiced it a thousand times -- with the djinn world and his nightmares being rehearsals, that might as well be true.

And just like the nightmare replay, Cas sighs heavily, and then says, "But you have to let me go. Me being here, my existence and the tear, it's breaking the dimension, it might break the sky and the whole world. I don't want to hurt you. I would never hurt you."

He glances at the sky. The lights of the aurora borealis intensify into more powerful glaring lights. The sky is almost bright now, not like daylight, but with the flowing curtains of aurora, mixed from green, blue, and red. The colors shift rapidly and violently, the whole sky is like a boiling cauldron with a swirling mix of mysterious colors from witch's potions.

"I know, Cas, I know!" Dean yells at the top of his volume. "But I have a way."

<br>

"No, this is too dangerous." Cas snaps, once Dean finishes telling him the plan, the part about expelling him then quickly summoning him back.

"I know, I'll have to time it right or you'll be... hurt, but I'll keep both hands on the wheel, alright? Just have some faith in me, I'll do it right." Dean says. He knows "hurt" is too mild a word, but he tries not to think about what if he messes it all up and ends up making everything even worse than it is. He can't think about that now.

"I always have faith in you, Dean. But no, I mean dangerous to you," Cas clarifies in eagerness, "I don't care what happens to me, but you, Dean, you'll be in danger."

Dean blinks, then he looks up at the sky and remembers. The dazzling light and the electric-charged air. The infinity that leaks from the tear and endangers the reality. The rule of dimension and the laws of physics that could kill him as easily as a snap.

"I won't be able to protect you during that process," Cas finishes, in a voice that is quieter but no less firm.

"What about, for once, make it my turn to protect you?" Dean says, just as quiet, just as insistent and stubborn.

Cas falls silent. He bends the body, lowering a hand, making an attempt as if he wants to reach a finger to touch Dean, but then remembers his size. Even his smallest finger is larger than Dean's whole body, so the movement is paused in the middle.

He sighs again.

"What about the tear?" Cas asks, pulling his hand back to his side where it belongs. "Even if you can separate my form and fix me, there is still the tear of the dimension that needs fixing."

Dean shifts uneasily. "We'll handle that later." His grip on the demon blade tightens automatically, hidden behind his back.

The eyes on Castiel's rings scrutinize him closely from all angles. Dean has the weird feeling of being observed and researched under a microscope, that even his smallest movement won't escape these many eyes. The feeling of being seen through all the way straight to his soul, his mind. His heart sinks, knowing exactly what Cas would say if he knew the whole picture of his plan.

And Cas starts, "The divide between dimensions is the thinnest when you pray the hardest. And every time you're dying, your feelings and thoughts are so strong they tear the dimensions apart, that's how I get through."

Dean opens his mouth, trying to object. But Cas doesn't let him.

"That's why I reached to you in the snowstorm on Rocky Mountain, why I found you in the redwoods of California. You were dying, both times, then."

There is a pause. A question hanging on Cas's lips. Dean realizes, Cas doesn't want to ask as much as Dean doesn't want to answer.

He is not dying this time. Not immediately from any source of danger in the outside world anyway. But from... His fingers twitch around the blade's handle. The carving patterns on the handle are getting imprinted into his palm by being gripped too tightly.

"Are you planning to sacrifice yourself to save me, Dean?" Cas asks, at long last.

Dean finds his chest too clenched to answer. He can't bring himself to tell the truth, but he can't lie to him, either. So he just stills, desperate for an answer that doesn't exist.

But the silence is the answer of its own.

Cas probably doesn't even need that confirmation to know. "I won't let you die," He tells him, as a statement of fact. "Not for me. Not again."

"But I have to," Dean blurts out, desperate. That's the only thing he can think to say. "I have to."

*That's his job. No, not because that's his job.* Dean frantically corrects his own mind. *That's because it's Cas.* He doesn't need another reason.

"Why? I don't deserve it," Cas says, voice sad and tired, more tired than Dean's ever seen him. "What's the point of living if I can't fix the things I broke?" What "the things" are, he doesn't say. He doesn't need to. The world that is torn, the lives that are lost, some heart that is broken, some trust that is lost, some bond that is always, forever, it seems, fractured.

Cas begins to step back again, the edges of the tear of the dimension starts brightening up. His steps don't seem voluntary, it's more like he's being absorbed backward by a vortex than walking on his own, and he is too tired to resist. His wings hang low, exhausted and heavy.

"This way, at least I can close the tear, using my own body. A fitting punishment and redemption." Cas is yards away from Dean now, and no more than one step away from the tear. "Just, take care of yourself, Dean."

It's a debate neither of them can win or ever convince the other. Isn't it always the ultimate Winchester debate in the face of every single godforsaken world-ending event? Dean knows it far too well by now, so he doesn't bother with it anymore.

"Cas." He calls the angel, holding the stare one last time, as determined as he can be. The decision is already made.

"*Omnipotentis Dei potestatem invoco! Ab orbe terra...*" Dean starts, just as Castiel is about to take that final step.
