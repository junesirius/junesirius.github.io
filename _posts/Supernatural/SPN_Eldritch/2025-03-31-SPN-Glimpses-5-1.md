All the eyes on all the rings blink at the same time. So does the one on the giant human-shaped body, shining white lights in the pupil.

Dean is shaken out of the freeze by the piercing lines of eye sight coming from all directions. His breath hitches, his knees give way. His body can't hold still, he takes a step back.

He looks up, his neck sore from crooked angle. He looks into the pair of eyes on Cas's face, the lights are too dazzling and bright to see, they make his eyes hurt, but he holds the gaze. The color and light of aurora borealis that he thinks was astonishing behind Cas loses their attraction in comparison.

The eyes of Castiel's true form follow Dean's move. As he takes the step back, they move to follow him, then blink slowly. Cas lifts a foot up, also takes a slow step back, mimicking his move. A step closer to the opening tear.

"No!" Dean finds his voice again, shaky and broken, but comes out like a scream. Panic rises. His legs are heavy like lead, but he manages to pull them up, and throws them back down. He runs toward the misshaped form of Castiel.

Castiel stops where he stands. The spinning speed of the rings slows down. Still all-eyes staring.

Dean swallows at the weight of the eyes. Too many, too odd-shaped, too out of place, too un-human. He bites his cheeks, he blinks hard to chase away the uneasiness. He has to remind his own brain to bear the eyes without flinch, pressing down the urge of running away. *This is Cas. Cas is not weird. Cas is not dangerous. This is Cas.* He forces his steps toward where Cas stands. His legs are still feeble from the shock.

"You are, afraid of me." Castiel says, slowly, testing the sound and volume. It is still so much louder than human voice, but not as deafening as angel's true voice. And it is a statement, an observation, not a question.

"No!" Dean is still shaky, each step wobbly, but he almost reaches right in front of Cas now, right at his foot. And he realizes, the distance has made the size and shape deceivable, even if just for several feet. Now that he can almost touches this form of Cas's, Dean finds out, even if he reaches as tall as he can, he can barely touch anywhere above the heel of Cas's shoes. He stands there, looking up, thinking if it's how ant's view of a human would be like. He remembers looking up at the Statue of Liberty from its foot, that one time they visited New York when he was young.

"Yes," Dean hesitates, allowing himself to admit, feeling the aftershock still hanging around his limbs. He answers carefully, voice tight, in awe. "But not what you think."

"Tell me." Cas says, in pained voice, the light in his eyes dimming. The voice that says without saying: *Tell me how horrifying and dangerous I am now, tell me how distorted and undignified this shape is. Tell me I am a monster. Tell me your disgust and terror, your hatred and unforgiveness, and you'll leave me in between the dimensions as I was.*

And Dean tells him, through choked sound: "It's beautiful, Cas. You're beautiful. Awesome, really. In any form, in all the forms." He pauses, letting the words sink in, because it's the truth. In the place where his stomach twists in uneasiness, there are also flutters. Then, the bigger truth, "I'm not afraid of you, Cas. I never will. I'm afraid of losing you."

The lingering touch of the Cas in the djinn's version of Purgatory comes back to him. So is that pair of widened blue eyes with the glistening tears when he said "You have to let me go." Dean can't help wipe his face with his hands, finding the barely dried places wet again. It feels so easy to admit it, to say it now, as if he has practiced for a thousand times -- with the djinn world and his nightmares being rehearsals, that might as well be true.

And just like the nightmare replay, Cas sighs heavily, and then says, "But you have to let me go. Me being here, my existence and the tear, it's breaking the dimension, it might break the sky and the whole world. I don't want to hurt you. I will never hurt you."

He glances at the sky. The lights of the aurora borealis intensify into more powerful glaring lights. The sky is almost bright now, but not like the day-time bright, it is from the flowing curtain-shaped aurora, mixed from green, blue, and red. The colors transit fast and violently, the whole sky is like a boiling cauldron with floating mysterious colors of witch's potions.

"I know, Cas, I know!" Dean yells from the top of his volume. "But I have a way."

<br>

"No, this is too dangerous." Cas snaps, once Dean finished telling him the plan, the part about expelling him then quickly summoning him back.

"I know, I'll have to time it right or you'll be... hurt, but I'll keep both hands on the wheel, alright? Give me some faith, I'll do it right." Dean says. He knows "hurt" would be a too light word, but he tries not to think about what if he messes it all up and ends up making everything even worse than it is. He can't think about that now.

"I always have faith in you, Dean. But no, I mean dangerous to you." Cas clarifies in eager, "I don't care what happens to me, but you, Dean, you'll be in danger."

Dean blinks, then he looks up at the sky and remembers. The dazzling light and the charged-up electrical air. The infinity that seeps through the tear and endangers the reality. The rule of dimension and rule of physics that can kill him as easily as a snap.

"I won't be able to protect you in that process." Cas finishes, in a voice that is quieter but no less firm.

"What about, for once, make it my turn to protect you?" Dean says, also quieter, but as insistent and stubborn as he can.

Cas falls silent. He bends the body, lowering down the hand, making an attempt as if he wants to reach a finger to touch Dean, but then he remembers his size. Even his smallest finger is larger than Dean's whole body, so the movement is paused in the middle.

He sighs again.

"What about the tear?" Cas asks, moving his hand back to the side of his body, where it belongs. "Even if you can separate my form and fix me, there is still the tear of the dimension that needs fix."

Dean shifts uneasily. "We'll handle that later." His grip on the demon blade tightens automatically, hiding behind his back.

The eyes on Castiel's rings scrutinize him closely from all angles. Dean has the weird feeling of being observed and researched under a microscope, that even his smallest movement won't escape these many eyes. The feeling of being seen through all the way into the soul, inside his mind. His heart sinks, knowing exactly what Cas would say if he knows the whole picture of his plan.

And Cas starts saying, "The divide between the dimension is the thinnest when you pray the hardest. And every time when you're dying, the feelings and thoughts are so strong that they tear the dimensions apart, that's how I can get through."

Dean opens his mouth, trying to comment. But Cas doesn't let him.

"That's why I could come to you in the snow storm on Rocky Mountain, what's why I found you in the redwoods in California. You were dying, both times, then."

There is a pause. A question hanging on Cas's lips. Dean realizes, Cas doesn't want to ask as much as Dean doesn't want to answer.

He is not dying this time. Not immediately from the source of danger from the outside world anyway. But from... His fingers twitch around the handle of the blade. The pattern of the carving on the handle is getting imprinted into his palm by being gripped too tight.

"Are you planning to sacrifice yourself to save me, Dean?" Cas asks, finally.

Dean finds his chest too clenched to answer. He can't tell him the truth, but he can't lie to him, either. So he just stills, thinking desperately for an answer that doesn't exist.

But the silence is the answer of its own.

Cas probably doesn't even need that confirmation to know. "I won't let you die." He tells him, as a fact. "Not for me. Not again."

"But I have to." Dean blurts out, desperate. That's the only thing he can think of saying. "I have to."

*That's his job. No, not because that's his job.* Dean frantically corrects his own mind. *That's because it's Cas.* He doesn't need another reason.

"Why? I don't deserve it." Cas says, voice sad and tired, more tired than he ever seen him. "What's the point of living if I can't fix the things that I broke?" He starts to step back again, the edges of the tear of the dimension starts brightening up. His steps don't seem to be voluntary, it's more like he's been absorbing backward by a vortex than walking on his own. His wings drop down as they are worn out from exhaustion.

"This way, at least I can close the tear, using my own body." Cas is three steps away from Dean now, and no more than one step away from the tear. "Just, take care of yourself, Dean."

It's a debate neither of them can win or ever persuade the other. Isn't it the ultimate Winchester's debate in the face of every single world-ending event? Dean knows far too well, so he doesn't bother with it anymore.

"Cas." He calls the angel, holding the stare one last time, as determined as he can be. The decision is already made.

"*Omnipotentis Dei potestatem invoco!*" Dean starts, just as Castiel about to take the last step.
