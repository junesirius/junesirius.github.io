"Thank you for saving me." Cas says, once they finally pull apart.

"Any time." Dean grins, "You can thank me when we get you back into your body. Then we can do this properly."

They almost forget they're still only half-way done.

And the world is probably still on the edge of ending.

"We settled all the pieces?" Dean checks on Cas, "Everything inside and outside, angel and human? Fixed everything?"

Cas nods. "I think so."

There is still a small sound deep down somewhere humming something depressing, if they have to guess, the shitty things never really go away for good, especially when the things they really want to get rid of is just a thought that takes root. They can't even really tell whose it is, maybe both. Dean knows well enough, and can sense it like a stubborn dark shade in the corner of the whole palette of the thoughts. But at least that hasn't formed into a full sentence of thought yet, so Dean considers it acceptable for now. Cas agrees quietly.

They shift the attention back to the outside. Reality sinks back in.

Dean checks on Cas's body immediately. The lights and flowing grace have been more dazzling than ever. The whole ground where the giant body once occupied is like a field made of light and energy. In the center of all the light, Dean is kneeling besides Cas's body, hands held together. The body -- Cas's body, made of flesh and blood like any human -- is returned to the normal human size now.

The buzzing sound of the charged air is louder than ever, the electricity in the air makes all hairs stand. Any friction feels like able to trigger a spark. Dean spares split of a second glancing at the tear in the space and the crazily darting aurora lights in the sky. The Earth feels like on the edge of overcharging and about to explode and burn like the Sun at any minute. Dean returns the attention back to Cas, hoping they still have at least a minute or two.

Dean separates their hands, lights stop pouring out from him, the ones already out there still surround the body. He regards the face of the body, the closed eyes, the crumpled coat. The body looks just like an empty shell, a doll, there is no expression on that face, no similarity to a life. Nothing like a man sleeping, more like a house with no one inside. He shifts uneasily.

"Want to try the first ride now?" Dean asks, trying to hide the nervousness.

*Honestly, not really. I'm spoiled in here.* Cas stretches mentally, his grace already start unfurling as he sends the last thought.

"I know, buddy. That's on me." Dean can't help chuckling, the worry dies down slightly.

He squeezed Cas's hand in the mental image one last time, and reluctantly lets his hand slip. Cas puts his palms on Dean's cheek, touching one last time, then stands up from the sofa. Then his human form turns into three spinning rings with three pairs of wings, covered by bright silvery blue lights. Dean watches the light fly up, out of his mind's eyes.

The warm sensation of Cas's grace dancing around his soul lingers just one moment longer, then Cas flies out. Dean watches the light flowing out of his mouth, moving into the vessel's, already missing the company inside the head. That corner of the brain where Cas occupied, the side of the sofa where the sunshine doesn't reach, that spot feels too empty now.

Dean pushes down the bubbling sense of emptiness, forcing the attention onto the body, onto Cas.

The new swarm of light has all flowed inside the body, Dean assumes that means Cas with all his existence has moved into the new home now. He reaches back for Cas's hand, waiting for a twitch in the fingers or a blink of eyes, anything.

Dean holds his breath waiting, until his body protests. He resumes the breath, sharp and uneven, Cas's body still doesn't show any sign of life. No chest rising falling, no breath, no heartbeat, no pulse.

*You miss the timing, you're stuck with a corpse.* That was what Meg has warned him.

"No, no, no, Cas! Wake up, buddy." Dean starts panicking, he pats Cas's face, shaking his shoulder. His voice shuddered and broken. "What did I do wrong? Don't do this to me, Cas."

He doesn't hear Cas's answer, only the louder and louder sound of electricity blending together from all directions, like biggest thunders the world has ever seen.

After Cas leaves, the view and all senses return to the human level, dumbed and limited, but he has pretty good guesses of what's happening. The sky is boiling with colors, all the red and purple and green dancing relentlessly, merging and separating, forming shapes beyond imagination. The whole sky looks like it's going to tear open an entrance to the universe and pour everything down through the hole, just to make more space to host more of the colors and lights. The plasmas must be reaching some extreme threshold now. His heart drops to the lowest abyss.

"Can't believe it's still gonna end like this." Dean murmurs bitterly, letting go of Cas's hand, fumbling on the ground for the demon blade he dropped earlier, turning to face the tear of the space.

*Right when he thought he could have what he wanted for once, everything is gonna go to wreck again. Classic.* Dean almost laughs, at his own naiveness that things will just be fine, at the joke the world and fate throws on him.

"Here goes nothing." Dean grits his teeth, aiming the tip of the blade at his heart, closing his eyes. "*Death is an infinite vessel.*"

His hands start adding force onto the hold of the blade, but the expected piercing pain through the chest does not come. Instead, he feels his wrists are gripped tight, and a gravel voice growls, "Dean."

Dean snaps open his eyes. There he is. Cas. Beautiful, glaring, bright, furious. He snatches the blade from Dean's hand, Dean can't find strength to resist. He can only throw the arms around Cas and hold him tight, breathing out shakily. "Thank God, Cas. I thought it didn't work."

"It took longer than I expected to settle everything down in here. But I did not expect to see I'm almost too late *again* the minute I come back." Cas still sounds pissed.

"Oh that," Dean pulls back from the hug, rubbing his nose, looking like a child caught stealing from piggy bank.

"Yes, that! Thought we're over this self-sacrifice-to-save-the-world routine." Cas snaps.

"You have a better idea fixing that? 'Cause I don't really want to condemn the world again." Dean challenges.

"Actually, I do, I just didn't think it's something I could have until very recently."

Dean raises eyebrows waiting for an elaboration.

Cas glances at the lights that are still hanging around on the ground, giant-body shaped, as if the phantom giant still hasn't left, then at the tear, then back to Dean.

"It needs energy to fuel the patch, then needs something infinite to actually close it." Cas starts, Dean nods, half understanding, half encouraging in anticipation.

"Angel grace is a lot of energy as a good starting point," he pauses, and levels Dean a look. "And I supplied it with millions of years of knowledge and memory I had for the last two times. It's not infinite, but with all the things I saw and I knew, all the history of universe from the beginning of the time, all the people I witnessed and memorized, all the emotions I felt. Everything in my brain, it was enough to keep the tears closed for long enough until you're safe. That was my initial plan for this time too."

Dean makes a gesture as if he's going to argue, but Cas presses his hand down, just continues. "But now we have something better, so much better. We have the free energy," he gestures to the residue light on the ground, "the energy converted from the disappearing mass from the shrinking body, the beautiful physics rule of Mass-Energy Conversion. I have to admit even I forgot to take it into account."

"And the infinite thing?"

"You see, Dean. Death is not the only infinite thing, and there is this other thing, so much more abundant and tremendous than the past, so easy to forget the potential -- the future." Cas squeezes Dean's hands, pulling him closer, almost talking directly into his breath. Dean can't tear his eyes away from the Angel. "The future is limitless, countless, endless. With you, between us, now there are infinite possibilities of where the future can go. The *possibilities* of what the whole world can become because of us, that is superfluous even for a different dimension."

"Wow," Dean gasps, truly amused, heartquaken. *That is the hottest thing I've ever heard of. Poetic, too.*

He looks at Cas, almost expecting he picks up his thought already. Then he remembers they are not sharing body anymore. So instead, he sends the message through prayer.

Cas smiles. "Yes, it is indeed very poe..."

Dean doesn't let him finish, he can't wait anymore, already pulling him in to close the very small remaining distance, and presses his lips on the opened ones of Castiel's.

He feels the dry and chapped lips, the warm and soft sensation, Cas's hands in his hair, his in Cas's. The sensations he misses when they were both in his head. Guess brain just can't imagine everything, and this, this is so much better.

And he can't wait to see the infinite possibilities of the future, like Cas says, given that the world doesn't end before that. Dean chances a look at the nasty tear of the dimension, the energy converted from the shrunk body mass is flying toward the gap. The edge of the tear starts patching up from bottom to top, like the times he watched Cas's grace snitching them up on the Rocky Mountain and in the Redwoods.

Cas grunts a groan under his lips, complaining about his distraction. Dean makes a chuckling sound in his throat, putting his full attention back to Cas, ignoring the world now.

Cas's body is warm and solid in his touch, his tongue soft and gentle, his dark hairs intertwined with his fingers, reminding Dean of the time when his fingers were winded up with Cas's astonishingly beautiful starry-black wings and feathers. He tastes the clean earthy taste in Cas's mouth, reminded of the wet fresh air after a hot summer afternoon downpour. He feels the vibration from his heartbeat through the skin, he hears his small moaning sound in the throat. Dean uses all his senses to feel Cas, wondering if he would feel him differently if he could have angelic senses just for a minute for this, if Cas feels him differently.

The world is forgotten at moments like this, all Dean can think of is Cas, and those infinite literally world-saving earth-turning futures ahead of them. And Cas, by the calm happy look on his face, the eyelashes quivering like butterfly's wings, is thinking the same.

The kiss is not broken until way after the world falls silent.

"Listen." Cas manages, after forever. The time must have paused for them, the world must have stopped spinning for them.

Dean pants a little, leaning his forehead on Cas's, tilting his head slightly to do what he asked.

"I don't hear anything." He says. The surrounding is quiet, only the sound of pine leaves shuffling in the light breeze.

"Exactly." Cas smiles.

There is no sound of electricity, no charged air, no prickling feeling on the skin. Just the wind, the leaves, the normal natural sound.

They look up at the sky. The aurora borealis is still displaying on the canopy, but it's returning to what it used to be, what it should be. Quiet colors of red and green taking turns, moving as the blowing wind moves the air. The view is still breath-taking, but no longer earth-shakenly disturbing.

"Think that means the world is not gonna end any time soon?" Dean beams.

Cas nods, happy.

They go back for another peck of kiss, then head toward the impala.

The world moves on, and the infinite future, just start growing from here.

*Death is not the only infinite vessel. So is freedom. So is love.*
