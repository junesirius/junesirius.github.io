Dean parks the car by the road side, sitting behind the wheel for a moment too long, chewing on the words he might need later. The yard with fence and the painted house looks the same as the last time he saw them, years ago.

He checks through the curtained window, wondering if the owner is in the house now.

He raises a hand, the front door opens before he reaches it.

"Dean Winchester." The woman regards him, a small smile showing.

"Missouri." Dean returns the smile, leaning in to give her a hug.

"It's been so long." Her hands pat his back gently, then pulls away. Her eyes are sharp and pointed, but now covered with a knowing, compassionate look. "I'm sorry about the angel."

Dean raises his eyebrows.

"You're just thinking about him," Missouri eases into the room, leading him in. "In fact, I think that is all that you can think about. Am I right?"

Dean swallows, lowering his eyes to the floor, letting his foot lead himself through the place automatically. "Yeah, uh, yeah, he's the reason why I... Sorry I didn't visit earlier."

Missouri puts a cup of coffee in front of him. "Eight years isn't short time, but I understand." She tells him, sitting on the couch at the opposite side across the small coffee table. "Your father sit at that very spot right after that accident, and I told him what he needed to know. How can I help you, Dean?"

Dean's mind wavers for a second by that, old memories of his Dad and Mom and the haunted old house flood back in, but he gives a long exhale and pushes them down. "Cas is not dead," he says, defensive. Not like Mom. And he's not his Dad. "I just need some help to bring him back, that's all."

Missouri nods once, silent, eyes hinting him to continue.

"There was an old friend a few years ago, a really good real-deal psychic." Dean remembers Pamela's bright flirtatious smiles, then the burned-out eye sockets, then bleeding stab wounds in the stomach. He has to force a flinch down. "That was way before we know anything about angels, and she set up this seance, demanding Cas to show. It didn't end well," he swallows again, "but it worked, I think Cas actually showed up and talked to her in some psychic spiritual dimension."

"And you're wondering if I can do something similar and let you talk to Castiel in the same way." Missouri finishes the sentence for him.

Dean nods quietly, "Can you do that?" He tries to not let the desperation and hope seeping all over in his sounds, but Missouri probably knows them all.

She considers, eyes searching his face. And whatever she finds there, it seems to satisfy a question she didn't ask.

"Yes, I suppose." She says, Dean lets out a long breath. "There will be risks, but it is doable. It would be easier if there is something I can use as a medium."

"Medium?" Dean echoes.

"Things from the angel. Things he can identify as his own, guiding his way to the call." Missouri explains.

That rings a bell. Dean automatically touches the handprint on his left shoulder across the jacket, knowing the red mark is still there. Back then, that mark was all they had that has a direct link with the angel, but now, he has more.

Dean reaches into his inner chest pocket, putting the piece of trench coat fabric and blood stained black feather on the table between them, fingers lingering the edge of the feather, not leaving. Both still have the same temperature from his body.

"I have these." He tells Missouri. "Cas left them behind when, emm, last two times we saw each other, right before he disappeared. Would they work?"

Missouri reaches out to touch the cloth, Dean's fingers twitch involuntarily like he has the strongest urge to take it back, to not allow anyone but himself to touch it, to even see it, but he holds the hands where they should be.

"I believe so." Missouri stands up from the couch. Dean follows the action without thinking. The woman eyes his eagerness. "A seance requires certain preparations, I would have said I'd let you know when it's ready, but I think you couldn't stand just sitting here drinking your coffee, so might as well come over and help set it up."

"Yes, Ma'am." Dean nods appreciatedly.

They use the round dining table for the work, Dean watches Missouri paints a pentagon that covers the whole surface, then Enochian symbols and some loosely familiar marks on four ends, with the last end a painted opening eye. Dean looks at it, having a weird feeling it's looking back at him.

"What do those symbols mean?" He can't help asking. Call it occupational habit.

Missouri lights up five candles in the center matching each corner while answering. "The air, the earth, the fire, the water. All the basic elements. And this is your door." She points the eye. "The seance is actually quite simple, the difficult part is to find him and talk to him, if he is willing to show."

"That reminds me, the accident last time, Cas's true form burned that friend of mine's eyes out." Dean admits, a little guiltily, looking at the symbol of the eye again, remembering Pamela's scream and the fire bursting out of her sockets. "Probably don't look at him directly then."

But still, somehow, his mind wanders afar, wondering what it is that Pamela really saw -- a figure as tall as the Chrysler Building like Cas once so casually slipped? A light as bright and burning hot as the sun which is why no human should face him directly? If there has to have one good thing from that blindness, he hopes Pamela at least had the chance to see the most bright and beautiful thing in the whole universe before losing the sight.

"Good to know." Missouri replies, tone flat, "But I'm not going to be the one looking, you are."

"What?"

"I believe he would be more willing to come and talk to you than me." Missouri states, matter-of-fact. "I'll lead the way, and you can have some catch-up."

"How does it work? Some kind of out-of-body spirit-walking experience?" Dean frowns.

"Only your mind will travel." Missouri answers briefly, as if it is enough to understand how the psychics work.

They sit by the table, holding hands. The trench coat fragment in their held hands on Dean's left side, the feather on right.

Missouri closes her eyes. Dean looks at the candle lights briefly until it leaves a jumping flame burn in his view, he closes his eyes as well.

"Castiel, come to us before this circle." Missouri starts, voice slow and steady. "Dean Winchester requests your appearance."

Dean's heart skips a beat at the mention of his own full name. He stares at the blackness behind the eyelid, thinking hard: *Cas, come on. I'm here, where are you?*

Missouri repeats the chanting. Dean prays alongside her voice, as if it's a chanting of his own.

"Castiel, come to us before this circle."

*Cas, come to me, please.*

"Dean Winchester requests your appearance."

*Talk to me, what happened.*

"Castiel, come to us."

*I need you. Please.*

The candle lights in the center of the table start flickering violently. A high-pitch sound starts quiet and distant, increases its volume rapidly as if the source is approaching, is flying closer. The air vibrates. The table shakes violently.

Dean holds his breath.
