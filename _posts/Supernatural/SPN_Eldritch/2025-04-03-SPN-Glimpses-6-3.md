Along with it, the sunshine loses its color and warmth.

"Dean," Cas lowers his eyes. "I really don't --"

Dean shushes him with a finger on his lips. "You can argue all you want later, Cas, but we'll patch you up first, alright? Before anything else, let's fix your body first."

"But that wouldn't be necessary if I need to go back to the dimension in between again." Cas points out.

"*Need to?* You don't freaking *need to* go back that horrible place, Cas!" Dean snaps. "You can just stay here!"

"But that's my responsibility!" Cas snaps too.

"And my responsibility is to keep you alive!" Dean raises his voice.

"And mine is not?" Cas raises his too.

They stare at each other, nose to nose, inches away, falling into sudden silence.

For both of them, one of their hands is clenched into fist in exhaustion, the other... Dean realizes in sudden fascination that he's still holding Cas's hand. And Cas seems to realize at the same moment. He makes a small attempt to pull the hand back, but Dean doesn't let him. So Cas gives up trying.

Dean has the vague gut feeling as if the moment he lets the hand slip, Cas will be gone again. Just like the millions times of the memory replay and nightmare haunting, the moment the palm slip and the weight lightens, Castiel would disappear. It happened in Purgatory, and it feel like it had happened and would happen for so many more times. Dean just can't take more.

His voice hoarse. Cas decidedly keeps his eyes on their hands now, not meeting his eyes.

Dean asks him, gentle, this time, "I only ask this one thing, then, just this one time. But I want you absolutely honest with me, alright, Cas? If you say no, then I'll stop arguing."

He pauses there for a moment, and Cas nods. His eyes drop even lower than where they focus on to. As if the bottom of the sea suddenly sinks, even lower than Mariana Trench, and the color of all the oceans deepens so many degrees that it shows in Castiel's eyes.

And Dean asks him: "Do you *want* to come back? To Earth?" He hesitates for a second, then adds, quieter. "To me?"

*If we can forget what we need to do, forget everything the world and fate and destiny asks, if we can just live for our own and forget about all the consequences, if I choose to stay, will you choose to stay too? Will you come back, to the place I am?*

Dean breathes shallowly. He almost forgets to breathe. He doesn't know whether he should keep his eyes on Cas's lowered eyes where he can only see the flickering eyelashes, or on his fingers. He squeezes the fingers slightly. *Please, be honest. Please, come to me.*

And Cas looks up. He says, agonizingly, "Yes. More than anything. But --"

Dean is already saying, "It's settled, then. Let's patch you up." With a sudden blossomed smile. He breathes smoothly now.

Cas squeezes his fingers back.

Dean lays his hands -- the real hand in the real world now, no longer in his brain -- on the edge of Cas's giant vessel's hand. Palm to palm, in the best sense he can manage.

"Okay, Cas, you're up, do you magic." Dean says cheerfully to the air, aiming at the back corner of the mind.

Cas sits down on Bobby's sofa in his mind. "I know you'd hate losing control." He says, "You can be the driver. I'll be the fuel."

Dean blinks. "Didn't know it's even possible,"

"Imagine you're an angel," says Cas, *imagine you're me*, "the grace is all at your disposal." *All of me is at your disposal.*

Dean swears he hears the double take of the words Cas just said. *Guess now that we're sharing the brain room, there is nowhere to hide the true thoughts then.* Dean amuses.

Which just gets confirmed by Cas's quiet thought: *Yes*.

They don't even need to talk anymore. Just the thoughts. Almost like... two-way prayer, minus the praying part. Something like a real soul phone this time.

Dean tries to imagine how it's like to really *be* an angel, as giant and bright as he can imagine, channeling the grace to his hand. It isn't easy in the first try, the mortal feeling is still too strong, the feet are too stuck to the ground he can't fly. Then, the lighter feeling comes in. He remembers the flying particles in the air and the shifting plasma that creates the colors and lights on the aurora, the color and the lights in the vision. He imagines being an angel -- being Cas -- walking the Earth, seeing the biggest and smallest things, witnessing the universe from its birth to its doom.

He imagines three pairs of wings spread out on his back from the shoulder blades, he imagines looking down at the earth as if he's flying, or his eyes are a thousand feet high, and that he has thousands of eyes. He imagines white blue lights flowing from his eyes. For a moment, Dean feels so disoriented at the imagination that he wonders if it's still his own mind imagining, or it's Cas's memory seeping in.

Golden lights flow out of Dean's palms, sinking into the giant body. The center of his palm is warm. The air around the glowing light seems to be shifting, like the air above burning hot asphalt roads in a hot summer day, melting and steaming, making the distant views distorted. Or the air above a burning pyre.

The heated air around the body changes the form and shape of the flesh, just like the vision of stretches of the road shift through the heated air. Shortly, Dean finds it difficult to tell if it's because the air deceives the vision, or the actual physical shape of Cas's body is being transformed. Some distant part of his body seems to be sizing down, but Dean can't really tell for sure. There are more lights gathering.

He continues to try anyway, focusing on the thought that he's fixing Cas's body up. Dean still finds the idea too unearthly, he would rather it like fixing Impala's engine, one that he can open the hood, disconnect and reconnect the pipes, and see the broken parts, then he can use wrenches and screwdrivers to fix it. It's easy.

He is good at fixing things, he has always been. And the process of seeing something recovered from broken, it calms him. He's not the one breaking things, he's the one that fixes them. Dean thinks. He just wishes he's as good in fixing people.

His memory wanders back to the time when he has to watch Sam hurt bad from the hallucination of Lucifer, then Cas hurt as bad after taking over the craziness. Though Dean never really know what has happened in their heads back then. Something thousands of times worse than what he could see, he can only presume.

The view is even more wobbly now, the air is filled with more sparkling lights of small flying particles, brighter than what he just started grow used to. The vision is like the plain human view with a layer of celestial special effect on top, then another brighter layer, covering the reality. He can barely see the giant body in front of him clearly now. He finds his own attention slipping away.

Dean blinks. The view changes completely.
