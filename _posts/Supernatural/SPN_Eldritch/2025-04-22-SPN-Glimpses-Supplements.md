Some credits, references, and inspirations. Some Easter eggs that were quite enjoyable to smuggle in.

<br>

Chap. 2 The legends of the giant fish and bird mentioned by Artemis: Quoted and translated from Zhuangzi's article "[Free and Easy Wandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book))" (庄周《逍遥游》) written around 300 BC. So the legend is indeed from over two thousand years ago. The first paragraph in original text goes like this: "北冥有鱼，其名为鲲。鲲之大，不知其几千里也；化而为鸟，其名为鹏。鹏之背，不知其几千里也，怒而飞，其翼若垂天之云。" I put the words in Artemis's mouth. I've loved the story of this giant fish turning into the giant bird [Peng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_(mythology)) so much ever since the first time I learned it in school. So when I needed an ancient mythology of a big bird, this is the first thing popped into my mind.

Chap. 2 How does Dean know the names of trees, plants, creatures, and birds: Apparently Cas has dragged him to watch the Nature Channel together more than once, and he actually paid attention, and secretly enjoyed a lot but still pretends to groan and complain whenever it's suggested. Especially the bird part, he doesn't even realize he has a thing for them until much later. And also in here when he's in the woods, he realizes he does memorized a lot of things and names he watched which is life-savingly useful, while thinking about Cas's wings. But still, even when they were watching together and when he was definitely thinking about Cas's wings, he never really asked, so he never know Cas's wings' true color or how many pairs he has. Maybe there will be an epilogue of watching bird documentaries together or go back to the Redwood again with Cas guiding and introducing the creatures and plants properly. And Cas might get surprised and impressed by Dean's knowledge.

Chap. 3 "Something from the angel as the medium, the things he recognize as his, to guide him to the call": The medium is not trench coat or feather, it's Dean's body warmth on them, it's Dean. It's always Dean.

Chap. 3 Dean looks at the painted eye on Missouri's round table for seance and immediately starts staring at it: From Dean's view, it looks like Cas's eyes; from Cas's view, it's also what Dean looks like when only "eyes of his mind" travel into the dimension in between. He has no body but only a floating green eye, so it's also a very strange scene, Cas would have commented but end up not getting a chance to write that line or in Cas's point of view.

Chap. 4 "Did he dream about purgatory when he's outside, or did he dream about outside when he's still in purgatory": It might be a stretch to say but it's inspired somewhat by another ancient Chinese article of Zhuangzi's "[The Butterfly Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)#%22The_Butterfly_Dream%22)" (庄周梦蝶). The story is about once Zhuangzi dreamed of becoming a butterfly, and wondered if he's really Zhuangzi who dreamed as a butterfly, or he's actually a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi. The confusion between inside and outside of dream world, it fascinated me for decades and it still does. So that djinn world storyline plays with that idea a bit.

Chap. 4 The joke Amelia whispers by Sam's ear that cracks his laughter is: "I hope you won't name our kid 'Kid'."

Chap. 4 Meg leaves a note saying Alaska is the World's End: In the design setting, Alaska is not the only end. There are other ends, anywhere that feels like can't go any farther can be an "end." If that torn scrap were larger, Meg would have added another line there: "Try Ushuaia or Iceland if you like, but figured Alaska would be the closest to you."

Chap. 6 The quoting texts about cats' biology in Cas's knowledge library: Quoted from Wikipedia

Chap. 6 The vast past memories of a long-life being, and the infinite future possibilities, enough to fit an infinite hole: Inspired by Doctor Who S07E07 "The Rings of Akhaten", one of my favorite episodes.

Chap. 6 The unexpected nuclear reaction making the light and energy regenerating and exploding exponentially: It's triggered when Cas's grace and Dean's soul touch, they're like two halves of a nuclear core, the moment they connect, the reaction begins. They initially think it might be a chemical reaction, but it's far stronger than chemical-level. It's nuclear. The bond is nuclear.

Chap. 6 The memories and apologies and forgiveness and kisses in the head: They are parallel to the body-fixing process and absolutely necessary in order to make Cas stay and be whole again, because, the dimension in between doesn't only shred and mess up Cas's body and forms on the outside, not just the splicing of wings and the vessel, but also inside the head. Like Dean realized earlier, the angelic memories and the screwed-up psychological knots and very human emotions, those are broken and need healing too. So they go through that fixing process in parallel, though even neither of them quite realize at the time.

About all the physics theories that hopefully explain the supernatural things: That part goes viral and out of control totally on its own. The very initial design was only to provide an explanation why Cas becomes giant, and then suddenly all the quantum physics knowledge kicks in and there is no stopping it. It is funny to think Cas must be familiar with all the modern mathematics and physics since there are more than one occurrence in canon where he said something about "I can draw a diagram to explain this" or "an equation to explain that". It wouldn't be a surprise if all that things we human thinks supernatural (especially the parts about time and space and dimension) is only because we haven't found the science behind it, but angels know. Pretty sure the writers not see quantum physics playing a role when they write the line "multidimensional wavelength celestial being". Not even I come to think about Mass-Energy Equivalence until writing the last chapter. It has been so much fun to write and see there is no humanoid enemy, only the natural order and law of physics. Only the reality of the world itself.

This is the second time in a row I've written basically "love saves the world". Probably should stop doing that. Or not.
