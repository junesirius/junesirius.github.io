A sudden chilly air blows to his body, Dean shivers in the drop of temperature. It is different from the icy wind in Alaska though, more like... Dean glances around on instinct, and finds an open window with thin flying curtain. He looks around, bewildered. The view seems somewhat familiar, but he can't quite place it immediately.

The wall is white, so is the single small bed in the center of the room, with protect bars on both sides. It's an infirmary bed. He's in a hospital, of some sort.

Dean looks down at himself, and he freezes. He's in hospital clothing, soft white shirt and pants. The same hospital dressing he sees Cas wore near the end of last year, and the whole time when he was in the Purgatory. Dean has to put the trench coat over him to cover the sick feeling at the sight and reminder of the meaning of that hospital dressing, but he sees it all the time anyway. His right wrist has a blue paper loop.

"Cas?" Dean frowns hard at his hand in his view -- the hand that is undoubtedly belonged to Cas, whispering. "Is this... your memory?"

Cas's voice passes into his mind slowly, surprised as well, a slight "Oh", then, "I think it might be because of my grace. Some memory is too deep entangled with the grace, when you channel them, they go past your soul. The process may affect your perceptions, as if seeing through my eyes."

He pauses, hesitating.

*There are some things he doesn't want me to see.* Dean thinks, feeling the edge of some emotion start crawling up.

"No, Dean, not hiding from you, not lying," Cas's voice is already answering to his realization before the name of these emotions can settle in, before Dean can really take a grasp of them. "I will not do that again. But these memories, they might be uncomfortable to watch. I just don't want you harmed."

"You lived through those, didn't you?" Dean says, not waiting for an answer. "Surely it can't hurt me like the past has hurt you. The least I can do is to learn how bad it is."

Cas falls silent for a moment, then says very quietly. "Dean, they're really bad."

And Dean answers him, "Close your eyes then, if you don't want to relive them. Hold my hand if you want." They're not really face to face in the mental living room any more, so really, that's just a metaphorical speaking. But Cas gets it.

The view of the hospital tunes in and out, as if looking through a bad telescope, with the focus lens being screwed constantly. Dean squints at the view, feeling a headache growing at the back of the skull just by looking at it.

He murmurs, "That's how you saw things during those times, Cas? And I was blaming you for being... you know, nuts?"

*That's the better days.* Cas answers through thought.

"God, I'm sorry." Dean says, "What's a bad day like?"

Cas stays quiet, but as if an answer, the view shifts. The hospital dissolves into a library, a beautiful, ancient library that Dean has only seen in the most fancy movie scenes. The arched ceilings are so tall that as if they are the sky, the corridors are long and wide, and there are countless bookshelves with beautiful delicately carved markings and decorations like the tall pillars of ancient cathedrals from Roman era. And then there are the books, the books that Dean imagines should all have been kept neatly on the shelves, indexed and illustrated, carefully sorted and placed. Except, they are not.

The library is a post-tornado mess. The remnant of the beauty and grand of the place remains, but the books are so scattered that Dean doesn't know if there is a place he can step on without accidentally treading on the books. The pages are torn and mixed, the beautifully carved glistening covers lay around everywhere on the ground. The shelves are disoriented as well, only those on his close vicinity standing in roughly parallel, further down the corridor, many of them are pushed down to the floor, the remaining standing ones are crossed left and right. The whole place is more like a rumpled sea of random pages than a library now.

But when Dean looks closely, he notices the shelves are not all empty. The ones closest to him, some books have been reassembled and placed back on to the racks. The covers and pages are still visibly worn out, but they remain stand on the edge of each rack. *Survivors of the tornado? Maybe?* Dean thinks, finding it a comfort to see there are remaining books on the shelves, that the place is not completely ruined.

"Where is this place?" Dean asks. Cas doesn't answer.

Instead, Dean finds his body kneel down to the floor, reaching for a page -- not *his* body, Dean mentally corrects himself, it's Cas's memory, it's Cas's body now. His fingers touch a page closest to him, and he starts reading it. There is an illustration of a cat on the page, a lazy tabby lies on the page, holding its tongue out, long and pink, staring at him. The text below reads "*Sharp spines or papillae can be found in a cat's tongue, there are five types of papillae...*" along with some other notes and explanations.

His finger turns the page over. On the back side, it is a different section about some other knowledge of cat, and it starts talking about "*Felines, especially domestic cats, are well known for having penile spines, which is needed to stimulate the female cat into ovulation...*"

He hears a low sigh in his throat, fingers touching the word "female cat" and his voice saying "*I know for a fact the females were not consulted about that.*"

His body stands up, and puts the page inside one of the books on the shelf to the right of him. The cover says "*Anatomy of the Cat*", and it's about half the thickness as the book is supposed to be, all the pages loosen. And with a glance, Dean realizes all the other books on the shelves are all in a similar condition -- worn, torn, pages loosen, but Cas is putting them back in.

Cas walks back to the pile of the books that is mountain high, and picks another page. This one has some monkeys dancing around a bonfire, as if singing and talking, as if highly intelligent, just like... oh, not monkeys, that's the primal human beings. Dean glances at the note, which says something about Neanderthals and their poetries and rituals. Dean finds his head dizzy again. Cas, in this memory, in his body, just stands up from the floor, walks over to the shelf, and puts the page into a different book on a different shelf, that says "*Human Evolution*". And he goes back to pick the next page.

The realization weighs on his chest so heavy that Dean fears his ribs might get crushed the next minute. He wants to raise his hand to catch his own chest, but the body feels fine, the breathing is normal. The body is still following, replaying the movement from the memory, like a pre-configured robot.

The random comments here and there. The pieces of knowledge and the glints of attention. "*Did you know that a cat's penis is sharply barbed along its shaft?*" "*I was backing the Neanderthals because their poetry was... just amazing. It's in perfect tune with the spheres. You guys ate the apple, invented pants.*" The Cas in the hospital, smiling at him, holding a finger saying "Pull it", and start talking about cats and dogs and monkeys and bees...

Dean stares at the pages and books and shelves again, feeling his eyes would sting if he has control over the body.

The pieces.

That's all the pieces of Cas's mind.

Broken.

Torn apart.

Like tornado sweeping through the library, all the knowledge are still here, but so scattered, so broken, that he had to put them back, piece by piece, page by page, reading each one of them, then looking at the next. Each piece can be from a far too different topic, a different book, a different area of the brain. He takes the page, walks to the correct shelf, puts them in between the book cover, then walks back, and does the same again for the next piece.

"*It took everything to get me here.*" Cas had already told him, back then, in the hospital, hadn't he? But Dean didn't listen, he just, couldn't understand. Dean winces, wondering what he was distracted by at that time, that he could let that statement slip through without really asking "*What had happened*". Then he remembers, he was angry, back then, so angry that all he can think of is snapping at Cas, telling him "button up his coat and help them take down the Leviathans", because that was all his fault. All the while Cas is in here, inside his own head, going round and round, piecing himself together.

"I'm sorry." says Cas.

His voice startles Dean.

"What?" Dean asks. He means, *Why are you apologizing? I should be the one. I should have known things are difficult, so difficult. You're already doing your best, you're always doing the best. Regardless of the result, you tried, you tried so damn hard. I should have known. I should have at least asked...*

And Cas says again, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry I destroyed everything. I'm sorry I was afraid I will destroy everything again. I'm sorry about all the mess and..."

"Cas," Dean stops him, he can barely find his own voice. "I'm sorry, too. And I forgive you, Cas. I forgave you long time ago."

But Cas is still saying, "I'm sorry..." As if his mind is back on that old self, looped like a cassette tape, playing the only message it can keep focus on. His body picks another page, and another. He reads them, and puts them into the right places. *He needs to piece himself together, he needs to piece himself together because there is something important outside that needs fix, because there is someone important outside that is waiting for him, because they also have too many important things to fix...*

"Hey, hey, Cas." Dean nudges him mentally, thinking hard to focus back onto the view of Bobby's living room.

And he's back into that warm bright sunshine and lazy afternoon that they never had. Cas is slump in the sofa, curled small, as if trying to hold himself together. As if he's still broken.

Dean puts a hand on his shoulder. Cas is startled.

Dean lowers himself in front of the sofa. His eyes level with Cas's.

"Listen to me," he starts, then pauses, his mind wandering back to Cas's library. The grand, beautiful hall, the ancient shelves, the countless books. What would it look like when Cas is not broken? When everything is ancient and elegant? Must be breath-taking. Must be as giant and beautiful as everything that Cas is. Dean tells him, "You're forgiven." and "I'll fix you."

Cas's ocean-blue eyes are on Dean's. The look of broken and pieces is still lingering in that deep blue ocean water, like shattered glasses floating on the wave. But he nods, small, and says, "Thank you."

So Dean continues.

In the outside world, more lights and grace flow through his palm, layer onto the giant vessel, coating him like a blanket made of light. The body becomes visibly smaller now, from the shape of a huge mountain and height of a skyscraper, to the size of a hill and height of the highest cathedral and library in the world.
