> Sam: They were just people, man. They weren't...demons. They weren't monsters. They...were just frickin' people.
>
> Dean: Yeah, well, like I said, people are sick.

> Crowley: <u>You don't know what it's like to be human!</u>
>
> [Dean just stares at him]
>
> Crowley: <u>It's your DNA. It's my addiction, my cross, my burden!</u>
>
> Dean: All right, take it easy.
>
> Crowley: I see the darkness of it now, the Anthony Weiner of it. It makes you needy.

> Crowley: Poor moose. It's always a little tricky keeping up, isn't it?
>
> Sam: [looking up to find Crowley staring at him] What are you doing?
>
> Crowley: I'm still a little tainted by humanity. Makes me sentimental.
>
> Sam: Well, stop.
>
> Crowley: You and I both know we shared a mo back in that church. And on some level, we are bonded.

> Crowley: I wouldn't be in this mess if it wasn't for you two. You shoot me up. You make me a junkie. You keep me stashed away for months while my kingdom falls apart?!

> Crowley: I did good, eh, moose? Everything on the list. You're welcome.
>
> Sam: [ignoring the plea, stands up and holds the bowl out] Remember -- stay close, do what I say, and shut the hell up.
>
> Crowley: I'm growing on you, aren't I?

> Crowley: You're lying to Sam like he's your wife, which kind of makes me your mistress.

> Crowley: I know that Cain gave you his Mark for a reason. And I know that rather than embracing it, rather than looking at it as the gift that it is, you're sulking like you lost your knuffle bunny. Why are you fighting what you really are?
>
> Dean: I'm a hunter.
>
> Crowley: Who's a chip off the old Mark of Cain.
>
> Dean: No. When I kill, I kill for a reason. I'm nothing like Cain.
>
> Crowley: <u>Nothing like -- who are you talking to? I know you're not talking to me.</u>
>
> Dean: Eat me.
>
> Crowley: I saw you. I saw the two of you together. Nothing like Cain? <u>What's in that bottle? Delusion? I'm really starting to worry about you, Dean.</u>
>
> Dean: Yeah, well, why don't you worry about yourself?
>
> Crowley: I will. 'Cause like it or not, we're in this together. Your problems, my problems... Our problems.
>
> [Crowley gets up and walks toward the back]
>
> Dean: Where you going now?
>
> Crowley: <u>I'm going to go water the lily. Care to cross streams? [Dean rolls he eyes] So serious.</u>

> Castiel: [looking at the honor bar fridge in the hotel room; mutters to himself] "Honor bar." What's honorable about a miniature bar in a motel room?
>
> Dean: [overhearing from the phone] Everything.
>
> Castiel: <u>[gently with a small smile] How are you, Dean?</u>
>
> Dean: [in the same tone] I'm fine, Cass. How 'bout you?
>
> Castiel: [whistfully] <u>I miss my wings. Life on the road... smells.</u>
>
> Dean: (chuckles) Hmm.

> GABRIEL: After it was raining winged men, hallelujah? Well, you know... total nigh-biblical chaos, Crowley and Aba-douche duking it out. Good times. And then there's our peeps, scattered like confetti.
>
> Castiel: There has been a lot of confusion.
>
> Gabriel: You think? Most angels aren't like us, Castiel. They can't handle this whole free-will thing. They're sheep, drones. But us? We're different. We're rebels... one without a 'cause, one with.
>
> Castiel: I'm just a soldier.
>
> Gabriel: Bitch, please. You've been God more often than Dad has.
>
> Castiel: (Chuckling) Yeah. Look how that worked out.
>
> Gabriel: Well, go ahead. Be a soldier all you want. I'm gonna need as many as I can find.
>
> Castiel: Why are you doing this, Gabriel?
>
> Gabriel: I always run...From Dad, from the family. I don't want to run anymore. I want to do what I was meant to do... lead.
>
> Castiel: Well, we need a leader. And I'm happy it's gonna be you.

> Gabriel: The angels need a leader, and it's got to be somebody like us... somebody different.
>
> Castiel: No.
>
> Gabriel: I know you don't want this burden, Castiel. Neither do I.
>
> Castiel: What if I fail again?
>
> Gabriel: You won't. You can't.
>
> Castiel: [suddenly pulls Gabriel into a hug] Thank you.
>
> Gabriel: [hugging him back] Shut up.

> Dean: All right, so what if there is a stairway to heaven? We find it and get a drop on the guy.
>
> Sam: You want to sneak onto the Death Star, take out the emperor?
>
> Castiel: Okay I... I'm not sure what a fictional battle station in space has to do with this, but if taking out the emperor means taking out Metatron, I'm on board.
>
> Dean: [exchanging confused looks with Sam] Wait, did you... did you just understand a Death Star reference?
>
> Castiel: Yeah, I think so. But I don't understand what that has to do with heaven.
>
> Sam: It's halfway, I guess.

> Dean: [pats Castiel on the shoulder with his right hand] I'm fine.
>
> [Castiel grabs his arm and pushes up his sleeve revealing the Mark. Castiel's eyes darken as his stares at Dean]
>
> Castiel: What have you done?
>
> Dean: [yanks his hand back] It's a means to an end.
>
> Castiel: <u>Damn it, Dean.</u>
