### Idea

**S04E01 Dean lobotomize Cas in Hell during angel rescue**

(inspired by a comment under my tumblr post mentioning Cas 0817 is lobotomized) (heavy angst, canon divergent)

start scene as if normal hospital operation scene, Dean enter in Doctor coat, acting operation on patient, they scream, turn out it's lobotomy, Dean enjoys the process and thinks he's doing the right thing (write in a way as if it's just a Doctor AU, but actually canon-divergent; unnoticeably showing Alastair & Dean interaction, Dean trusts him, Alastair showing him tricks and Dean outskills him, Alastair=father figure)

turn out this is in Hell, except not even Dean realizes that, he thinks he's doing the right thing, those people need that, so he's doing that to them, he knows it's causing them pain, but he thinks it's a good thing, he feels good about himself (calm tone, not angsty, easy at torturing); when some patient fight back, he constrain them with force, still think it's what's best for them

(the visual of pocket room of Hell, everyone's individual Hell: inspired by *Lucifer*)

then angels come to rescue, Cas is the first/only angel fights off all the demons outside his pocket-Hell and enter the operation room, get force transformed into human vessel form in there, Dean thinks he's just another soul to operate on, Cas try to reason with him, but rule one of save, Dean needs to agree to leave to be saved, but Dean doesn't even realize this is Hell so he wouldn't want to leave, and he just thinks Cas is another patient trying to fight/talk his way out; Dean force Cas down (win their fight, cuz Cas hold back, doesn't want to hurt the Righteous Man) to the operation table, lobotomize Cas, Cas forget why he's down here, that he's an angel and he's coming to save Dean, now Cas thinks he's same as Dean so hang around in the room, be his assistant

Cas without memory/knowledge, slow learner, but pick up the tools, operate on others like Dean show him, Dean start to get interested in him (though initially think he's just weird and need punish), fond of him, start trusting him; demons know he's angel, come in (in human form) try to take Cas away, Dean instinctively protect Cas, kill demons

Alastair (in doctor director costume) come in to try to take Cas away/kill him on sight, Dean doesn't let him, Alastair commands Dean kill Cas or he'd be disappointed at him (father figure), Dean hesitates, acts as if intend to kill Cas (Cas frightened) but ends up didn't, instead rebels to Alastair, leaves the operation room and takes Cas with him to outside, see real Hell, shocked, Cas remembers he has wing (reminded by Balthazar?/Dean, Dean believes what he said before lobotomy is true now, tell him back what he initially said), use wing to protect Dean (demon Dean can see Cas's wings), demons attack, Cas purely muscle memory fight (still vessel shape, still doesn't remember other things before lobotomy), hand on Dean's shoulder (burns Dean, yell) and flies him out ("Dean Winchester is saved"), remakes him

Cas go back to heaven to regain a copy of memory (backuped before fight/standard version for all angels) from Naomi (hint potential memory messed up again), back in time to meet Dean in barn again, canon compliant

### Outline

(S04E01 demon!Dean lobotomizes angel!Cas in Hell during angel rescue)

Starts as if normal hospital operation scene, almost like AU, Dean enters the operation room in doctor's white robe (with some blood stains), acting operation on patients. They scream, turn out it's lobotomy. Dean enjoys the process too much, thinks he's doing the right thing (write in a way as if it's just a doctor AU, but actually canon-divergent in Hell).

Alastair comes in to inspect, interacts with Dean naturally (like S04E17 *It's a terrible life* Zachariah), Dean trusts him (like father figure), Alastair shows him some tricks, Dean learns very quickly and outskills him.

Turns out this is in Hell, except not even Dean realizes that, his memory/thinking is messed up/wiped regularly too, partially manipulated but the operating part is his own voluntary actions. He genuinely believes he's a doctor, doing the right thing, those people need that, so he's doing the operation on them. He knows it's causing them pain, but he thinks it's a good thing, he feels good about himself (calm tone, not angsty, easy at torturing, very good at it). Some patients fight back, he constrains them with force, retaliates in operation, tortures them harder, they scream loud, Dean still thinks it's what's best for them.

The angels come to rescue, Cas is the first/only angel fights off all the demons outside this pocket-Hell and enters the operation room. Because of the pocket dimension rule, Cas's angel power is suppressed, he's just like a powerless human vessel (forced by the rule, can't fight it). Dean thinks he's just another patient to operate on. Cas tries to reason with him, but rule one of his rescue mission, Dean needs to voluntarily agree to leave the place in order to be saved, but Dean doesn't even realize this is Hell, so he doesn't want to leave, and he just thinks Cas is another patient trying to fight/talk his way out of the operation. He wouldn't allow that.

They fight, Dean is a strong demon, Cas is a bit hold back, doesn't want to hurt the Righteous Man, Dean wins. Dean forces Cas lie down on the operation table, straps him, lobotomizes him. Cas forgets why he's down here, where they are, that he's an angel and he's coming to save Dean, now Cas thinks he's the same as Dean, so he hangs around in the room, wants to be his assistant.

Cas without memory/knowledge, is a slow learner, but willing to learn, instinctively clingy to Dean (angel base code is still there, muscle memory knows he needs to get Dean out of there, at least make sure Dean's safe). Cas for the first time picks up operation tools, operates on others like Dean shows him. Dean starts to get interested in him (though initially thinks he's just weird and need punish), fond of him, starts trusting him.

Demons know Cas is angel, comes in (in human form), tries to take Cas away, Dean instinctively protects Cas, views demons as threats, protects Cas, kills demons.

Alastair (in doctor director costume) comes in to try to take Cas away, or try to kill him on sight. Dean doesn't want, tries to get in the way, but still hesitant of fighting against father figure. Alastair commands Dean to kill Cas, or he'd be disappointed at him (more father figure authority), Dean hesitates, acts as if intends to kill Cas (Cas frightens) but ends up didn't. Instead, Dean rebels against Alastair, leaves the operation room and takes Cas with him to outside, sees the real Hell, shocked, remembers he's a demon. Cas remembers he has wings (reminded by Dean, Dean believes what he said before lobotomy is true now, retells him what he initially said), uses wings to protect Dean.

Demons attack, more angels are high up but can't come down (including Balthazar?). Cas purely muscle memory fights (still vessel shape, still doesn't remember other things before lobotomy, not remember why they need to save Dean but he finds his own motivation/reason already, doesn't need to know it's mission). Cas uses wings to protect Dean, demon Dean can see Cas's wings, demon Dean helps Cas in fighting other demons and gets both of them out of there. Cas's palm on Dean's shoulder (burns Dean, Dean yells in pain), and flies Dean out of Hell ("Dean Winchester is saved"), a parting scene. Cas rebuilds Dean's body and buries him in the field (wipes himself from Dean's Hell memory, ashamed of himself, feel like he's doing lobotomy to Dean again).

Cas goes back to Heaven to regain a copy of memory (backuped before going down to Hell/standard version for all angels) from Naomi (hint potential memory messed up again), goes back in time to meet Dean in the barn again. Both don't remember the time in Hell together, but feel familiar. Canon compliant.

Some patients fight back, he constrains them with force, retaliates in operation, tortures them harder, they scream loud, Dean still thinks it's what's best for them.

"Your skills have improved, Dean." The doctor inspects the patient lying on the operation table, as Dean wipes his blade on his coat. The white gown has turned to mostly red, with all the blood splashing on it.

"I still have much to learn, Master," Dean answers, turning back with a smaller precision knife.

"You just need some more practice, that's all. You only did it for ten years; give it another ten years, you'll be as good as me." The doctor pats his shoulder encouragingly, pointing at the edge of the patient's head. "See here? You still hesitated when you cut in, distracted by their crying. You need to focus. When you operate on them, you can't be bothered by those screams, you have to enjoy them, you have to finish your job. In fact, the more they scream, it means the more effective your work is, it means you're doing it right."

"Yes, Master." Dean answers obediently, studying the patient's half-cut skull and the flesh and liquid dripping out that used to be part of the brain.

"Go on, continue. You know what's next -- cut out their brain. Lobotomy is always the best part. It's so beautiful, it's more art than science." His master urges, standing next to the table with folded arms.

The patient is crying some nonsense, cursing them, calling them demons, screaming non-stoppingly -- Dean blocks out the noise, focusing on the task, the fun part. He knows he has to hurry, or the patient will just pass out in pain -- it will be useless to operate without them feel anything, according to the doctor.

He cuts into the opened skull, all the way through the brain structure, watching the blood and flesh split apart under his knife. The patient twitches on the operation table involuntarily, until slowly the move dies down and the scream quiets.

Dean glances at his master nervously with a frown. "Is it too deep?"

The doctor rounds to his side of the table, speculating the cut he just made, taking over his knife. He gestures for Dean to look closer, and cuts into the brain himself. New blood streams down his hand.

"If you cut two inches to the left, stabbing in right through here," he instructs while operates. "This can cut out most of the memory, but leaves the emotions and pains still sensitive. So they won't remember who they are, what they're doing, or anything at all, but they'll still feel it. They won't pass out yet. And if you patch their skull back up like this, they can still walk and talk, might not even realize what's happened to them, making them the perfect little puppy. You just have to do it right."

"I'm sorry." Dean lowers his eyes. "I remember you showing me, but I can't seem to get it right."

"You're the best student I've ever seen," his master comforts him, taking out the knife and licking clean the blood dripping from the blade with his tongue. "Do you trust me?"

"Of course, Master," Dean answers quickly, looking up.

"And you're having fun?"

"Yes."

The doctor smiles. "Good," then yells at the door's direction. "Next!"

Two nurses open the operation door and dash in, wheeling the passed-out patient out, and another two pushing in the next one cuffed and tied up on the operation table. The screams from other rooms permeate the air in the corridor, passing into the room during the short breaks when the door is opened. Dean hears them, but he's already got used to it.

"How many operations are out there?" he asks, as he turns to the tool table, examining his knives and tools, getting ready for the new operation.

"Hundreds of thousands," the doctor answers simply.

"And all these people," Dean gestures to the new one lying there, who's struggling and crying even louder than the last one, wailing for mercy. "They all deserve it? The operation and the punishment?"

The doctor narrows his black eyes, thinning into a line. "Are you having feelings for them, Dean? Do you prefer to be the one lying there, instead?"

"No," Dean answers hastily, picking up the biggest knife on the table, grabbing its handle tight in his hand, walking toward the frightened patient. One tip of his lips curl up with joy and expectation of what's coming next. "I don't know why I asked that."

He buries the knife into the patient's skull. The crying turns into a desperate painful howl.

Dean watches the blood pour out of the cutting line, smelling the sweet taste of blood suffusing the whole operation room. Light of excitement glints in his black eyes. He grins wider. "Of course, they deserve this, they deserve all the pain. I'm doing them a favor."

He cuts a second time, a deeper line. Half the blade is buried inside the skull before he takes it out. His hands are not shaking.

"How did I do this time, Master Alastair?"

Alastair smiles with a hint of proud. "Attaboy."

### Chap 2

> The angels come to rescue, Cas is the first/only angel fights off all the demons outside this pocket-Hell and enters the operation room. Because of the pocket dimension rule, Cas's angel power is suppressed, he's just like a powerless human vessel (forced by the rule, can't fight it).

> They fight, Dean is a strong demon, Cas is a bit hold back, doesn't want to hurt the Righteous Man, Dean wins. Dean forces Cas lie down on the operation table, straps him, lobotomizes him. Cas forgets why he's down here, where they are, that he's an angel and he's coming to save Dean, now Cas thinks he's the same as Dean, so he hangs around in the room, wants to be his assistant.

They hear some disturbance outside the door, when Dean is halfway working on the tenth operation of the day -- or maybe the hundred and tenth, he doesn't really know the difference. He's enjoying it way too much to keep a close count. The moves are getting familiar, but there is always something slightly different that makes every single one fresh and intriguing.

They hear vague sounds of bodies crashing onto the wall, and the crying is more high-pitched.

Dean changes a look with Alastair, slowing down his move in hand, moving to follow.

Alastair gives him a gesture, telling him to stay, "You okay with finishing this up without me here?"

"Yes," Dean shifts his eyes back to the opened skull, eying the structure that his blade should aim next, but half his attention is still distracted by the unusual noise outside the door. He hesitates.

A nurse barges in -- which has never happened before, either. Dean knows Alastair has given them explicit rules of not disturbing them unless they're called. The nurse blinks rapidly, his black eyes showing nothing but panic. "They're here. They --" he can't seem to form a coherent sentence, or make it any clearer about what he's talking about than merely a "they".

Dean wonders what could possibly scare them like this. This is merely a hospital with operations and surgeries. There's no one other than doctors, nurses, and patients that can't move away from the operation beds. Perhaps a patient outbreak?

Alastair shoves the nurse outside the door and steps to the threshold, glancing left and right. The screams and sounds of fighting are louder now, and they sound like moving, getting closer.

"Just an outbreak, nothing to worry about," Alastair speaks over his shoulder. "I'll get it settled in two minutes, you stay here."

"Yes, Master." Dean answers, turning his attention back at the patient. The door clicks shut after Alastair leaves.

<br>

His master doesn't come back in two minutes.

Dean finishes up the patient on the operation table, carefully cutting out all the brain tissues like he's taught while ensuring the object is still wide awake and can feel everything. This one screams louder and longer than the last one. He's getting better at the skills. Dean grins slightly at himself, feeling good. His master praised him being a better artist every day. He wants nothing more than making him proud.

The patient continues the crying for a lingering minute, but eventually the voice wanes down again.

Dean wipes his knife on its skin with some grudge for not making this moment last longer -- he doesn't notice if it's a he or her; they are just patients, nameless, genderless, species-less; they're just all nothing more than objects that make sounds and feel pain. His master also gave order that he should perfect his skills so that these objects could feel as much pain as they possibly could, and that's the way to become the best brain surgeon that he's meant to be, so that is exactly what Dean is doing -- practicing day in and day out for the past ten years, trying his best to enjoy every moment of it.

Alastair still isn't coming back after he finishes the cleaning. And no nurse comes in even if he tries calling out a "Next" like his master used to do.

Dean is just wondering if he should get outside to check out what's happening, or maybe giving his master a hand if those patients are getting too naughty, when his operation door is crashed open again. A young man stumbles in, looking feeble and lost.

Dean narrows his eyes. The young man has cuts and blood stains on his face, his trench coat different from the nurses' coats, which means he can't be a nurse that he's never seen before, which can only mean he's one of those outbreaking patients who happens to run into his chamber. Dean needs to eliminate the danger for the hospital.

He grabs his largest operation knife on the table and steps toward the man.

The young man blinks rapidly after he comes into the room, staring at Dean like his eyes can't focus on him for a second -- or maybe focusing too hard on something he can't see that distracts him. His eyes are different from all the nurses and his master or himself, too, Dean notices. He has different pupil, not black like them, but blue. It only makes him more sure he's just one of the escaping patients.

"You shouldn't run around like that," Dean tells him, approaching carefully. He doesn't want him get away and run around again.

"I'm looking for you," the young man answers. His blinking slows down, and now changes to a staring with full attention. "After all this time, we finally reach you, Dean Winchester. You have to leave with me."

Dean takes another small step closer to the man, shaking his head and grinning in a way he hopes it's comforting to the startling patient. "I'm not going anywhere, neither are you." He tilts his head to the operation table without looking. "In fact, why don't you do both of us a favor and lie down there? I promise I'll finish it nice and quick, you wouldn't feel a thing. What do you say?" He grins with his teeth showing.

The young man gives a quick glance at the table behind him, frowning deep. Dean realizes he forgets there's another one lying on there, but it shouldn't be a problem, he can just dump it to the ground. He hopes the cuffs and belts could still be reused.

The man regards him up and down, his frowns deepening, and his voice getting lower. "Dean, you're not in a hospital, this is Hell. You're in Hell. It must be demon's tricks. We're here to save you. I'm Castiel, Angel of the Lord. We have order to bring you out of Hell, but you have to be willing to leave with us -- with me. Please, come with me."

Dean isn't affected, continues taking a small step toward the young man who calls himself Castiel. Dean eyes the distance between the man and the door, calculating if he should block the door first or aim to restrain the man's hands first. The man looks a few inches shorter than him, and not very strong, and probably already exhausted from whatever they were doing before in the corridor, judging by his heavy panting and the rising and falling of his chest. He knows he can win the fight easily.

Dean simply smiles at him, telling Castiel, "That's a very nice story you come up with to tell yourself. Certainly better than a patient who needs a surgery to get rid of all the rotten part in your head. But guess what, I'm professional, I'm the best brain surgeon you can get in here. Usually I take appointment, but see, today's your lucky day, I happen to have a vacancy in the schedule before my master comes back. I'll work on you first, what do you say?"

Castiel shakes his sleeves, and a silver blade appears in his palm. But he looks hesitant to raise it. "Please, Dean," he's still speaking in that low, urgent, almost pleading tone. "I don't want to hurt you. My order is to save you."

Dean meets his blue eyes, curving his lips. "That wouldn't be a concern," he says brightly. "The funny thing is, my order is to fix you. I think you just want to talk your way out of the surgery, and I can't allow that."

Dean marches to the man who called himself an angel -- *Who would call themselves angels?* Dean laughs in his mind while his knife striking Castiel in the arms. Castiel raises his blade for defense. The two blades crash into each other, bursting into sparks. The vibration makes the man stumbles back a step, Dean closes the distance in the blink of an eye.

Castiel raises his palms before him, in a way like in those superhero movies that they try to fire some palm cannon. Dean eyes him with some amusement -- this man really takes that angel theory seriously, which only proves him more sick and in need of the surgery.

Dean grabs his wrists easily and forces him to drop the blade. Castiel yells when Dean twists his wrists outward, dragging him toward the operation table.

"Please, Dean, I don't want to hurt you. I just want to save you. Open your eyes, see it, see this is Hell! You need to leave this place."

Dean huffs a laugh. He doesn't understand how can this man still insist on it but he doesn't have time to argue right now. The man doesn't weigh much, but he's struggling violently. Dean doesn't want to have to knock him out -- he'll have to wait for hours for him to come to before starting the operation, he doesn't want to wait.

Dean cuts his hands instead, leaning the surgery blade on his arms. "Quiet!" he snaps, "Or I might cut off your hands and feet!"

That successfully makes the man shut up for about two seconds.

He hears Castiel sigh, and then murmur quietly. "I'm sorry we didn't come earlier, I'm sorry you're already a demon now."

This pisses Dean off -- he doesn't need a random dude pop up and sound as if he's better than him, as if he's something bad and corrupted. Dean accelerates his works, holding Castiel's wrists in one hand, opening the cuffs and belts on the operation table with the other -- he has to use his teeth to help at one point, but the knots and locks finally give way. He shoves that previous one off to the ground, not bothering to check if that body is still breathing or not -- it's never their concern.

It takes him even longer than shutting him up to lock Castiel in place on the operation table. But this is not the first violent patient who struggles so much that the whole table moves or tries to fight back or even escape. Dean forces him down, tightening the belts around his middle, strapping him in place. All his feet and hands are cuffed, and there's an extra belt around the neck that he tightens it so much that it straddles the man's throat, not leaving an inch to move.

Castiel lies there, can do nothing but blink and pant. But he still keeps his eyes follow Dean. "Deep down, you know I'm right. You didn't forget everything before Hell. Remember Earth, Dean, remember life. You're a hunter, not a doctor."

Dean barks at him. "Yes, I am! I'm a doctor all my life! And I'm damn good at it! I'm gonna show you just in a second and you'll know this is the reality! The hospital, the knife, the surgery, not your angel-demon Heaven-Hell crap!"

He picks the longest, sharpest blade and cuts through the man's head, blood and a mysterious light flowing out of the wound in a way he never sees before. And that thread of light burns his finger if he touches it. Dean frowns at the man, confused, but he refuses to stop. At the end of the day, it's just biology, and his fingers already have the muscle memory to go through all the cutting and motions while his mind wanders around to think about what that light can possibly be.

Castiel starts screaming. The sound is sharper and higher-pitched than any of the hundreds that he's done before. The voice reaches Dean like a real physical blade, cutting through his skin and reaching somewhere deep down in him, but he can't quite figure out.

The pain is so vivid and sharp within that sound, and Dean laughs. He feels his mouth open and laughter comes out of him, getting louder and huskier, as if trying to cover the sound of scream. He thinks that bubbling feeling inside his chest must be an ecstasy that is so much stronger than joy that he's feeling unfamiliar with. He thinks he feels happy for operating the most successfully in his whole career because he's causing this patient the most pain -- his master would be proud if he's here.

Dean tries not to ruin his joy so he cuts carefully. Once the skull is opened, he switches to the precision blade, cutting through the brain tissues like Alastair showed him before, reaching deep and precisely to cut out the part that should remove the memories but keep the feelings and sensations intact. He remembers his master mentioned, if he's doing it right, the patient can even walk and talk once he's done. He wonders if this can be his first successful patient.

Castiel never stops screaming, not even after Dean thinks he's done with the job. He even bothers himself to sew the skull and skin back -- he's just curious to see how this subject would perform. His hands are completely soaked with the man's blood when he's done.

Castiel is still conscious and breathing, yelling something unrecognizable.

Dean wipes his blades and hands, regarding him with a slight amusement and a huge achievement. He can't believe he did it.

"How you feel?" Dean asks him, wiping the blood off his face, just to see how his own work come out to be.

The screaming recedes slowly, long and labored, the sound getting dryer as time goes by.

Dean waits for a few more patient moments.

The unintelligible sound is getting more and more clear slowly.

He's calling "Dean," Dean realizes, frowning. The man called himself an angel is crying Dean's name over and over again during the whole operation. It doesn't make sense, but he decides not to think about that for now.

Dean waves a hand before his eyes, catching his attention. "Hey, you hear me? How you feel?"

Castiel blinks slowly, eyes following his movement tiredly. "Pain," he croaks out.

"Yeah, that's normal," Dean nods, assuring him. "What else do you remember? Your name, for example?"

The man's eyes drift around the ceiling, straying purposelessly for a while before focusing back onto his face. He shakes his head. "I don't remember," he says cluelessly.

"Anything else you remember? Those bullshits you were talking about when you came in here?" Dean studies him closely, trying to catch any sign that the man is pretending, but he doesn't find any.

The man shakes his head again. "I don't remember," he says again, blankly. "Who am I?" he asks Dean, glancing at Dean's white doctor's coat. "Am I a doctor, like you?"

Dean huffs a loud laugh, genuinely amused. That's a first. He doesn't remember when's the last time he's truly laughing out of something funny, and this guy managed it.

"No, you're not." Dean tells him, unlocking his cuffs and the strap around his throat slowly, waiting to see how he'd behave. "You were a patient. But now you're fixed."

The man rubs his wrists slowly, thinking. "Can I be one like you, then?" he asks then. "I'd like to be like you, to learn this."

Dean raises his eyebrows. He can use a company like him. Life with only his master is still a little monotonous, even when counting all the fun from operations. He can use an assistant, or student, or something. He hopes his master wouldn't object.

"Sure, why not?" Dean says, untying the rest of the locks, giving the door a quick glance.

But the man doesn't seem to even notice the door. He takes a minute to wait for his feet to have feeling again and stumbles down the operation table. Looking up at Dean, he asks, "What's my name?"

"Cas --" Dean is about to say "Castiel" but he swallows the rest of the syllables, thinking might as well keep it simple and short, so he says, "That's your name. Cas."

"Cas," the man chews the name between his teeth for a few times, as if kids learning a new vocabulary, learning the combination of the syllables and sounds. "Cas. I'm Cas," he announces, pleased and joyful, also like a kid. "I like it. Thank you, Dean."

Dean laughs again, feeling a small fluffy sensation somewhere inside his chest. "Yeah, okay, no problem," he turns around, hiding his face, moving over to the table to grab an extra blade. He forgets to ask how come Cas can still remember Dean's name.

Dean stuffs the handle of the blade into Cas's hands.

"You said you want to learn, then let's start the class. We got a body right here."

> Alastair (in doctor director costume) comes in to try to take Cas away, or try to kill him on sight. Dean doesn't want, tries to get in the way, but still hesitant of fighting against father figure. Alastair commands Dean to kill Cas, or he'd be disappointed at him (more father figure authority), Dean hesitates, acts as if intends to kill Cas (Cas frightens) but ends up didn't. Instead, Dean rebels against Alastair, leaves the operation room and takes Cas with him to outside, sees the real Hell, shocked, remembers he's a demon. Cas remembers he has wings (reminded by Dean, Dean believes what he said before lobotomy is true now, retells him what he initially said), uses wings to protect Dean.

### Chap 4

> Demons attack, more angels are high up but can't come down (including Balthazar?). Cas purely muscle memory fights (still vessel shape, still doesn't remember other things before lobotomy, not remember why they need to save Dean but he finds his own motivation/reason already, doesn't need to know it's mission). Cas uses wings to protect Dean, demon Dean can see Cas's wings, demon Dean helps Cas in fighting other demons and gets both of them out of there. Cas's palm on Dean's shoulder (burns Dean, Dean yells in pain), and flies Dean out of Hell ("Dean Winchester is saved"), a parting scene. Cas rebuilds Dean's body and buries him in the field (wipes himself from Dean's Hell memory, ashamed of himself, feel like he's doing lobotomy to Dean again).
>
> Cas goes back to Heaven to regain a copy of memory (backuped before going down to Hell/standard version for all angels) from Naomi (hint potential memory messed up again), goes back in time to meet Dean in the barn again. Both don't remember the time in Hell together, but feel familiar. Canon compliant.
