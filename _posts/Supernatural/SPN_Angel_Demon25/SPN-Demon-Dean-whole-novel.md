### Idea

**S04E01 Dean lobotomize Cas in Hell during angel rescue**

(inspired by a comment under my tumblr post mentioning Cas 0817 is lobotomized) (heavy angst, canon divergent)

start scene as if normal hospital operation scene, Dean enter in Doctor coat, acting operation on patient, they scream, turn out it's lobotomy, Dean enjoys the process and thinks he's doing the right thing (write in a way as if it's just a Doctor AU, but actually canon-divergent; unnoticeably showing Alastair & Dean interaction, Dean trusts him, Alastair showing him tricks and Dean outskills him, Alastair=father figure)

turn out this is in Hell, except not even Dean realizes that, he thinks he's doing the right thing, those people need that, so he's doing that to them, he knows it's causing them pain, but he thinks it's a good thing, he feels good about himself (calm tone, not angsty, easy at torturing); when some patient fight back, he constrain them with force, still think it's what's best for them

(the visual of pocket room of Hell, everyone's individual Hell: inspired by *Lucifer*)

then angels come to rescue, Cas is the first/only angel fights off all the demons outside his pocket-Hell and enter the operation room, get force transformed into human vessel form in there, Dean thinks he's just another soul to operate on, Cas try to reason with him, but rule one of save, Dean needs to agree to leave to be saved, but Dean doesn't even realize this is Hell so he wouldn't want to leave, and he just thinks Cas is another patient trying to fight/talk his way out; Dean force Cas down (win their fight, cuz Cas hold back, doesn't want to hurt the Righteous Man) to the operation table, lobotomize Cas, Cas forget why he's down here, that he's an angel and he's coming to save Dean, now Cas thinks he's same as Dean so hang around in the room, be his assistant

Cas without memory/knowledge, slow learner, but pick up the tools, operate on others like Dean show him, Dean start to get interested in him (though initially think he's just weird and need punish), fond of him, start trusting him; demons know he's angel, come in (in human form) try to take Cas away, Dean instinctively protect Cas, kill demons

Alastair (in doctor director costume) come in to try to take Cas away/kill him on sight, Dean doesn't let him, Alastair commands Dean kill Cas or he'd be disappointed at him (father figure), Dean hesitates, acts as if intend to kill Cas (Cas frightened) but ends up didn't, instead rebels to Alastair, leaves the operation room and takes Cas with him to outside, see real Hell, shocked, Cas remembers he has wing (reminded by Balthazar?/Dean, Dean believes what he said before lobotomy is true now, tell him back what he initially said), use wing to protect Dean (demon Dean can see Cas's wings), demons attack, Cas purely muscle memory fight (still vessel shape, still doesn't remember other things before lobotomy), hand on Dean's shoulder (burns Dean, yell) and flies him out ("Dean Winchester is saved"), remakes him

Cas go back to heaven to regain a copy of memory (backuped before fight/standard version for all angels) from Naomi (hint potential memory messed up again), back in time to meet Dean in barn again, canon compliant

### Outline

(S04E01 demon!Dean lobotomizes angel!Cas in Hell during angel rescue)

Starts as if normal hospital operation scene, almost like AU, Dean enters the operation room in doctor's white robe (with some blood stains), acting operation on patients. They scream, turn out it's lobotomy. Dean enjoys the process too much, thinks he's doing the right thing (write in a way as if it's just a doctor AU, but actually canon-divergent in Hell).

Alastair comes in to inspect, interacts with Dean naturally (like S04E17 *It's a terrible life* Zachariah), Dean trusts him (like father figure), Alastair shows him some tricks, Dean learns very quickly and outskills him.

Turns out this is in Hell, except not even Dean realizes that, his memory/thinking is messed up/wiped regularly too, partially manipulated but the operating part is his own voluntary actions. He genuinely believes he's a doctor, doing the right thing, those people need that, so he's doing the operation on them. He knows it's causing them pain, but he thinks it's a good thing, he feels good about himself (calm tone, not angsty, easy at torturing, very good at it). Some patients fight back, he constrains them with force, retaliates in operation, tortures them harder, they scream loud, Dean still thinks it's what's best for them.

The angels come to rescue, Cas is the first/only angel fights off all the demons outside this pocket-Hell and enters the operation room. Because of the pocket dimension rule, Cas's angel power is suppressed, he's just like a powerless human vessel (forced by the rule, can't fight it). Dean thinks he's just another patient to operate on. Cas tries to reason with him, but rule one of his rescue mission, Dean needs to voluntarily agree to leave the place in order to be saved, but Dean doesn't even realize this is Hell, so he doesn't want to leave, and he just thinks Cas is another patient trying to fight/talk his way out of the operation. He wouldn't allow that.

They fight, Dean is a strong demon, Cas is a bit hold back, doesn't want to hurt the Righteous Man, Dean wins. Dean forces Cas lie down on the operation table, straps him, lobotomizes him. Cas forgets why he's down here, where they are, that he's an angel and he's coming to save Dean, now Cas thinks he's the same as Dean, so he hangs around in the room, wants to be his assistant.

Cas without memory/knowledge, is a slow learner, but willing to learn, instinctively clingy to Dean (angel base code is still there, muscle memory knows he needs to get Dean out of there, at least make sure Dean's safe). Cas for the first time picks up operation tools, operates on others like Dean shows him. Dean starts to get interested in him (though initially thinks he's just weird and need punish), fond of him, starts trusting him.

Demons know Cas is angel, comes in (in human form), tries to take Cas away, Dean instinctively protects Cas, views demons as threats, protects Cas, kills demons.

Alastair (in doctor director costume) comes in to try to take Cas away, or try to kill him on sight. Dean doesn't want, tries to get in the way, but still hesitant of fighting against father figure. Alastair commands Dean to kill Cas, or he'd be disappointed at him (more father figure authority), Dean hesitates, acts as if intends to kill Cas (Cas frightens) but ends up didn't. Instead, Dean rebels against Alastair, leaves the operation room and takes Cas with him to outside, sees the real Hell, shocked, remembers he's a demon. Cas remembers he has wings (reminded by Dean, Dean believes what he said before lobotomy is true now, retells him what he initially said), uses wings to protect Dean.

Demons attack, more angels are high up but can't come down (including Balthazar?). Cas purely muscle memory fights (still vessel shape, still doesn't remember other things before lobotomy, not remember why they need to save Dean but he finds his own motivation/reason already, doesn't need to know it's mission). Cas uses wings to protect Dean, demon Dean can see Cas's wings, demon Dean helps Cas in fighting other demons and gets both of them out of there. Cas's palm on Dean's shoulder (burns Dean, Dean yells in pain), and flies Dean out of Hell ("Dean Winchester is saved"), a parting scene. Cas rebuilds Dean's body and buries him in the field (wipes himself from Dean's Hell memory, ashamed of himself, feel like he's doing lobotomy to Dean again).

Cas goes back to Heaven to regain a copy of memory (backuped before going down to Hell/standard version for all angels) from Naomi (hint potential memory messed up again), goes back in time to meet Dean in the barn again. Both don't remember the time in Hell together, but feel familiar. Canon compliant.

### Claim

#### Claim Summary

Demon Dean lobotomizes Cas in Hell during angel rescue.

Hell has personalized rooms and demon Dean believes he's a surgeon and it's his job to lobotomize patients. Alastair is like a mentor and father figure to him in his mind. Cas comes to rescue him but he needs to persuade Dean to willingly leave with him. Dean thinks he's just another patient, overpowers him, and lobotomizes him.

Cas forgets he's an angel and his mission, Dean could have killed him but he doesn't. For some reason, demon Dean thinks Cas is different and interesting, so he takes Cas as his apprentice (like he is to Alastair), teaching him to torture other souls. Cas is a slow learner, but willing to follow any of Dean's orders. He's instinctively clingy to Dean and trusting Dean, and still has some subconscious muscle memory in fighting.

Alastair and other demons know Cas's an angel and come to kill him, Dean instinctively protects Cas, starts realizing demons are threats, rebels against Alastair and kills most of the demons to save Cas.

The two of them break out of Hell's personal room and get out, Dean realizes it really is Hell, Cas was telling him truth and really here to save him. Cas still doesn't remember much but Dean tells him what he said when he first came and now Dean is willing to trust him and leave with him. So Cas spreads his wings and protects Dean and flies them out of Hell. Demon Dean fights demons along the way to help. They farewell when they get out.

Cas remakes his body and deliberately removes Dean's memory of him during Hell because he's ashamed of what the amnesic him is like and what they did. Cas announces “Dean Winchester is saved” and buries him into the field.

Cas has to go back Heaven to regain a copy of his memory from Naomi (indicating another brainwash). Which makes both of them forget the Hell surgery room events.

And the ending is they reunite in the barn and start fresh.

#### Visual Elements

Demon Dean in doctor's white coat, holding a scalpel, operates on Cas's head when Cas lies bloody on an operation table in a hospital setting. Cas's hands are cuffed, belts locked around his body and throat.

Demon Dean stands against Alastair to protect Cas. Both holding blades, in fighting position. Other demons surround them.

Cas uses his wings to protect demon Dean against other demons. Demon Dean also helps protect him and fights other demons.

Cas flies Dean out of Hell.

The two of them are out of Hell, ready to farewell.

He genuinely believes he's a doctor, doing the right thing, those people need that, so he's doing the operation on them. He knows it's causing them pain, but he thinks it's a good thing, he feels good about himself (calm tone, not angsty, easy at torturing, very good at it). Some patients fight back, he constrains them with force, retaliates in operation, tortures them harder, they scream loud, Dean still thinks it's what's best for them.

"Your skills have improved, Dean." The doctor inspects the patient lying on the operation table, as Dean wipes his blade on his coat. The white gown has turned to mostly red, with all the blood splashing on it.

"I still have much to learn, Master," Dean answers, turning back with a smaller precision knife.

"You just need some more practice, that's all. You only did it for ten years; give it another ten years, you'll be as good as me." The doctor pats his shoulder encouragingly, pointing at the edge of the patient's head. "See here? You still hesitated when you cut in, distracted by their crying. You need to focus. When you operate on them, you can't be bothered by those screams, you have to enjoy them, you have to finish your job. In fact, the more they scream, it means the more effective your work is, it means you're doing it right."

"Yes, Master." Dean answers obediently, studying the patient's half-cut skull and the flesh and liquid dripping out that used to be part of the brain.

"Go on, continue. You know what's next -- cut out their brain. Lobotomy is always the best part. It's so beautiful, it's more art than science." His master urges, standing next to the table with folded arms.

The patient is crying some nonsense, cursing them, calling them demons, screaming non-stoppingly -- Dean blocks out the noise, focusing on the task, the fun part. He knows he has to hurry, or the patient will just pass out in pain -- it will be useless to operate without them feel anything, according to the doctor.

He cuts into the opened skull, all the way through the brain structure, watching the blood and flesh split apart under his knife. The patient twitches on the operation table involuntarily, until slowly the move dies down and the scream quiets.

Dean glances at his master nervously with a frown. "Is it too deep?"

The doctor rounds to his side of the table, speculating the cut he just made, taking over his knife. He gestures for Dean to look closer, and cuts into the brain himself. New blood streams down his hand.

"If you cut two inches to the left, stabbing in right through here," he instructs while operates. "This can cut out most of the memory, but leaves the emotions and pains still sensitive. So they won't remember who they are, what they're doing, or anything at all, but they'll still feel it. They won't pass out yet. And if you patch their skull back up like this, they can still walk and talk, might not even realize what's happened to them, making them the perfect little puppy. You just have to do it right."

"I'm sorry." Dean lowers his eyes. "I remember you showing me, but I can't seem to get it right."

"You're the best student I've ever seen," his master comforts him, taking out the knife and licking clean the blood dripping from the blade with his tongue. "Do you trust me?"

"Of course, Master," Dean answers quickly, looking up.

"And you're having fun?"

"Yes."

The doctor smiles. "Good," then yells at the door's direction. "Next!"

Two nurses open the operation door and dash in, wheeling the passed-out patient out, and another two pushing in the next one cuffed and tied up on the operation table. The screams from other rooms permeate the air in the corridor, passing into the room during the short breaks when the door is opened. Dean hears them, but he's already got used to it.

"How many operations are out there?" he asks, as he turns to the tool table, examining his knives and tools, getting ready for the new operation.

"Hundreds of thousands," the doctor answers simply.

"And all these people," Dean gestures to the new one lying there, who's struggling and crying even louder than the last one, wailing for mercy. "They all deserve it? The operation and the punishment?"

The doctor narrows his black eyes, thinning into a line. "Are you having feelings for them, Dean? Do you prefer to be the one lying there, instead?"

"No," Dean answers hastily, picking up the biggest knife on the table, grabbing its handle tight in his hand, walking toward the frightened patient. One tip of his lips curl up with joy and expectation of what's coming next. "I don't know why I asked that."

He buries the knife into the patient's skull. The crying turns into a desperate painful howl.

Dean watches the blood pour out of the cutting line, smelling the sweet taste of blood suffusing the whole operation room. Light of excitement glints in his black eyes. He grins wider. "Of course, they deserve this, they deserve all the pain. I'm doing them a favor."

He cuts a second time, a deeper line. Half the blade is buried inside the skull before he takes it out. His hands are not shaking.

"How did I do this time, Master Alastair?"

Alastair smiles with a hint of proud. "Attaboy."

Dean enjoys the lobotomy process too much, thinks he's doing the right thing

### Chap 2

> The angels come to rescue, Cas is the first/only angel fights off all the demons outside this pocket-Hell and enters the operation room. Because of the pocket dimension rule, Cas's angel power is suppressed, he's just like a powerless human vessel (forced by the rule, can't fight it). Dean thinks he's just another patient to operate on. Cas tries to reason with him, but rule one of his rescue mission, Dean needs to voluntarily agree to leave the place in order to be saved, but Dean doesn't even realize this is Hell, so he doesn't want to leave, and he just thinks Cas is another patient trying to fight/talk his way out of the operation. He wouldn't allow that.
>
> They fight, Dean is a strong demon, Cas is a bit hold back, doesn't want to hurt the Righteous Man, Dean wins. Dean forces Cas lie down on the operation table, straps him, lobotomizes him. Cas forgets why he's down here, where they are, that he's an angel and he's coming to save Dean, now Cas thinks he's the same as Dean, so he hangs around in the room, wants to be his assistant.

They hear some disturbance outside the door, when Dean is halfway working on the tenth operation of the day -- or maybe the hundred and tenth, he doesn't really know the difference. He's enjoying it way too much to keep a close count. The moves are getting familiar, but there is always something slightly different that makes every single one fresh and intriguing. Alastair would make some comment after he's done with every one of them, helping him improve.

They hear vague sounds of bodies crashing onto the wall, and the crying is more high-pitched.

Dean changes a look with Alastair, slowing down his move in hand.

Alastair gives him a gesture, telling him to stay and keep going, "You okay with finishing this one up without me here?"

"Yes," Dean shifts his eyes back to the opened skull, eying the structure that his blade should aim next, but half of his attention is still distracted by the unusual noise outside the door. He hesitates.

A nurse barges in -- which has never happened before, either. Dean knows Alastair has given them explicit rules of not disturbing them unless they're called. The nurse blinks rapidly, his black eyes showing nothing but panic. "They're here. They --" he can't seem to form a coherent sentence, or make it any clearer about what he's talking about than merely a "they".

Dean wonders what could possibly scare them like this. This is merely a hospital with operations and surgeries. There's no one other than doctors, nurses, and patients that can't move away from the operation beds. Perhaps a patient outbreak?

Alastair shoves the nurse outside the door and steps to the threshold, glancing left and right. The screams and sounds of fighting are louder now, and they sound like moving quickly, getting closer, in their direction.

"Just an outbreak, nothing to worry about," Alastair speaks over his shoulder. "I'll get it settled in two minutes, you stay here."

"Yes, Master." Dean answers, turning his attention back at the patient. The door clicks shut after Alastair leaves.

<br>

His master doesn't come back in two minutes.

Dean finishes up the patient on the operation table, carefully cutting out all the brain tissues like he's taught while ensuring the subject is still wide awake and can feel everything. This one screams louder and longer than the last one. He's getting better at the skills. Dean grins slightly at himself, feeling good. His master praised him being a better artist every day. He wants nothing more than making him proud.

The patient continues the crying for a lingering minute, but eventually the voice wanes down again.

Dean wipes his knife on its skin with some grudge for not making this moment last longer -- he doesn't notice if it's a he or her; they are just patients, nameless, genderless, faceless; they're just all nothing more than subjects that make sounds and feel pain. His master also gave order that he should perfect his skills so that these subjects could feel as much pain as they possibly could, and that's the way to become the best brain surgeon that he's meant to be, so that is exactly what Dean is doing -- practicing day in and day out for the past ten years, trying his best to enjoy every moment of it. He doesn't think about anything else; he doesn't think there is anything else worth thinking about.

Alastair still isn't coming back after he finishes the cleaning. And no nurse comes in even if he tries calling out a "Next" like his master used to do.

Dean is just wondering if he should get outside to check out what's happening, or maybe giving his master a hand if those patients are getting too naughty, when his operation door is crashed open again. A young man stumbles in, looking feeble and lost.

Dean narrows his eyes. The young man has cuts and blood stains on his face and arms; his torn white shirt and trench coat is different from the nurses' coats, which means he can't be a nurse that he's never seen before, which can only mean he's one of those outbreaking patients who happens to run into his chamber. Dean needs to eliminate the danger for the hospital.

He grabs his largest operation knife on the table and steps toward the man.

The young man blinks rapidly after he comes into the room, staring at Dean like his eyes can't focus on him for a second -- or maybe focusing too hard on something he can't see that distracts him. His eyes are different from all the nurses and his master or himself, too, Dean notices. He has different pupils, not black like them, but blue. It only makes him more sure that he's just one of the escaping patients.

"You shouldn't run around like that," Dean tells him, almost sweetly, approaching carefully. He doesn't want him get away and run around again.

"I'm looking for you," the young man answers. His blinking slows down, and now changes to a staring with full attention. "After all this time, we finally reach you, Dean Winchester. You have to leave with me."

Dean takes another small step closer to the man, shaking his head and grinning in a way he hopes it's comforting to the startling patient. "I'm not going anywhere, neither are you." He tilts his head to the operation table without looking. "In fact, why don't you do both of us a favor and lie down there? I promise I'll finish it nice and quick, you wouldn't feel a thing. What do you say?" He grins with his teeth showing.

The young man gives a quick glance at the table behind him, frowning deep. Dean realizes he forgets there's another one lying on there, but it shouldn't be a problem, he can just dump it to the ground. He hopes the cuffs and belts could still be reused.

The man regards him up and down, his frowns deepening, and his voice getting lower. "Dean, you're not in a hospital, this is Hell. You're in Hell. It must be demon's tricks. We're here to save you. I'm Castiel. I'm an Angel of the Lord. We have order to bring you out of Hell, but you have to be willing to leave with us -- with me. Please, come with me. We don't have much time."

Dean isn't affected, continues taking a small step toward the young man who calls himself Castiel. Dean eyes the distance between the man and the door, calculating if he should block the door first or aim to restrain the man's hands first. The man looks a few inches shorter than him, and not very strong, and probably already exhausted from whatever they were doing before in the corridor, judging by his heavy panting and the rising and falling of his chest. He knows he can win the fight easily.

Dean simply smiles at him, telling Castiel, "That's a very nice story you come up with to tell yourself. Certainly better than a patient who needs a surgery to get rid of all the rotten part in your head. But guess what, I'm professional, I'm the best brain surgeon you can get in here. Usually I take appointment, but see, today's your lucky day, I happen to have a vacancy in the schedule before my master comes back. I'll work on you first, what do you say?"

Castiel shakes his sleeves, and a silver blade appears in his palm. But he looks hesitant to raise it. "Please, Dean," he's still speaking in that low, urgent, almost pleading tone. "I don't want to hurt you. My order is to save you."

Dean meets his blue eyes, curving his lips. "That wouldn't be a concern," he says brightly. "The funny thing is, my order is to fix you. I think you just want to talk your way out of the surgery, and I can't allow that."

Dean marches to the man who called himself an angel -- *Who would call themselves angels?* Dean laughs in his mind while his knife striking Castiel in the arms. Castiel raises his blade for defense. The two blades crash into each other, bursting into sparks. The vibration makes the man stumbles back a step, Dean closes the distance in the blink of an eye.

Castiel raises his palms before him, in a way like in those superhero movies that they try to fire some palm cannon. Dean eyes him with some amusement -- this man really takes that angel theory seriously, which only proves him more sick than he thought and definitely in need of the surgery.

Dean grabs his wrists easily and forces him to drop the blade. Castiel yells when Dean twists his wrists outward, dragging him toward the operation table. "Open your eyes, see it, see this is Hell! You need to leave this place. You don't belong here!"

Dean huffs a laugh, telling him, "This is exactly where I belong." He doesn't understand how this man can still insist on his story but he doesn't have time to argue right now. The man doesn't weigh much, but he's struggling violently. Dean doesn't want to have to knock him out -- he'll have to wait for hours for him to come to before starting the operation, he doesn't want to wait.

Dean cuts his hands instead, slicing a shadow line through the palms and all the way to the upper arms, watching small drops of blood forming and seeping from the cut. He rests the surgery blade on the wrist where the man's pulse is beating fast underneath the skin like a panicking rabbit, threatening to cut through it.

"Please, Dean, I don't want to hurt you. I just want to save you." The man is still repeating.

"Quiet!" Dean snaps, "Or I might cut off your hands and feet!"

That successfully makes the man shut up for about two seconds.

He hears Castiel sigh, and then murmur quietly. "I'm sorry we didn't come earlier; I'm sorry you're already a demon now."

This pisses Dean off -- he doesn't need a random dude pop up and sound as if he's better than him, as if he's something bad and corrupted. Dean accelerates his works, holding Castiel's wrists in one hand, opening the cuffs and belts on the operation table with the other. He has to use his teeth to help at one point, but the knots and locks finally give way. He shoves that previous patient off to the ground, not bothering to check if that body is still breathing or not -- it's never their concern.

It takes him even longer than shutting him up to lock Castiel in place on the operation table. But this is not the first violent patient who struggles so much that the whole table moves or tries to fight back or even escape. Dean is strong enough to handle all of them. He forces the man down the desk, tightening the belts around his middle, strapping him in place. All his feet and hands are cuffed, and there's an extra belt around the neck that he tightens it so much that it straddles the man's throat, not leaving an inch to move.

Castiel lies there, can do nothing but blink and pant. But he still keeps his eyes follow Dean. "Deep down, you know I'm right. You didn't forget everything before Hell. Remember Earth, Dean, remember life. You're a hunter, not a doctor."

Fury bubbles up. Dean barks at him. "Yes, I am! You know nothing about me. I'm a doctor all my life! And I'm damn good at it! I'm gonna show you just in a second and you'll know this is the reality! The hospital, the knife, the surgery, this is *my life*, not your angel-demon Heaven-Hell crap!"

He picks the longest, sharpest blade and cuts through the man's head. Blood and a mysterious white-blue light flow out of the wound in a way he never sees before. And that thread of light burns his finger if he touches it. Dean frowns at the man, confused, but he refuses to stop. At the end of the day, the man is still just his patient, and the body is all just biology. His fingers already have the muscle memory to go through all the cutting and motions while his mind wanders around to think about what that light can possibly be, and that Castiel looks truly different from any patient he's worked on. His head starts getting excited about the idea that this man might be a whole new different experiment subject for him.

Castiel starts screaming. The sound is sharper and higher-pitched than any of the hundreds that he's done before. The voice reaches Dean like a real physical blade, cutting through his skin and reaching somewhere deep down in him, but he can't quite figure out. Dean ignores it.

The pain is so vivid and sharp within that sound, and so Dean laughs. He feels his mouth open and laughter comes out of him, getting louder and huskier, as if trying to cover the sound of scream. He thinks that bubbling feeling inside his chest must be an ecstasy that is so much stronger than joy that he's feeling unfamiliar with. He thinks he feels happy for operating the most successfully in his whole career because he's causing this patient the most pain -- his master would be proud if he's here.

Dean tries not to ruin his joy so he cuts carefully. Once the skull is opened, he switches to the precision blade, cutting through the brain tissues like Alastair showed him before, reaching deep and precisely to cut out the part that should remove the memories but keep the feelings and sensations intact. He remembers his master mentioned, if he's doing it right, the patient can even walk and talk once he's done. He wonders if this can be his first successful patient.

Castiel never stops screaming, not even after Dean thinks he's done with the job. He even bothers himself to sew the skull and skin back -- he's just curious to see how this subject would perform. His hands are completely soaked with the man's blood when he's done.

Castiel is still conscious and breathing, yelling something unrecognizable.

Dean wipes his blades and hands, regarding him with a slight amusement and a huge achievement. He can't believe he did it.

"How you feel?" Dean asks him, using the already bloodied dirty rug to wipe the blood off his face, just to see how his own work come out to be.

The screaming recedes slowly, long and labored, the sound getting dryer as time goes by.

Dean waits for a few more patient moments.

The unintelligible sound is getting more and more clear slowly.

He's calling "Dean," Dean realizes. He frowns. The man who called himself an angel is crying Dean's name over and over again during the whole operation. It doesn't make sense, but he decides not to think about that for now.

Dean waves a hand before his eyes, catching his attention. "Hey, you hear me? How you feel?"

Castiel blinks slowly, eyes following his movement tiredly. "Pain," he croaks out.

"Yeah, that's normal," Dean nods, reassuring. "What else do you remember? Your name, for example?"

The man's eyes drift around the ceiling, straying purposelessly for a short while before focusing back onto his face. He shakes his head. "I don't know," he says cluelessly.

"Anything else you remember? Those bullshits you were talking about when you came in here?" Dean studies him closely, trying to catch any sign that the man is pretending, but he doesn't find any.

The man shakes his head again. "I don't know," he says again, blankly. "Who am I?" he asks Dean, instead. Glancing at Dean's white doctor's coat, he asks, "Am I a doctor, like you?"

Dean huffs a loud laugh, genuinely amused. That's a first. He doesn't remember when's the last time he's truly laughing out of something funny, and this guy managed it.

"No, you're not." Dean tells him, unlocking his cuffs and the strap around his throat slowly, waiting to see how he'd behave. "You were a patient. But now you're fixed."

The man rubs his wrists slowly, thinking. "Can I be one like you, then?" he asks next. "Stay here, learn this. I'd like to be like you."

Dean raises his eyebrows. He can use a company like him. Life with only his master is a little monotonous, even counting all the fun from operations and lessons. He can use an assistant, or student, or something. He hopes his master wouldn't object.

"Sure, why not?" Dean agrees, untying the rest of the locks, giving the door a quick glance.

But the man doesn't seem to even notice the door or realize escaping is even a possibility. He takes a minute to wait for his feet to have feeling again and stumbles down the operation table. Looking up at Dean, he asks, "What's my name?"

"Cas--" Dean is about to say "Castiel", the name the man came with, but he swallows the rest of the syllables, thinking might as well keep it simple and short, something made up by him like a mark of his, so he says instead, "That's it, that's your name. Cas."

"Cas," the man chews the name between his teeth and tongue for a few times, as if a kid learning a new vocabulary, learning the combination of the syllables and sounds. "Cas. I'm Cas," he announces, pleased and joyful, also like a kid. "I like it. Thank you, Dean."

Dean laughs again, feeling a small fluffy sensation somewhere inside his chest. He rubs his chest to ease it and ignores it.

"Yeah, okay, no problem," he turns around, hiding his face, moving over to the table to grab an extra blade. He forgets to ask how come Cas can still remember Dean's name after the operation, how come that's the only thing he remembers, not even his own name.

Dean stuffs the handle of the blade into Cas's hands.

"You said you want to learn, then let's start the class. We got a body right here."

#### draft notes

Cas forgets why he's down here, where they are, that he's an angel and he's coming to save Dean, now Cas thinks he's the same as Dean, so he hangs around in the room, wants to be his assistant.

### Chap 3

> Cas without memory/knowledge, is a slow learner, but willing to learn, instinctively clingy to Dean (angel base code is still there, muscle memory knows he needs to get Dean out of there, at least make sure Dean's safe). Cas for the first time picks up operation tools, operates on others like Dean shows him. Dean starts to get interested in him (though initially thinks he's just weird and need punish), fond of him, starts trusting him.
>
> Demons know Cas is angel, comes in (in human form), tries to take Cas away, Dean instinctively protects Cas, views demons as threats, protects Cas, kills demons.
>
> Alastair (in doctor director costume) comes in to try to take Cas away, or try to kill him on sight. Dean doesn't want, tries to get in the way, but still hesitant of fighting against father figure. Alastair commands Dean to kill Cas, or he'd be disappointed at him (more father figure authority), Dean hesitates, acts as if intends to kill Cas (Cas frightens) but ends up didn't. Instead, Dean rebels against Alastair, leaves the operation room and takes Cas with him to outside, sees the real Hell, shocked, remembers he's a demon. Cas remembers he has wings (reminded by Dean, Dean believes what he said before lobotomy is true now, retells him what he initially said), uses wings to protect Dean.

Cas doesn't seem to know or remember anything about any operations or even how to use a knife, but he's willing to learn. Dean teaches him from the basics: how to hold the blade, how to stand, how to get ready. His eyes follow Dean's every move with intensity, and copies his moves.

Both of them forget about the noise outside the door in the corridor.

There's something in his eyes that still disturbs Dean -- he can't quite put a finger on what, maybe it's the color of his eyes, maybe it's the way he looks at him, maybe it's just because he's dorky little weird guy. Dean finds it uncomfortable to run directly into Cas's eyes, as if something in his eyes can crawl out and reach deep into him, but he also can't stop himself from staring at him from time to time. It makes him a little restless. He just wants to figure him out a little more. They just need a little bit more time.

Dean stands behind Cas, wraps his hand over his, holding the scalpel together.

Cas's body is tense, his move stiff, but Dean guides him.

They stand so close that Dean can feel Cas's body warmth radiating from his back against his chest. He leans in, his breath huffing into Cas's neck. He's satisfied to see Cas doesn't try to dodge away.

Dean uses his gloved left hand to point at a small corner of the brain tissue that appears more greyish than the rest.

"See that? If you cut right through it, you'll get a huge scream, the best kind." Dean leads his hand forward, cutting that structure open. The body on the operation table twitches and shivers like going through a spasm, the scream is satisfyingly loud and shrieking.

Dean grins, lets go of Cas's hand. "Now, you try it yourself."

Cas glances at the face of the body, frowning slightly. He swallows, glances at Dean with uncertainty, then looks back at the opened skull. Dean thought he might raise some silly questions, or maybe even protests, saying something like "This isn't right." But Cas merely nods obediently, and cuts through the brain as he's told.

The blade doesn't land in the right spot, and the body doesn't twitch as violently as before, only with a quiet moaning of pain. But it's a good start.

But Dean pats his shoulder. "You're doing great. Just need some practice." Like he used to be told by his master. Cas nods small, seems pleased to hear his approval.

So they continues to practice some more.

When that patient finally, completely stops moving or breathing, which is also when there isn't any more brain to be cut, the door is burst open. Four nurses rush in, each holding a long, sharp, black blade, pointing at Cas.

"He's here!" One of them calls out. "I knew him run in here! Dean's room!"

Dean can hear more footsteps coming this way, following his yelling.

Meanwhile, Cas shivers, saying in a higher pitch than usual, "Their faces! What's happening to their faces!"

Dean studies their faces but can't see anything wrong. He holds his scalpel closer, eyeing the blade in their hands. These look more like weapons than surgery tools to him. He takes a step forward, standing before the nurses and Cas, before fully thinking about what he's doing.

"What's happening to us?" another nurse sneers, glancing between Dean and Cas, edging closer to Dean. "What happened to you? What happened to *him*?"

Dean shoots a glance back at Cas, seeing him also raising a blade like Dean taught him, eyes locking on the nurses. He almost forgets about the surgery he operated on him.

"I took him in as my patient." Dean turns back to the nurses, announcing. "And now he's fully functional, and I'm taking him as my apprentice."

"You what?" Alastair walks behind them, folding his hands behind his back like he's just examining.

Dean is more than happy to see him and show off his achievement. "Master, I finally made it! The lobotomy! Look at him, he doesn't remember, but he can still function and feel pain. Isn't that what we always try to do?"

Alastair bursts out a huge wave of laughter. "You lobotomized *him*?"

Dean blinks, unsure if he's being mocked or affirmed. He answers, feeling a little dumb. "Yes, Master. I thought it's the right thing to do. And now I want to study him more, so I took him as my student, teaching him what I learned from you."

He glances at Cas again, seeing him tilt his heads, shifting his eyes between his master and him. Dean doesn't have time to wonder what might be going through Cas's head.

It takes a long while for Alastair to stop the laugh. He's almost a little out of breath. When he finally calms down, he lands a hand on Dean's shoulder. "This is probably the best thing you've ever done, and you don't even have any idea what that means."

"What does that mean?" Dean asks immediately.

Alastair simply shakes his head. "Don't worry about it." He gives the nurses a wave of hand, gesturing to Cas. "Take him away."

Dean gets away from Alastair's grip on the shoulder, taking a step closer to Cas, standing right between him and the nurses. "No," he tells them. "You're not taking him away."

Alastair narrows his eyes, displeased. Dean feels uneasy and almost ashamed just being stared by his disapproving eyes.

"What do you mean, 'No'?" Alastair asks slowly, stretching his voice long and twisted, winding the air like a palpable snake.

Dean glances behind his shoulder again, running into Cas's helpless eyes. He swallows. "He's *my* apprentice. You're not taking him away."

"Are you disobeying me, boy?" Alastair takes a step toward him, raising a hand in a choking gesture. Dean feels his throat tightened.

He lowers his eyes, like he's so used to, like his body knows exactly what to do or how to react to minimize the following pain. "No, Sir," he answers quietly.

"Good," Alastair regards him, waving at the nurses once again. "Kill the petty little flying thing there."

The nurses start surround them.

"Dean --" Cas calls him, low and urgent. Panicked.

Dean's eyes shift between Alastair and Cas. Then the nurses and the blades in their hands. Then back to Cas.

Cas takes a step closer to Dean, almost right by his side. His hand that holds the scalpel is shaking. His other hand touches the cutting line on his forehead that Dean cut through and sewed up for him. He closes his eyes for a brief moment, as if enduring something happening in his head that he doesn't want to handle.

Dean swallows violently. It doesn't make sense. Dean thinks frantically. He shouldn't *want* to save him. But truth is, he does. He really does. He knows Cas is different and special from the first sight. He *wants* to keep him close, keep him alive. But it just doesn't make sense.

He clenches his hands into fists, holding his feet still. He shouldn't fight against Alastair, he knows he shouldn't.

A flashback of screams and bloody red scenes flashes before his eyes. He remembers that's his own screams, his own crying. What was he screaming about? When was that?

"So Dean? What's it gonna be? This little thing you met for less than an hour and knew nothing about, or us? The familiar people who you know and familiar with for eternity? Practically your family?" Alastair watches his face with great interest.

The circle around them shrinks smaller, from all four directions.

Dean's fists loosen once, and clench again.

Cas takes another step, his back pressing onto Dean's. No more room for him to hide.

Dean sees the frantic but also still a tad blank look in his eyes.

*I'm Castiel. I'm an Angel of the Lord.* He was so much more fierce and determined when he first barged in, until Dean made him different.

*I don't want to hurt you. I'm here to save you.* He raised his blade, but instead of stabbing toward Dean, he merely used it for defense. He could have escaped, or at least protect himself, but for Dean, this is what he's become.

*We have order to bring you out of Hell, but you have to be willing to leave with us -- with me. Please, come with me.* That's about when Dean tied him up and cut him open, making him forget even his own name. But not Dean's name.

What if he was telling the truth?

What if this *is* Hell?

Which makes them demons.

Dean narrows his eyes at the nurses, squinting at their white nurse coat-covered bodies and faces. Dark shape shakes underneath the skin, showing a different face, a darker shadow like flowing smoke contained inside a vessel.

He turns to Cas, and finds nothing but light. Light swirls inside his body, swimming like it has a life of its own. Light that is so much more smooth and larger than the skin, that it spreads out behind Cas's back, but folded like wings not in use. He remembers the light bleeding out from the wound when he cut Cas's skull open. He remembers it burned his finger when he touched it -- because it's too hot, because it's too holy for him, because it's from the sky and celestial, because that's what true and real Cas is like -- now he understands.

*Cas really is an Angel of the Lord.* Dean gasps with realization.

Alastair grins. "I see your stubborn mind is coming through."

Dean smiles back at him, pleased to know Alastair must have taken his gasp in a whole different way, a wrong way.

Alastair snaps his fingers, catching the attention of other nurses -- other demons. "Lads, what you doing? We don't have all day here. Finish him off. He doesn't remember anything anyway -- credit to our little hero Doctor Dean. How difficult can it be now?"

The demons launch the attack, and at the very same time, Dean raises his blade, standing back to back with Cas.

Dean's blade crashes into that of one of the demons', and he twists it in his hand, making the demon drop his knife. He kicks it in the chest, and the demon flies across the room and crashes into the wall.

"Dean?" Cas raises his voice, surprised. But he's too busy handling the other demon right in front of him to turn to glance at Dean.

"You might say I just figured out something," Dean yells back, as he stabs the blade into the chest of the second demon, and flies its loose weapon toward the third one, pinning it into its forehead. "I might have some apologies to say, but later."

He swirls to the back of the fourth one, holding its arms still with his bare hands, letting Cas strikes the killing blow. Golden light burns inside the demon before its body drops slump. The air smells of sulfur and burned ash, now that he pays attention.

Dean drops its body onto the floor, wiping his dirtied hands on his doctor's coat, cleaning the blood and black ashes.

"What a sweet little surprise," Alastair watches them, tutting loudly. "Guess it's just about time for some reminder. I'll book your next appointment, Dean. Remember all the fun we had last time? With all the poking and probing? It's time for you to be my patient again."

He holds out a hand, choking Dean on the throat, pushing him to the wall.

Dean struggles but drops his blade. He feels his feet leave the floor, and his breathing is quickly tightened. Blackness crawls from the edge of his eyesight, he sees Cas move behind Alastair, that's when air pumps into his lungs again.

Alastair stumbles back a step, reaching an arm behind his back. Cas lets go of the handle, and Dean sees it's the big surgical scissors that he stabbed onto Alastair's back.

"Nice team work!" Dean can't help grinning at him.

Cas grins back.

Alastair lets out a yell, and the scissors retract from his back automatically. The look on his face turns murderous.

"Alright, time to go!" Dean jumps to his feet, dragging Cas's sleeves, rushing toward the door.

The hospital corridor morphs away the moment he steps out. Instead, they are greeted by a dark wild field, flooded with sound of screaming and yelling of pain. Thick black smoke flies above their heads, mixed with thin threads of white light; skeletons and skulls scatter on the ground everywhere, layers after layers, their hollow eye sockets aiming upward. The air smells blood and sulfur, so thick that it feels like a crust on their skin.

The only thing Dean has in mind is:

*Welcome to Hell.*

<br>

#### draft notes

sees the real Hell, shocked, remembers he's a demon. Cas remembers he has wings (reminded by Dean, Dean believes what he said before lobotomy is true now, retells him what he initially said), uses wings to protect Dean.

Cas listen to any of Dean's orders, instinctively clingy to Dean (angel base code is still there, muscle memory knows he needs to get Dean out of there, at least make sure Dean's safe).

Dean starts to get interested in him (though initially thinks he's just weird), fond of him, starts trusting him.

### Chap 4

> Demons attack, more angels are high up but can't come down (including Balthazar?). Cas purely muscle memory fights (still vessel shape, still doesn't remember other things before lobotomy, not remember why they need to save Dean but he finds his own motivation/reason already, doesn't need to know it's mission). Cas uses wings to protect Dean, demon Dean can see Cas's wings, demon Dean helps Cas in fighting other demons and gets both of them out of there. Cas's palm on Dean's shoulder (burns Dean, Dean yells in pain), and flies Dean out of Hell ("Dean Winchester is saved"), a parting scene. Cas rebuilds Dean's body and buries him in the field (wipes himself from Dean's Hell memory, ashamed of himself, feel like he's doing lobotomy to Dean again).
>
> Cas goes back to Heaven to regain a copy of memory (backuped before going down to Hell/standard version for all angels) from Naomi (hint potential memory messed up again), goes back in time to meet Dean in the barn again. Both don't remember the time in Hell together, but feel familiar. Canon compliant.

Dean lets go of Cas's hands, stumbles on the field, and gets tripped over by a skull. He kneels down where he fell, his fingers digging into the ashes underneath him. Memory of Hell rushes into his head.

He's not a brain surgeon doctor. He didn't do surgeries for ten years, perfecting his skills in lobotomy.

He's a demon. A demon living in Hell. For more than forty years.

He remembers his own screaming and the pain and torture and skinning when Alastair operates on him. He remembers when he couldn't take it any more and got off the hook, picking up the first razor. He remembers Alastair's wide grin and sweet tone.

Oh God, he's a demon. And there's an angel standing right beside him, not remembering himself, because of him.

Cas stands quietly beside him, still holding his silvery blade.

Dean closes his eyes. It's so messed up. What has him done?

Cas puts a hand on his shoulder, and Dean shivers at the contact. But the touch isn't to kill him, like he expected it to be.

"We have to go, Dean." Cas says quietly. "They're coming for you."

Dean looks up. Cas is right, the black smokes are flying in their directions.

"Where?" Dean asks, voice hoarse. The field is wild and barren, nowhere to hide. Whichever direction they run, the demons will catch up in a blink. "You said you don't belong to here. But I think this is exactly where I belong."

He looks up, facing the angel, feeling that odd sensation in his chest shifting and floating again, like a wave flapping on the sand. He remembers the sea and the beach on the Earth now.

But he blinks, and he knows his eyes are still black. "Where to, Cas?" Dean's lips tremble. "You said you're here to save me, but I don't think I can go anywhere."

Cas pulls him up from the kneeling position, looking at him in the eyes, not discouraged by whatever color his eyes are. "I don't remember anything," he says. "So you'll have to tell me exactly what I said when I met you."

So Dean tells him. Those things he didn't believe when he heard it, the angels, Heaven, some orders from Upstairs, and then, specifically, the saving part.

"You said I'll have to be willing to leave with you," Dean swallows. "I do now. If it's not too late."

Cas nods quietly. "It's never too late."

"I'm sorry, Cas," Dean finishes, averting his eyes, can't bear to look at the angel's blue eyes anymore. "For what I did to you. But I'm a demon, what else do you expect?" The excuse almost makes him feel better, but the tightness in his chest doesn't release. Something inside his chest has always been out of his control, and he still hasn't got the faintest clue what's happening in there. And what's worse, he thinks that part is growing, he can feel it.

Cas catches his gaze again easily. "I knew the risk of the mission. It's not your fault. We only have to figure out how to leave here. I wish I could still remember the original retreating plan after making contact."

He glances upward, and Dean follows his eyes. Dean can almost make out the shape of the flying angels in the mid-air. Their lights blink like candles in a storm night, flickering weakly between all the black smokes. It looks like many of them are still trying to descend, to approach them, but none of them are able to break through demons' barricade -- apparently none other than Castiel. Dean can's help wonder what makes Cas so special, or strong, or both.

"Do you have wings?" Dean asks suddenly, glancing behind the angel's back.

Cas tilts his head, concentrating on the idea. Dean watches the light folded behind his body's back spreads, like a giant thunderbird or phoenix suddenly bursts into life, extending the wings made of lightning high and wide, full of light and electricity. The air stirred by his wings form into a gust, pushing the dirt and skeletons away, cleaning out a circle of bare ground. The light and sound cracks open the air, shaking the ground.

This is the most beautiful thing Dean's ever seen in his whole life, on Earth or in Hell. He thinks he stops breathing for a moment, just to stare at Cas -- at the light that's swirling faster under his skin, at the light that's stretching out, at the white blue color, at the burning warmth. He thinks his eyes might get burned for staring too long, but he doesn't care.

Dean doesn't need to look up to know the demons must have found them -- if they didn't before, with the light show Cas just did, they certain do now.

"Shit, I don't know it's so high profile." Dean curses, scanning around. The forever-dark sky is getting even darker, the black cloud made of flying demon smoke pressing down on them fast. The smell of sulfur grows stronger.

"Think you can get us through that?" Dean asks.

"I'll try. I'll die trying." Cas answers easily, holding out a hand to grab Dean on the shoulder. "If I fail, I wish my brothers and sisters will find you."

Dean doesn't have time to answer to that as Cas's wings flap, and they're no longer on the lowest ground of the Pit of Hell.

The flapping wings stir up the flow of the air, along with the demons flying in there, swirling everything into a maelstrom. Dean feels nauseous, as if all his insides are crashed into one side inside his stomach. He has to use one hand to hold on to the angel's waist to keep himself steady.

The demons are getting closer.

The way up takes longer than Dean thought or hoped for. Cas flies fast, but not fast enough to pass all the demons that are already waiting for them.

They crash into the black cloud in the sky of Hell.

Demons' shrieking laughter replaces the tortured souls' screaming, filling his ears. Their claws extend from the smoke, reaching out to him, pulling his arms and legs, dragging them down. Dean can feel his skin and flesh crack open under their tearing, his body slipping slowly from the angel's grip.

Castiel growls -- Dean doesn't realize it's angel's voice at first, thinking it's a thunder that rolls from the above, but he sees nothing and no one else. Only Cas's outrageous face.

The angel uses the right side of his wings to close tightly around Dean, wrapping him like a cocoon, swinging the left wing at the demons like a blade. The lack of balance makes their flight bank suddenly to one side, crashing into the wall of demons. Dean knows before he sees Cas's wings are being torn by the demons.

"Let me help!" He yells to the angel, turning slightly in his clinging posture. His left arm is still circling around the angel's middle, his right hand holding the blade. "I can fight!"

The right wing starts showing fractures between the feathers made of light. Cas roars louder. Dean doesn't know if it's more about pain or rage. He waves his arm through the fracture, slicing the blade through the smoke. Demons retreat from where his blade reaches.

Only then does he notice light are escaping from Cas's left side. He can't see the cut, but he knows it must be the same as the wound when *he* cut open the angel. Demons that are touched by those bleeding light scream in pain and recoil like burnt. Their paths are slowly cleared.

"You're hurt." Dean tries to turn, to examine, to help. The wing holds him tight, limiting his move.

"Don't mind me," Cas answers from above his head, his voice weakened, but the speed of the wings whipping is not slowed. "We're almost there."

Dean can feel the hand on his shoulder tightened, a slow burning sensation pooling into the place they touch. A thin stream of bleeding light flows along Cas's arm, gathering to his right palm. The heat grows sharper quickly, and Dean thinks his skin on his left shoulder must be torched, but he grits his teeth, swallowing any moaning sound, not wanting to distract the angel. They have enough things to worry about.

It still takes way too long to change "almost there" to "really out". Even Dean can tell Castiel's wings are labored, their moves getting slower, more sluggish, each flapping heavy and strained. But there are less demons the higher they get to. The sky no longer looks dark -- it's almost like sun rise. It turns from pure dark to light grey, then a thin blue, and then even brighter, closer to blue-pink.

Cas makes one final scowl, and they push through the final gate of Hell. The real sky on Earth envelops above their heads, showing a thin white-grey of early morning. The woods near them are all burned in the instant they emerge out of the ground, blasted outward. Dean doesn't have time to care about where they are, because Cas loosens his grip and crashes down on the ground.

"Cas!" Dean rushes to him, ignoring the throbbing pain from all the cuts and slices in his own body. The angel lies with his wings spread lifelessly behind him, torn and bloody, not moving an inch.

Cas opens his eyes with a scowl when Dean slaps his face. He grumbles, and the first sentence coming out is, "Dean Winchester is saved."

Dean blinks, sitting down next to him with a tight, relieved huff. The tumbling sensation in his chest is so strong that Dean thinks it must have something to do with him coming back to the Earth now. But that brief second of relief after the rescue dies down quickly, replaced by pain and guilt.

"Why?" he asks quietly, glancing at the wounds on Cas's body. The light of the angel dims quickly in his eyes, he can barely see his wings now. The burning sensation on his shoulder is also easing down. "Why would an angel save me? Almost sacrifice yourself to save a demon?"

Cas lets his hand slide from Dean's shoulder, examining his face as if he's searching for something. "If I remember, I'll let you know," he answers, not unkindly.

Dean frowns at him. "I thought... your memory must be back somehow. How else could you fight like that?"

Cas shakes his head. "It's not memory, it's instinct. Humans might call it muscle memory. I still don't remember anything before meeting you."

"You don't even remember why you have to save me." Dean says. It's a statement, but the unasked question lies right underneath.

"I don't need to," Cas answers easily. "Seeing you is the first thing I remember, but not the only thing. Anyone sees a soul so bright, so beautiful like yours, they'll know." He raises a hand, pointing at Dean's heart. "You didn't lose that, even when you were a demon."

"Were?" Dean notices, widening his eyes.

The angel smiles at him. "My grace on you, it's purifying you. I'm sorry it burns."

Dean's right hand automatically covers the burned flesh on his left shoulder. Cas nods slightly. "It has to find a place to enter."
