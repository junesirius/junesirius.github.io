### Idea

**S04E01 Dean lobotomize Cas in Hell during angel rescue**

(inspired by a comment under my tumblr post mentioning Cas 0817 is lobotomized) (heavy angst, canon divergent)

start scene as if normal hospital operation scene, Dean enter in Doctor coat, acting operation on patient, they scream, turn out it's lobotomy, Dean enjoys the process and thinks he's doing the right thing (write in a way as if it's just a Doctor AU, but actually canon-divergent; unnoticeably showing Alastair & Dean interaction, Dean trusts him, Alastair showing him tricks and Dean outskills him, Alastair=father figure)

turn out this is in Hell, except not even Dean realizes that, he thinks he's doing the right thing, those people need that, so he's doing that to them, he knows it's causing them pain, but he thinks it's a good thing, he feels good about himself (calm tone, not angsty, easy at torturing); when some patient fight back, he constrain them with force, still think it's what's best for them

(the visual of pocket room of Hell, everyone's individual Hell: inspired by *Lucifer*)

then angels come to rescue, Cas is the first/only angel fights off all the demons outside his pocket-Hell and enter the operation room, get force transformed into human vessel form in there, Dean thinks he's just another soul to operate on, Cas try to reason with him, but rule one of save, Dean needs to agree to leave to be saved, but Dean doesn't even realize this is Hell so he wouldn't want to leave, and he just thinks Cas is another patient trying to fight/talk his way out; Dean force Cas down (win their fight, cuz Cas hold back, doesn't want to hurt the Righteous Man) to the operation table, lobotomize Cas, Cas forget why he's down here, that he's an angel and he's coming to save Dean, now Cas thinks he's same as Dean so hang around in the room, be his assistant

Cas without memory/knowledge, slow learner, but pick up the tools, operate on others like Dean show him, Dean start to get interested in him (though initially think he's just weird and need punish), fond of him, start trusting him; demons know he's angel, come in (in human form) try to take Cas away, Dean instinctively protect Cas, kill demons

Alastair (in doctor director costume) come in to try to take Cas away/kill him on sight, Dean doesn't let him, Alastair commands Dean kill Cas or he'd be disappointed at him (father figure), Dean hesitates, acts as if intend to kill Cas (Cas frightened) but ends up didn't, instead rebels to Alastair, leaves the operation room and takes Cas with him to outside, see real Hell, shocked, Cas remembers he has wing (reminded by Balthazar?/Dean, Dean believes what he said before lobotomy is true now, tell him back what he initially said), use wing to protect Dean (demon Dean can see Cas's wings), demons attack, Cas purely muscle memory fight (still vessel shape, still doesn't remember other things before lobotomy), hand on Dean's shoulder (burns Dean, yell) and flies him out ("Dean Winchester is saved"), remakes him

Cas go back to heaven to regain a copy of memory (backuped before fight/standard version for all angels) from Naomi (hint potential memory messed up again), back in time to meet Dean in barn again, canon compliant

### Outline

(S04E01 demon!Dean lobotomizes angel!Cas in Hell during angel rescue)

Starts as if normal hospital operation scene, almost like AU, Dean enters the operation room in doctor's white robe (with some blood stains), acting operation on patients. They scream, turn out it's lobotomy. Dean enjoys the process too much, thinks he's doing the right thing (write in a way as if it's just a doctor AU, but actually canon-divergent in Hell).

Alastair comes in to inspect, interacts with Dean naturally (like S04E17 *It's a terrible life* Zachariah), Dean trusts him (like father figure), Alastair shows him some tricks, Dean learns very quickly and outskills him.

Turns out this is in Hell, except not even Dean realizes that, his memory/thinking is messed up/wiped regularly too, partially manipulated but the operating part is his own voluntary actions. He genuinely believes he's a doctor, doing the right thing, those people need that, so he's doing the operation on them. He knows it's causing them pain, but he thinks it's a good thing, he feels good about himself (calm tone, not angsty, easy at torturing, very good at it). Some patients fight back, he constrains them with force, retaliates in operation, tortures them harder, they scream loud, Dean still thinks it's what's best for them.

The angels come to rescue, Cas is the first/only angel fights off all the demons outside this pocket-Hell and enters the operation room. Because of the pocket dimension rule, Cas's angel power is suppressed, he's just like a powerless human vessel (forced by the rule, can't fight it). Dean thinks he's just another patient to operate on. Cas tries to reason with him, but rule one of his rescue mission, Dean needs to voluntarily agree to leave the place in order to be saved, but Dean doesn't even realize this is Hell, so he doesn't want to leave, and he just thinks Cas is another patient trying to fight/talk his way out of the operation. He wouldn't allow that.

They fight, Dean is a strong demon, Cas is a bit hold back, doesn't want to hurt the Righteous Man, Dean wins. Dean forces Cas lie down on the operation table, straps him, lobotomizes him. Cas forgets why he's down here, where they are, that he's an angel and he's coming to save Dean, now Cas thinks he's the same as Dean, so he hangs around in the room, wants to be his assistant.

Cas without memory/knowledge, is a slow learner, but willing to learn, instinctively clingy to Dean (angel base code is still there, muscle memory knows he needs to get Dean out of there, at least make sure Dean's safe). Cas for the first time picks up operation tools, operates on others like Dean shows him. Dean starts to get interested in him (though initially thinks he's just weird and need punish), fond of him, starts trusting him.

Demons know Cas is angel, comes in (in human form), tries to take Cas away, Dean instinctively protects Cas, views demons as threats, protects Cas, kills demons.

Alastair (in doctor director costume) comes in to try to take Cas away, or try to kill him on sight. Dean doesn't want, tries to get in the way, but still hesitant of fighting against father figure. Alastair commands Dean to kill Cas, or he'd be disappointed at him (more father figure authority), Dean hesitates, acts as if intends to kill Cas (Cas frightens) but ends up didn't. Instead, Dean rebels against Alastair, leaves the operation room and takes Cas with him to outside, sees the real Hell, shocked, remembers he's a demon. Cas remembers he has wings (reminded by Dean, Dean believes what he said before lobotomy is true now, retells him what he initially said), uses wings to protect Dean.

Demons attack, more angels are high up but can't come down (including Balthazar?). Cas purely muscle memory fights (still vessel shape, still doesn't remember other things before lobotomy, not remember why they need to save Dean but he finds his own motivation/reason already, doesn't need to know it's mission). Cas uses wings to protect Dean, demon Dean can see Cas's wings, demon Dean helps Cas in fighting other demons and gets both of them out of there. Cas's palm on Dean's shoulder (burns Dean, Dean yells in pain), and flies Dean out of Hell ("Dean Winchester is saved"), a parting scene. Cas rebuilds Dean's body and buries him in the field (wipes himself from Dean's Hell memory, ashamed of himself, feel like he's doing lobotomy to Dean again).

Cas goes back to Heaven to regain a copy of memory (backuped before going down to Hell/standard version for all angels) from Naomi (hint potential memory messed up again), goes back in time to meet Dean in the barn again. Both don't remember the time in Hell together, but feel familiar. Canon compliant.

"Your skills have improved, Dean." The doctor inspects the patient lying on the operation table, as Dean wipes his blade on his coat. The white gown has turned to mostly red, with all the blood splashing on it.

"I still have much to learn, Master," Dean answers, turning back with a smaller precision knife.

"You just need some more practice, that's all. You only did it for ten years, give it another ten years, you'll be as good as me." The doctor pats his shoulder encouragingly, pointing at the edge of the patient's head. "See there? You still hesitated when you cut in, distracted by their crying. You need to focus. When you operate on them, you can't think about how they feel, you have to finish your job. In fact, the more they scream, the more effective your work is, it means you're doing good."

"Yes, Master." Dean answers obediently, studying the patient's half-cut skull and the flesh and liquid dripping out that used to be part of the brain.

"Go on, continue. You know what's next -- cut out their brain. Lobotomy is always the best part." His master urges, standing next to the table with folded arms.

The patient is crying some nonsense, cursing them, calling them demons, screaming non-stoppingly. Dean knows he has to hurry, or the patient will just pass out in pain -- it will be useless to operate without them feel anything, according to the doctor.

He cuts into the opened skull, all the way through the brain material, watching the blood and flesh split apart under his knife. The patient twitches on the operation table involuntarily, until slowly the move dies down and the scream quiets.

Dean glances at his master nervously. "Is it too deep?"

The doctor rounds to his side of the table, speculating the cut he just made, taking over his knife. He gestures for Dean to look closer, and cuts into the brain himself. New blood streams down his hand.

"If you cut two inches to the left, stabbing in right through here," he instructs while operated. "This can cut out most of the memory, but leaves the emotions and pains still sensitive. So they won't remember who they are, what they're doing, or anything at all, but they'll still feel it. They won't pass out yet. In fact, if you patch their skull back up, they can still walk and talk, might not even realize what's happened to them."

"I'm sorry." Dean lowers his eyes. "I remember you showing me, but I can't seem to get it right."

"You're the best student I've ever seen," his master comforts him, taking out the knife and licking clean the blood dripping from the blade. "Do you trust me?"

"Of course, Master," Dean answers quickly, looking up.

"And you're having fun?"

"Yes."

The doctor smiles. "Good," then yells at the door's direction. "Next!"

Two nurses open the operation door and dash in, wheeling the passed-out patient out, and another two pushing in the next one cuffed and tied up on the operation table. The screams from other rooms permeate the air in the corridor, passing into the room during the short breaks when the door is opened. Dean hears them, but he's already got used to it.

"How many operations are out there?" he asks, as he turns to the tool table, examining his knifes and tools, getting ready for the new operation.

"Hundreds of thousands," the doctor answers simply.

"And all these people," Dean gestures to the new one lying there, who's struggling and crying even louder than the last one, wailing for mercy. "They all deserve it? The operation and the punishment?"

The doctor narrows his black eyes, thinning into a line. "Are you having feelings for them, Dean? Do you want to be the one lying there?"

"No," Dean answers hastily, picking up the biggest knife on the table, grabbing its handle tight in his hand, walking toward the frightened patient. One tip of his lips curl up with joy and expectation of what's coming next. "I don't know why I asked that."

He buries the knife into the patient's skull. The crying turns into a desperate painful howl.

Dean watches the blood pour out of the cutting line, smelling the sweet taste of blood suffusing the whole operation room. Light of excitement glints in his black eyes. He grins wider. "Of course they deserve this, they deserve all the pain. I'm doing them a favor."

He cuts a second deep line. Half the blade is buried inside the skull before he takes it out. His hands are not shaking.

"How did I do this time, Master Alastair?"

Alastair smiles with proud. "Attaboy."

Dean enjoys the lobotomy process too much, thinks he's doing the right thing

Alastair shows him some tricks, Dean learns very quickly and outskills him.
