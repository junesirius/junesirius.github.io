> Dean forgetting about Castiel having angelic super strength until he uses it for something - like pulling a locked door fully off its hinges when they haven't got time to pick the lock, holding up one end of Baby so Dean can change a flat tire while they're on the road etc etc and Dean just bluescreens behind his eyes, stands and stares, breathless

Hear me out, what about, instead of Dean forgetting about Cas's super strength, we have Dean remembering it too well and overusing it, to the extent it gets Cas fed up.

Remember that episode he waves Cas over and asks him "Can you lift this?" (S08E08) Cas is like, rolls his eyes and gets like all fed up. He's an angel but just lets Dean wave him over here and there and make use of his strength to do all kinds of small things to make the hunting easier.

Imagine just Dean getting too used to have Cas around to help with all the heavy-lifting, then one day just for some mundane reason Cas is out doing something else when Dean wants to ask him to help with something and realizes Cas's not there, and that's when it hits Dean how much he's used to Cas being super powerful angel and always helping him. And he starts missing Cas and gets scared Cas might not come back.

(No I'm not thinking about Despair.)

Cas will be back from that mundane business like grocery shopping just in a few hours, and find Dean suddenly being very extremely gentle and happy and clingy with him. So just, they both feel happy to have each other.

\# Dean doesn't forget Cas's super strength

\# Dean enjoys using it too much
