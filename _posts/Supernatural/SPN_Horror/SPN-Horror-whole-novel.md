## Draft

### Ideas

#### Potential titles

Upon Midnight, Nightmare, No Alibi, False Alibi, Without Witness, Mr. Clever

Werewolf, Mafia

Night Falls, Close Your Eyes

#### General thoughts

（inspired by 《My Bloody Valentine》）

case fic? witch's spell?

Dean hallucinate some killer/monster in town, insist on hunting; the others can't see but there are deaths/missing people in town, they investigate

truth is it's Dean killing/abducting people but he doesn't know, it's witch's spell

they caught Dean in camera/in action, can't snap him out of it, worry it's demon possession or demon!Dean or Mark of Cain!Dean, worry they'll have to kill him

they find the witch/proof of there is a witch, hunt them down, snap Dean out of it, save him and others (in some cave/underground/abandoned house, alive)

OR: it's self-unaware amnesic serial killer Cas (S9 human!Cas time), thinking he's helping the Winchesters on case, actually he's the one committing it, he doesn't even know -> Dean feel betrayed again? trust issue like 619 between destiel again?

OR: combine both, they're both cursed and both the serial killers, but neither knows, so both suspect the other, turn on each other for a bit, then realize the witch has them both -> kill the witch, save the day

(or no witch at all, like DW world A/B, the place has some poison that brings the worst of both, both are killer/torturer in the dark side)

#### Summary at idea check-in

Inspired by Jensen's "My Bloody Valentine", Dean/Cas/Sam go into this small town and find people dying, try to solve the case but find it very difficult, meanwhile Dean/Cas find their motel has some bloody evidence, one of them might be the secret murderer, but all three of them deny it. They start getting suspicious and turn against each other a bit, Dean thinks it's Cas getting brainwashed and start killing people without himself even knowing, Cas thinks it's Dean maybe having some relapse from Mark of Cain/demon!Dean time. People continue getting killed bloody around them, by coincidence both Dean/Cas has no alibi (could have potentially committed it and framed on the other unknowingly). They monitor each other 24/7 trying to figure out who is wrong and very on edge. Then big revelation.

(revelation: both destiel are killers)

possible timelines: S10 timeline, MoC!Dean & stolen-grace!Cas; early season, Dean post-hell (post 401), Cas post-brainwash (post 419), S5 timeline, big bad guy being Lucifer/four horsemen (War? Death? just Lucifer personally having fun there? Death+Lucifer, rewrite S05E15)

location: Sioux Falls, South Dakota

### Extended idea

Put the story into *Werewolf* setting frame, they're forced into game without knowing. The human behavior is reflected truthfully. Tell the story according to the *Werewolf* rules.

roles: werewolf (Dean/Cas), villager (Benny Sutton, Clay Thompson's wife, Digger Wells, Henry Beesome the popular school student, Marcy Ward, Sean Mills, Stephan Phelps math teacher), seer/detective (Deputy Frank? Jody), sheriff (Jody Mills), witch (a bad doctor, Doctor Gaines), ~~fool?, hunter (Bobby, Rufus?, Garth?)~~

real bad guy (potentials): some poisonous materials in the town, mushroom or something in the air or water; a pagan god, a trickster, a bad rogue angel similar to Zachariah's power ability; a really strong witch like Wanda Maximoff from MCU; a curse

### Outline

515 timeline (2010, March 25), Sioux Fall, South Dakota

big background: Lucifer is trying to persuade Sam to say yes, Michael on Dean, four Horsemen are rising (War, Famine was killed), Death was bound by Lucifer (purpose: town's behavior is basically Michael+Lucifer's game board, having a little killing-time fun before big fight, "killing time, sometimes people", two archangels want to take Cas out of picture, only to make Dean more sure about Cas should be with them in this together, regret doubting Cas even if he is controlled to killing)

(setting: Cas has no power as soon as in town, Bobby in wheelchair)

day 1: Sioux Falls has unusual demon activity report + everyone forced to sleep over night, Dean/Sam/Bobby notice, no one knows why, Dean/Sam/Cas come to Sioux Falls to investigate, meet Sheriff Jody Mills (casual mention her husband Sean Mills), live in Bobby's place

day 2: over night, Benny Sutton is killed violently. Jody visit Bobby's house, questions/suspects them, saying witness (Digger Wells) sees killer coming this direction (figure tall, so not Bobby), all 3 deny, Jody takes them to station, ask questions; they meet other people in station being asked question, Clay Thompson's wife & Digger Wells, they learn about Benny/Clay old story, meet Deputy Frank; TFW go to crime scene, town folks crowded & gossiping (Doctor Gaines come pick up body)

day 3: over night, Digger Wells is severely wounded but not dead, Doctor Gaines is right on time almost as if know it's coming and take care of him. Bobby's place has blood stain in entrance, not knowing which one of them, start slightly freaking out and suspect each other, all claim to have slept over night even include Cas. Deputy Frank come visit, want to take them to station, they get rid of evidence, insist nothing suspicious, Deputy left but not convinced, and they know he knew something. split: Bobby/Sam go to crime scene, Jody is there, the crowd (Marcy Ward, Sean Mills, Stephan Phelps math teacher, Henry the highschooler) accuse Clay's wife, shame-calling her, Jody has to take her to station for security; Dean/Cas go to hospital to question Digger Wells what he sees, Digger freaks out at the sight of them, further confirm it's one of them, both start slowly painfully untrust each other, Doctor Gaines expel them out of patient's room; talk with Doctor Gaines, show his medicines, saying he's offering people who don't feel safe meds to help them sleep better, some are extracted new experiments; fruitless, all go home, exchange info

day 4: over night, Digger Wells and Doctor Gaines both dead, Digger die of poison, Doctor's death brutal. Dean/Cas has bloodstains on their jackets & weapons, both claim to not leave house, start calling each other liar and say possible reason why they might turn dark over night and not know. Sam start noticing the pattern, saying the resemblance of the *Werewolf* game, think Doctor is the "witch" role, Deputy is the "seer" role. TFW are the last see them both alive, Jody comes questioning again, see bloodstains, take them both to station, find Clay's wife hang herself in station jail bc of humiliation (basically killed by the villagers). Sam ask Deputy to check the theory, Deputy claims all he was sure is Sam and Doctor are clean (the two he convinced). Dean/Cas get locked up for one night for security procedure, their hands locked together just to keep watch each other in case, Deputy keep guard

day 5: over night, Deputy is killed brutally, finger pointing at Dean's cell before death; Dean/Cas escape station, bloodstain along their way, not return to Bobby's. Jody come to Bobby's, confirm it's one of Dean/Cas, Bobby/Sam freak out, need to find them first, still don't believe why they would do such thing, Jody says she'll have to kill them on sight if resist arrest. Dean/Cas big fight outside town in the cemetery, both hurt for not committed crime but wasn't trusted by the other. Sam calls Dean, talking about his theory, thinking the whole town is one big bloody *Werewolf* game, only way to end is to win or lose, so either all wolves are dead or all villagers are dead, tell them Jody is already convinced it's Dean. Dean/Cas both say it's not them, for once Dean slightly believe Cas and rethink theory, but then who is always in all scenes and have access to all jails and crime locations and can frame them if have to -- Jody. Dean/Cas convinced Jody is the wolf behind scene, possibly possessed, Sam warn them careful about the "kill on sight". Night falls.

day 6: over night, Jody is killed violently in the station, big gun fight, both Dean/Cas bloody in scene, weapons in hand, no memory of what happened, freaked out; Sam come to check station camera record, (rewind to) night 5: everyone forced to sleep, Jody is awake, on look out, (Dean thought it's a winning theory, the awake is the wolf), but Jody not attack (sheriff the real seer, deputy protecting seer), Cas enter scene, confront, Jody not attack, warn him of Dean, Cas not concerned, start attacking, Jody has to fight back, able to resist for a bit (Dean/Cas devasted Cas is indeed wolf, Dean point gun at Cas), Dean enter scene, Jody thought if Cas is bad then Dean must be good, ask for help, Dean smirk, help Cas instead, attack Jody together until she's dead (both devastated again both are bad guys); stunned looking at their hands, Jody's blood, Bobby devastated for they're good friends, but they really don't remember so does that make them villains (even got pointed, Cas doesn't point gun at Dean); the crowd (Marcy Ward, Sean Mills, Stephan Phelps math teacher, Henry the highschooler) gathering station, see Jody dead, convinced Dean/Cas killer, ready to kill them, Sean Mills (Jody's husband) has guns, shoot at Dean first, Cas instinctively jump before Dean, bullet through him then Dean's throat, Cas dead instantly, Dean gurgle in blood for thirty seconds longer, in disbelief Cas's dead for real, murmur "Cas", then watch sunset at exact second, energy wave sweep through the whole town, night falls

day 7: over night, no one dies, the town comes back normal, Dean wake up on the station floor, Cas grace self-heal slowly and wake up. ask what happened, Cas thinks because wolves stay awake over night so Dean survived the night by luck, they are both exposed, so game over (even though wolf lost), his grace comes back over night during the supposed wolf wake hour, so he gets to self-heal and eventually resurrect, all by luck (and still doesn't know why or who curse the whole town). and the killed over the seven days are still all dead, Sam suggest they leave town immediately, Bobby mourn Jody, Sean Mills still want to revenge. Jody resurrect, bringing message from "Death", it's a warning from Lucifer, telling them what would happen if they continue refuse to say yes to him, the whole world can be his fucking killing game, and disappointed his attempt of taking Cas out of the board (hopefully by Dean's hand) doesn't work, but maybe next time. TFW grimace, Dean glad they're alive, Sam solemn, they jump back into season 5 main task of finding ways to fight Lucifer. (hopeful canon-compliant ending)

### Chap 1: Day One

> Sioux Falls has unusual demon activity report + everyone forced to sleep over night, Dean/Sam/Bobby notice, no one knows why, Dean/Sam/Cas come to Sioux Falls to investigate, meet Sheriff Jody Mills (casual mention her husband Sean Mills), live in Bobby's place

Rain pours down outside the window, muffling all the color to grey and dirty white. Blinding lightning flashes through the dark sky, cutting it open like knife cutting through butter. Thunders roll over the roof, shaking the earth. As if it's the end of the world.

Except... it *is* the end of the world.

"Is it me or it looks a hell lot like a demonic sign?" Dean stands in front of the window, staring at the downpour. It's not night yet, but just looking at the color of the sky, one can't tell the difference.

"That, plus South Dakota in a storm season." Bobby grumbles, wheeling into the living room with a beer by hand.

"Is that why you called us? I can't find any demon activity in the area though, no suspicious death, no missing people report. I mean, sure, the lightening storms look suspicious, but we might need something more than weather to find Lucifer." Sam looks up from his laptop, glancing at Bobby.

Bobby doesn't answer for a minute, taking a drag on the beer before speaking again.

Dean turns back from the window, looking at him. "Bobby?"

"There is something," Bobby lifts the bottle, leaving it on the desk with far too many layers of books and notes to see the desk. "You wouldn't notice unless you live here."

"Which is?" Dean prompts impatiently.

"People go to sleep over the night." Bobby says, with a gloomy face.

Dean blinks. "Right. Last I checked, that's what people do over the night."

Bobby shakes his head. "No, you don't get it. I mean *everyone* in the town, doesn't matter you want to sleep or not, where you are, what you're doing, the night falls, and you just, close your eyes and fall asleep. No huss, no fuss. The next time you open your eyes, it's the next morning."

"Okay, that's weird." Sam says slowly, sitting straight in the chair.

"I'm listening." Dean says, walking toward the desk.

Bobby meets their eyes, gesturing to the books crowding the desk. "Well, that's all I got. I checked everything, all the legends and lore I can find -- demons, angels, archangels. Nothing says anything about apocalypse giving you a sweet night's sleep."

"You thinking it's Lucifer?" Sam says carefully.

Bobby shrugs. "Could be, but we don't know for sure. Or what he wants, or if he's in town."

"Anything special happening over the night? When everyone's sleeping?" Dean asks, standing by the desk, glancing at the opened pages and books. But the scrambled paintings of the devil doesn't give any clue.

"That's just it, nothing happens. Even if they do, no one remembers." Bobby reaches for the beer again. "As far as I know, Devil can have a party on the street for all he wants over the night and clean up just before the sunrise, we wouldn't have the faintest clue."

Dean exchanges an uneasy look with Sam. That might exactly be what Lucifer would do.

"When did it start?" Sam shifts in his seat, starting to type on his laptop again. "There maybe some camera footage we can check."

"Nice thinking." Dean walks over, shadowing behind his chair, looking at the screen.

"A few weeks ago." Bobby answers vaguely.

Dean glances at him, "Can't get more specific?"

Bobby glares at him, "What? I haven't exactly been tracking my sleeping schedule, alright? Not like I have a work schedule to keep up with."

Dean is about to retort, when Sam cuts in, "At least we know it didn't happen last time all of us were here."

That puts both of them to silence. It is hard to forget when the last time they were here, the room was packed with six of them, in a beautiful waking night of drinking game and battle preparation. Only four of them still walking and breathing now. The last photo with all of them laughing and smiling is burned in the fire place.

That was indeed, several weeks ago.

Dean swallows, looking back at Sam's laptop screen.

Bobby resumes drinking his half bottle of beer.

"Find anything?" Dean asks, not keeping the hope too high. It would have been too easy.

Sam shakes his head. "Too much rain, can't see a thing." The replayed tape looks nothing other than old-time black-white TV without signal, just snowflakes of white noise buzzing the channel.

"Of course it does." Dean says, unimpressed, pulling a chair for himself next to the desk to sink in.

"You want to try your angel buddy?" Bobby puts down the empty bottle with a thud.

"What, you think Cas would know something about it?" Dean raises his eyebrows, running into two pairs of eyes shooting his way.

"No harm just asking," Sam says reasonably, "it's good if he knows something, better than just us scratching our brains out."

Dean huffs a short laugh, "No one's dying or anything, don't you think we should wait for something bigger to ring the bell? Man's busy looking for his Dad with a capital 'G.'"

"Jesus, what are you, nervous about ringing a phone to your crush or something?" Bobby grunts, "Just get on with it."

Dean gives him a wide-eyed glare, then closes his eyes for a prayer. "Cas, need you here for a minute. The town's getting a bit weird, could be nothing --"

"What is it?" Castiel asks, appearing in front of the window. The thunder outside is so loud that it even covered the usual sound of his flapping wings.

"Hey, Cas." Dean turns to him on his chair. "We got a sleeping beauty problem, for everyone in the town, night-time only."

Castiel frowns at him in slight confusion.

Sam explains, "Bobby said everyone in Sioux Falls are forced to sleep over the night. No one remembers anything, no one in exception."

"We don't know if it's Lucifer or one of the two remaining horsemen." Dean amends.

"I'll take a look," Castiel says, closing his eyes, but does not disappear as Dean thought he would. The angel frowns deeper at himself.

Dean looks at him curiously. "Cas, you're still here."

"I know," Castiel says, eyes wide open now with an alarmed look.

"What is it?" Dean straightens his back immediately. Something is seriously wrong if it can make Cas disturbed like that.

"My power, it's gone." Castiel answers, with a higher pitched voice than usual, almost like a gasp.

"No." Sam breathes out unevenly.

"Lucifer?" Dean asks, alarmed.

"I don't know. I can't feel him or any other celestial beings now." Castiel looks around hurriedly, glancing at the clock on the wall.

Dean follows his gaze and moans. The clock is pointing at six. They're losing daylight fast.

"Guys, we don't have much time left for today." Bobby warns them, wheeling himself into the corner of the room, looking as if to get prepared for the coming sudden sleep.

"Don't tell me you're in this sleep curse too now." Dean stares at Castiel.

The angel returns the stare, "We'll see shortly."

And then, the night falls.
