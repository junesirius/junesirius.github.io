## Draft

### Ideas

#### Potential titles

Upon Midnight, Nightmare, No Alibi, False Alibi, Without Witness, Mr. Clever

Werewolf, Mafia

Night Falls, Close Your Eyes

#### General thoughts

（inspired by 《My Bloody Valentine》）

case fic? witch's spell?

Dean hallucinate some killer/monster in town, insist on hunting; the others can't see but there are deaths/missing people in town, they investigate

truth is it's Dean killing/abducting people but he doesn't know, it's witch's spell

they caught Dean in camera/in action, can't snap him out of it, worry it's demon possession or demon!Dean or Mark of Cain!Dean, worry they'll have to kill him

they find the witch/proof of there is a witch, hunt them down, snap Dean out of it, save him and others (in some cave/underground/abandoned house, alive)

OR: it's self-unaware amnesic serial killer Cas (S9 human!Cas time), thinking he's helping the Winchesters on case, actually he's the one committing it, he doesn't even know -> Dean feel betrayed again? trust issue like 619 between destiel again?

OR: combine both, they're both cursed and both the serial killers, but neither knows, so both suspect the other, turn on each other for a bit, then realize the witch has them both -> kill the witch, save the day

(or no witch at all, like DW world A/B, the place has some poison that brings the worst of both, both are killer/torturer in the dark side)

#### Summary at idea check-in

Inspired by Jensen's "My Bloody Valentine", Dean/Cas/Sam go into this small town and find people dying, try to solve the case but find it very difficult, meanwhile Dean/Cas find their motel has some bloody evidence, one of them might be the secret murderer, but all three of them deny it. They start getting suspicious and turn against each other a bit, Dean thinks it's Cas getting brainwashed and start killing people without himself even knowing, Cas thinks it's Dean maybe having some relapse from Mark of Cain/demon!Dean time. People continue getting killed bloody around them, by coincidence both Dean/Cas has no alibi (could have potentially committed it and framed on the other unknowingly). They monitor each other 24/7 trying to figure out who is wrong and very on edge. Then big revelation.

(revelation: both destiel are killers)

possible timelines: S10 timeline, MoC!Dean & stolen-grace!Cas; early season, Dean post-hell (post 401), Cas post-brainwash (post 419), S5 timeline, big bad guy being Lucifer/four horsemen (War? Death? just Lucifer personally having fun there? Death+Lucifer, rewrite S05E15)

location: Sioux Falls, South Dakota

### Extended idea

Put the story into *Werewolf* setting frame, they're forced into game without knowing. The human behavior is reflected truthfully. Tell the story according to the *Werewolf* rules.

roles: werewolf (Dean/Cas), villager (Benny Sutton, Clay Thompson's wife, Digger Wells, Henry Beesome the popular school student, Marcy Ward, Sean Mills, Stephan Phelps math teacher), seer/detective (Deputy Frank? Jody), sheriff (Jody Mills), witch (a bad doctor, Doctor Gaines), ~~fool?, hunter (Bobby, Rufus?, Garth?)~~

real bad guy (potentials): some poisonous materials in the town, mushroom or something in the air or water; a pagan god, a trickster, a bad rogue angel similar to Zachariah's power ability; a really strong witch like Wanda Maximoff from MCU; a curse

### Outline

515 timeline (2010, March 25), Sioux Falls, South Dakota

big background: Lucifer is trying to persuade Sam to say yes, Michael on Dean, four Horsemen are rising (War, Famine was killed), Death was bound by Lucifer (purpose: town's behavior is basically Michael+Lucifer's game board, having a little killing-time fun before big fight, "killing time, sometimes people", two archangels want to take Cas out of picture, only to make Dean more sure about Cas should be with them in this together, regret doubting Cas even if he is controlled to killing)

(setting: Cas has no power as soon as in town, Bobby in wheelchair)

day 1: Sioux Falls has unusual demon activity report + everyone forced to sleep over night, Dean/Sam/Bobby notice, no one knows why, Dean/Sam/Cas come to Sioux Falls to investigate, meet Sheriff Jody Mills (casual mention her husband Sean Mills), live in Bobby's place

day 2: over night, Benny Sutton is killed violently. Jody visit Bobby's house, questions/suspects them, saying witness (Digger Wells) sees killer coming this direction (figure tall, so not Bobby), all 3 deny, Jody takes them to station, ask questions; they meet other people in station being asked question, Clay Thompson's wife & Digger Wells, they learn about Benny/Clay old story, meet Deputy Frank; TFW go to crime scene, town folks crowded & gossiping (Doctor Gaines come pick up body)

day 3: over night, Digger Wells is severely wounded but not dead, Doctor Gaines is right on time almost as if know it's coming and take care of him. Bobby's place has blood stain in entrance, not knowing which one of them, start slightly freaking out and suspect each other, all claim to have slept over night even include Cas. Deputy Frank come visit, want to take them to station, they get rid of evidence, insist nothing suspicious, Deputy left but not convinced, and they know he knew something. split: Bobby/Sam go to crime scene, Jody is there, the crowd (Marcy Ward, Sean Mills, Stephan Phelps math teacher, Henry the highschooler) accuse Clay's wife, shame-calling her, Jody has to take her to station for security; Dean/Cas go to hospital to question Digger Wells what he sees, Digger freaks out at the sight of them, further confirm it's one of them, both start slowly painfully untrust each other, Doctor Gaines expel them out of patient's room; talk with Doctor Gaines, show his medicines, saying he's offering people who don't feel safe meds to help them sleep better, some are extracted new experiments; fruitless, all go home, exchange info

day 4: over night, Digger Wells and Doctor Gaines both dead, Digger die of poison, Doctor's death brutal. Dean/Cas has bloodstains on their jackets & weapons, both claim to not leave house, start calling each other liar and say possible reason why they might turn dark over night and not know. Sam start noticing the pattern, saying the resemblance of the *Werewolf* game, think Doctor is the "witch" role, Deputy is the "seer" role. TFW are the last see them both alive, Jody comes questioning again, see bloodstains, take them both to station, find Clay's wife hang herself in station jail bc of humiliation (basically killed by the villagers). Sam ask Deputy to check the theory, Deputy claims all he was sure is Sam and Doctor are clean (the two he convinced). Dean/Cas get locked up for one night for security procedure, their hands locked together just to keep watch each other in case, Deputy keep guard

day 5: over night, Deputy is killed brutally, finger pointing at Dean's cell before death; Dean/Cas escape station, bloodstain along their way, not return to Bobby's. Jody come to Bobby's, confirm it's one of Dean/Cas, Bobby/Sam freak out, need to find them first, still don't believe why they would do such thing, Jody says she'll have to kill them on sight if resist arrest. Dean/Cas big fight outside town in the cemetery, both hurt for not committed crime but wasn't trusted by the other. Sam calls Dean, talking about his theory, thinking the whole town is one big bloody *Werewolf* game, only way to end is to win or lose, so either all wolves are dead or all villagers are dead, tell them Jody is already convinced it's Dean. Dean/Cas both say it's not them, for once Dean slightly believe Cas and rethink theory, but then who is always in all scenes and have access to all jails and crime locations and can frame them if have to -- Jody. Dean/Cas convinced Jody is the wolf behind scene, possibly possessed, Sam warn them careful about the "kill on sight". Night falls.

day 6: over night, Jody is killed violently in the station, big gun fight, both Dean/Cas bloody in scene, weapons in hand, no memory of what happened, freaked out; Sam come to check station camera record, (rewind to) night 5: everyone forced to sleep, Jody is awake, on look out, (Dean thought it's a winning theory, the awake is the wolf), but Jody not attack (sheriff the real seer, deputy protecting seer), Cas enter scene, confront, Jody not attack, warn him of Dean, Cas not concerned, start attacking, Jody has to fight back, able to resist for a bit (Dean/Cas devasted Cas is indeed wolf, Dean point gun at Cas), Dean enter scene, Jody thought if Cas is bad then Dean must be good, ask for help, Dean smirk, help Cas instead, attack Jody together until she's dead (both devastated again both are bad guys); stunned looking at their hands, Jody's blood, Bobby devastated for they're good friends, but they really don't remember so does that make them villains (even got pointed, Cas doesn't point gun at Dean); the crowd (Marcy Ward, Sean Mills, Stephan Phelps math teacher, Henry the highschooler) gathering station, see Jody dead, convinced Dean/Cas killer, ready to kill them, Sean Mills (Jody's husband) has guns, shoot at Dean first, Cas instinctively jump before Dean, bullet through him then Dean's throat, Cas dead instantly, Dean gurgle in blood for thirty seconds longer, in disbelief Cas's dead for real, murmur "Cas", then watch sunset at exact second, energy wave sweep through the whole town, night falls

day 7: over night, no one dies, the town comes back normal, Dean wake up on the station floor, Cas grace self-heal slowly and wake up. ask what happened, Cas thinks because wolves stay awake over night so Dean survived the night by luck, they are both exposed, so game over (even though wolf lost), his grace comes back over night during the supposed wolf wake hour, so he gets to self-heal and eventually resurrect, all by luck (and still doesn't know why or who curse the whole town). and the killed over the seven days are still all dead, Sam suggest they leave town immediately, Bobby mourn Jody, Sean Mills still want to revenge. Jody resurrect, bringing message from "Death", it's a warning from Lucifer, telling them what would happen if they continue refuse to say yes to him, the whole world can be his fucking killing game, and disappointed his attempt of taking Cas out of the board (hopefully by Dean's hand) doesn't work, but maybe next time. TFW grimace, Dean glad they're alive, Sam solemn, they jump back into season 5 main task of finding ways to fight Lucifer. (hopeful canon-compliant ending)

### Claim

#### Claim summary

Inspired by Jensen's "My Bloody Valentine", canon divergent set in S5 timeline after Death is released but no walking dead zombies, replacing episode S05E15 "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid." Everything happens in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Dean, Cas, Sam are at Bobby's place, noticing everyone is forced to sleep at night, no one remembers anything from the night, and people are mysteriously and violently killed over the night. They try to solve the case but find it very difficult.

Meanwhile, Dean and Cas find bloody evidence and traces always surround them, convinced that one of them might be the secret murderer, they start getting suspicious of and turn against each other, and both feel very hurt.

Many local Sioux Falls villagers are involved, either getting killed or following the cases closely, including Sheriff Jody Mills. After four days, Sam notices the pattern that almost always a person killed violently over the night, and another innocent person gets accused during the day by the villagers and dies a random other way. His theory is the whole town is a big bloody real-life *Werewolf* game, many villagers have special game roles like "Doctor", "Seer", etc.

Dean and Cas hate fighting each other, so decide to trust each other regardless of the evidences. The new theory is they are being framed by Jody.

The last game night, Jody is killed by the wolf, and in the morning, recorded camera footage shows actually both Dean and Cas are the killers (wolves), the villagers (especially Jody's husband Sean) attack them to avenge Jody. Cas sacrifices himself to protect Dean, the night falls. The game ends.

It turns out the whole game is controlled by Death, who's under Lucifer's leash. It's a warning game from Lucifer. But they're lucky that Cas's death is during the game night, when the wolves are reset to alive, so he's resurrected. And Jody's also resurrected to bring them the message from Death. They go back to looking for ways to fight Death and Lucifer like the canon continues after S05E15.

#### Visuals

Dean and Cas have big arguments in Bobby's place, both having bloodstains are them. They're pointing fingers at each other, both very emotional, angry and hurt.

Camera footage POV, Dean and Cas in police station, both are utterly bloody: blood everywhere, blood in hands, on their faces, clothes, murder weapon in their hands. A dead female victim in sheriff uniform lies bloody on the floor before them.

### Chap 1: Day One

> Sioux Falls has unusual demon activity report + everyone forced to sleep over night, Dean/Sam/Bobby notice, no one knows why, Dean/Sam/Cas come to Sioux Falls to investigate, meet Sheriff Jody Mills (casual mention her husband Sean Mills), live in Bobby's place

Rain pours down outside the window, muffling all the color to grey and dirty white. Blinding lightning flashes through the dark sky, cutting it open like knife cutting through butter. Thunders roll over the roof, shaking the earth. As if it's the end of the world.

Except... it *is* the end of the world.

"Is it me or it looks a hell lot like a demonic sign?" Dean stands in front of the window, staring at the downpour. It's not night yet, but just looking at the color of the sky, one can't tell the difference.

"That, plus South Dakota in a storm season." Bobby grumbles, wheeling into the living room with a beer by hand.

"Is that why you called us? I can't find any demon activity in the area though, no suspicious death, no missing people report. I mean, sure, the lightening storms look suspicious, but we might need something more than funky weather to find Lucifer." Sam looks up from his laptop, glancing at Bobby.

Bobby doesn't answer for a minute, taking a drag on the beer before speaking again.

Dean turns back from the window, looking at him. "Bobby?"

"There is something," Bobby lifts the bottle, leaving it on the desk with far too many layers of books and notes to see the desk. "You wouldn't notice unless you are here."

"Which is?" Dean prompts impatiently.

"People go to sleep over the night." Bobby says, with a gloomy face.

Dean blinks. "Right. Last I checked, that's what people do over the night."

Bobby shakes his head. "No, you don't get it. I mean *everyone* in the town, doesn't matter you want to sleep or not, where you are, what you're doing, the night falls, and you just, close your eyes and fall asleep. No huss, no fuss. The next time you open your eyes, it's the next morning."

"Okay, that's weird." Sam says slowly, sitting straight in the chair.

"I'm listening." Dean says, walking toward the desk.

Bobby meets their eyes, gesturing to the books crowding the desk. "Well, that's all I got. I checked everything, all the legends and lore I can find -- demons, angels, archangels. Nothing says anything about apocalypse giving you a sweet night's sleep."

"You thinking it's Lucifer?" Sam says carefully.

Bobby shrugs. "Could be, but we don't know for sure. Or what he wants, or if he's in town."

"Anything special happening over the night? When everyone's sleeping?" Dean asks, standing by the desk, glancing at the opened pages and books. But the scrambled paintings of the devil doesn't give any clue other than the imagined goat horns people love to draw.

"That's just it, nothing happens. Even if they do, no one remembers." Bobby reaches for the beer again. "As far as I know, Devil can have a party on the street for all he wants over the night and clean up just before the sunrise, we wouldn't have the faintest clue."

Dean exchanges an uneasy look with Sam. That might exactly be what Lucifer would do.

"When did it start?" Sam shifts in his seat, starting to type on his laptop again. "There may be some camera footage we can check."

"Nice thinking." Dean walks over, shadowing behind his chair, looking at the screen.

"A few weeks ago." Bobby answers vaguely.

Dean glances at him, "Can't get more specific?"

Bobby glares at him, "What? I haven't exactly been tracking my sleeping schedule, alright? Not like I have a work schedule to keep up with."

Dean is about to retort, when Sam cuts in, "At least we know it didn't happen last time all of us were here."

That puts both of them to silence. It is hard to forget when the last time they were here, the room was packed with six of them, in a beautiful waking night of drinking game and battle preparation. Only four of them still walking and breathing now. The last photo with all of them laughing and smiling is burned in the fire place.

That was indeed, several weeks ago.

Dean swallows, looking back at Sam's laptop screen.

Bobby resumes drinking his half bottle of beer.

"Find anything?" Dean asks, not keeping the hope too high. It would have been too easy.

Sam shakes his head. "Too much rain, can't see a thing." The replayed tape looks nothing other than old-time black-white TV without signal, just snowflakes of white noise buzzing the channel.

"Of course it does." Dean says, unimpressed, pulling a chair for himself next to the desk to sink in.

"You want to try your angel buddy?" Bobby puts down the empty bottle with a thud.

"What, you think Cas would know something about it?" Dean raises his eyebrows, running into two pairs of eyes shooting his way.

"No harm just asking." Sam says reasonably, "Good if he knows something, better than just us scratching our brains out."

Dean huffs a short laugh, "No one's dying or anything, don't you think we should wait for something bigger to ring the bell? Man's busy looking for his Dad with a capital 'G'."

"Jesus, what are you, nervous about ringing a phone to your crush or something?" Bobby grunts, "Just get on with it."

Dean gives him a wide-eyed glare, then closes his eyes for a prayer. "Cas, need you here for a minute. The town's getting a bit weird, could be nothing --"

"What is it?" Castiel asks, appearing in front of the window. The thunder outside is so loud that it covered the usual sound of his flapping wings.

"Hey, Cas." Dean turns to him on his chair. "We got a sleeping beauty problem -- for everyone in the town, night-time only."

Castiel frowns at him in light confusion.

Sam explains, "Bobby said everyone in Sioux Falls are forced to sleep over the night. No one remembers anything, no one in exception."

"We don't know if it's Lucifer or one of the two other horsemen, or anything else." Dean amends.

"I'll take a look," Castiel says, closing his eyes, but does not disappear as Dean thought he would. The angel frowns deeper at himself.

Dean looks at him curiously. "Cas, you're still here."

"I know," Castiel says, eyes wide open now with an alarmed look.

"What is it?" Dean straightens his back immediately. Something is seriously wrong if it makes Cas disturbed like that.

"My power, it's gone." Castiel answers, with a higher pitched voice than usual, almost like a gasp.

"No." Sam breathes out unevenly.

"Lucifer?" Dean asks, alarmed.

"I don't know. I can't feel him or any other celestial beings now." Castiel looks around hurriedly, glancing at the clock on the wall.

Dean follows his gaze and moans. The clock is pointing at six. They're losing daylight fast.

"Guys, we don't have much time left for today." Bobby warns them, wheeling himself to the corner of the room, looking as if to get prepared for the coming sudden sleep.

"You gotta be kidding me. Don't tell me you're in this sleep curse too now." Dean stares at Castiel, unbelievably.

The angel returns the stare with a straight face, "We'll see shortly."

<br>

And then, the night falls.

#### Act 1

"This is no fun," Dean rubs his stiffened neck, stretching his arms and legs from the forced sleep on the chair for the whole night. His boots squeak slightly with wet marks on the floor.

Sam and Bobby wake up with a yawning at the same minute.

"It really is not," Sam agrees, standing up to stretch his body, "it's worse than motel bed."

Dean murmurs an agreement. "I feel more tired than four-hours."

Castiel stands to his foot from his position of lying on the floor, his hair and trench coat both more ruffled than usual. His look is more troubled than the previous day, as if someone waking up from a nightmare that they don't quite remember, but the horrid taste lingers.

Dean eyes him, "First time falling asleep?"

Castiel meets his eyes, the furrow is deep between his eyebrows. "I don't remember anything," he says gravely, "is it normal for human's sleep?"

Dean almost laughs. "No, it's not." he tells him, "That's why it's a case, we need to figure out what's wrong."

"How?" Sam asks, walking to the window, looking out. Dean's eyes follow him. It's not raining today. The sky is still gloomy, the air smells wet, but it improves so much comparing to yesterday's downpour.

"I don't know, go into the town, ask around, see if anything wanky. You know, like doing a job, but hopefully it saves the world." Dean says, making his voice sound easy.

Sam hums softly, moving toward the door, reaching for his jacket. "Sounds like a plan."

"I would like to help," Castiel says slowly, looking at Dean.

Dean nods quietly, then manages to pull a smile for a joke, "Not like you can go anywhere without our car now, aren't you?"

The air in the room does not lift from the joke.

Dean almost reaches the door when the door bell rings. He shoots a quick questioning glance at Bobby, who answers with a blank shake of head.

Dean opens the door.

A policewoman in her neat suit flashes a badge before his eyes. "Sheriff Jody Mills. Would you mind I ask a few questions?"

"Sheriff," Dean gives her his perfect FBI smile, "to what do we own the pleasure?"

Sheriff Mills is not impressed by his smile. Her voice is all business, "Murder suspect."

"Whose murder?" Sam asks behind him. Dean doesn't notice when he walked over to the door.

"Benny Sutton," Sheriff Mills says with a straight face, but Dean can see the force she's putting to keep no extra information leak. Her eyes are widened, the lines on her face tightened.

"How bad?" Dean asks.

Sheriff Mills gives him a stern look. "Very bad, the worst kind. Look, I'm not supposed to give *you* any information before your suspect is cleared."

Dean blinks, gesturing to himself, "Me? Why me?"

"Technically, it's all... three of you." Sheriff Mills looks behind him, eyes popping on Dean, Sam, and Castiel. Then to Bobby who's wheeling himself to the door, "Bobby Singer, how many people did you shelter here?"

Bobby glares at her, "Just those three. Why do I have the feeling this is personal?"

"Trust me, nothing personal." Sheriff Mills answers, "I've got witness report."

"And they said it's one of those boys?" Bobby grunts.

"What can I say, they all match the profile." Sheriff Mills looks at them. "Where are each of you last night?"

Dean is the one answering for all of them, "Slumber party here, Bobby's place. All of us sleeping our twelve-hour long beauty sleep like everyone else in town, in case you didn't notice."

Sheriff Mills does not show any sign of noticing anything unusual in what he just said. "The whole night? From sunset to sunrise?"

"Yes," Dean says grumpily. "Are we good now?"

"Then where does that come from?" Instead of leaving with the apparent answer, Sheriff Mills stares behind him, pointing at Bobby's living room floor.

Dean turns around to look, blinking blankly as there is not really anything to see on the floor. It's wet with footprints just as he remembered.

"What, the water marks?" Sam follows the direction of her fingers, must be seeing exactly what Dean sees. "What's so strange? It was raining yesterday."

"The rain stopped before the morning. So if like you said, all of you have been staying inside for the whole night, where does the wet boot come from?" Sheriff Mills looks at the three of them one at a time meaningfully. "Maybe some of you sneak out in the night without others knowing."

Dean exchanges looks with Sam and Castiel, all of them looking disturbed by the suggested accusation, shifting uneasily.

"No way," Dean tells the Sheriff, "I know them, none of us did anything. We don't even know who this Benny Sutton guy is."

"Proof is proof," Sheriff Mills says harshly, "I'll have to bring all of you in, notes and fingerprints and all that. You want to do it easy way or easier way? My car waits on the driveway."

Dean glances behind her, and just like she said, a police car is parked on the driveway leading to the front door. No blinking red-blue siren light.

Sheriff Mills puts a hand casually on her waist, just above the belt. Dean doesn't have to guess what's in her pocket or behind the belt.

"Sure, no problem." Dean says quickly with another one of his professioned smile, nodding obediently.

Bobby asks behind him, "I'm not invited?"

Sheriff Mills gives him an unimpressed look, "Very funny, Bobby. No wheel marks, and the witness does say 'running' in this direction, not wheeling. No offense."

"None taken." Bobby deadpans, wheeling back inside as the rest of them walking outside.

<br>

#### Act 2

The station is busier than Dean would expect a small town like Sioux Falls would usually be -- which is supposed be empty, for what's worth to be "a small town."

Instead, it's almost packed. A woman is sitting in a sound-proof inquiry room with an officer. Two men sit in the reception, one middle age, the other young one looks like a high school football team star. Another messy-looking man is in a separate glass-walled room, alone.

Sheriff Mills gestures to the empty seat next to them, "Wait here."

Dean glances around the room, "Wait, those are all suspects? How many people did this Benny guy piss off?"

"You may say he's not the most popular guy in the town," Sheriff Mills says flatly, "but a crime is a crime. I'll get you when it's your turn."

The Sheriff gestures the middle-aged man at the front of the seats to follow her, and the two of them disappear behind one of the empty rooms.

Dean sits next to the highschooler, holding out a hand. "Hey, I'm Dean."

The boy shakes his hand, "Henry."

And just like he thought, Henry is indeed the football team lead in Marshall High School. And him and Benny Sutton once had a pretty nasty fight right outside the school because he insulted his girlfriend at the time.

"The dude was a grade-a asshole, I'm telling you," Henry says casually, "he had it coming."

"Is that... is that a confess?" Dean blinks, "Did you kill him?"

"What? No, not me. I'm no killer. Just saying, whoever did it must hold some grudge, and I'm telling you, they must have reasons." Henry answers easily.

"But I see the Sheriff still brought you in." Dean points out.

The boy shrugs, "She said some witness report matching the profile, but I was just in my home sleeping the whole night. I don't know anything."

"Yeah, same here, mate." Dean murmurs, "You know anything about those other people in here?"

As it turns out, the benefit of being in a small town is that everyone knows everyone. So within ten minutes, Dean gets enough stories around everyone's life. He shoots a casual glimpse in the direction of Sam and Cas while he prompts the chats and information from Henry, and notices satisfactorily that they are paying equal attention to the conversation. Great that he wouldn't have to repeat everything later.

So, according to Henry, the middle-aged man that the Sheriff just brought in is Mr. Stephan Phelps, Henry's math teacher at school, who once had a big quarrel of some kind regarding a suspected burglary in his house with the victim. The woman being questioned by Deputy Frank is Sarah Thompson, widow of Clay Thompson, who according to rumors, was murdered by Benny Sutton in an alleged hunting accident, which unquestionably makes her the top motivated suspect. And the man in the room alone, messy-haired and torn-clothed, is the town drunk Digger Wells, who doesn't seem to have any known conflict with the deceased asshole.

"Which means he's the witness." Dean thinks aloud. "He would have seen whoever committed the crime and able to ID the guy. That's why he's here."

"That makes so much sense," Henry agrees.

And that is as much time as they can squeeze, when Sheriff Mills leads the math teacher out, and calls Henry in for his turn of interrogation.

Dean leans back in the seat, glancing at Sam and Castiel. "What do you think?"

Sam says, confused, "Sounds like all just normal people to me."

Dean nods in agreement.

Castiel looks in the direction the math teacher just went out.

Dean regards him, "You got anything in your mind, Cas?"

Castiel turns to him, shaking his head. His frown does not ease since the morning.

"Yes, you are. That's your 'I have some trouble I'd just handle it myself' face. Spit it, what is it?" Dean lowers his voice, glancing at the corner of the ceiling, looking for hidden cameras. Okay, admittedly, police station isn't exactly the best place for some secret-sharing, but not like Cas is going to confess he's the one committed the crime, is him?

"I was afraid I might be the one committed the crime." Castiel says gravely.

Dean glares at him with widened eyes, whispering rapidly, "What the hell are you talking about? You said you fell asleep the whole night, like the rest of us."

"I did," Castiel looks at him straight in the eyes, troubled, "and I don't remember anything over the night, so I assumed I slept. But my shoes, they're wet in the morning."

"So what, mine too, doesn't mean anything." Dean rushes.

"Dean," Sam chimes in with his whisper, his face undergoing that slow process of realization dawning on him, "we were walking into Bobby's house yesterday."

"So?" Dean says annoyedly, and then immediately, "Oh."

He looks at Castiel, scrutinizing him more closely now. Castiel is unshaken under his suddenly guarded look.

"We walked in when it was raining, so yeah, totally normal with wet shoes, but you -- you flew in. Are you, uh, possessed or something?" Dean looks at him with doubted eyes, "Are you still Castiel?"

Castiel blinks, the frown adding more layers of complicated lines, "Yes, Dean. I'm still me."

"Maybe Heaven's brainwashed version? Maybe 'Work for Heaven, not for man like me' killer-angel Castiel?" Dean prompts under his breath, gritting his teeth. His hands reach toward the back of his belt, but not catching the familiar touch of a gun, realizing he didn't bring any weapon on their trip to the station.

Castiel lowers his look to the floor. "I don't think it's me," he says weakly. "And I'm sorry about that time."

Dean follows his look closely, swallowing hard. Not like he had any choice that time.

"Dean, we can't be sure yet." Sam hisses quietly.

Dean thinks for a second. "Alright, here's what we're gonna do. Don't say anything when the Sheriff asks, just say you stayed at Bobby's the whole night, sleeping like a baby. We are each other's alibi. Then we get out, check out the crime scene, see if we can find anything. Hopefully to prove you innocent, if proved otherwise, we'll deal with it. Capiche?"

Sam and Castiel nod solemnly.

<br>

They are released from the police station after all the procedures -- which is quite a lot, just to say the least. The sun is turning to the southern half of the sky. Dean checks his watch practically every five minutes -- they wouldn't want to spend the bloody forced sleeping night on some random road outside.

The crime place is inside Benny Sutton's house.

The man is definitely not the most clean human in the planet to do house-keeping, and the decoration of his brain is not making the situation any better. The place looks pink even just looking from the outside.

His house is covered by police warning lines, and a small crowd is still chattering outside the place.

If it's any of their usual cases, they'd just come back after dark. But the "night falls, you close your eyes" rule is making their life a little more difficult than usual.

They stand outside the warning line like everyone else, hoping to take a peek at the inside.

Dean recognizes a few familiar faces in the crowd.

Henry the high school boy is talking to a man in doctor's white gown.

Dean edges toward them, standing close enough to hear their conversation, and gestures Sam and Castiel to copy him.

"Doctor Gaines, what did you see?" Henry is asking.

The Doctor hesitates, "I'm sure there is some NDA or something, I'm probably not supposed to say anything."

"Come on, Doctor, you know everyone would find out everything in the end, after all it's just a small town." Henry encourages.

Doctor Gaines is very easily convinced, "Well, the forensic called in sick today, so the Sheriff asked me to step in. To be honest, there really isn't much left to be done, medical-wise."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, to start with, there isn't much of him left. It's worse than putting a man in a wood chopper, I'm afraid." Doctor Gaines says uneasily, "I hate to say bad for dead guys, but even someone like Benny Sutton, doesn't deserve something like that. He might not be the best neighbor in the town, sure, but it's not like he's the worst devil to be damned. Whoever did this to him, from what I can tell, practically smashed his brain out, cut every piece of him until there's nothing left to cut, and smashed all the pieces and bones."

Henry gasps sharply.

Even Dean has to remind his brain not to imagine the visual with too much details.

"I'm sorry. Is that too much? I shouldn't have said so much..." the Doctor hurries an apology.

"No, that's fine... I mean, yeah, no, I have to go." Henry leaves in a rush, hand covering his mouth.

Dean turns his back to Sam and Castiel just in time so the Doctor wouldn't notice he's been listening.

"I don't think there's more to ask or see," Dean says to them.

"We should probably go now," Sam suggests.

"I don't believe we have the pleasure of meeting." the Doctor's voice sounds up behind them.

Dean has to turn to him, with a forced polite smile, holding out a hand. "Dean," he says, then gestures to Sam and Castiel behind him, "and they're my brothers. Here to visit our uncle."

Doctor Gaines shakes his hand. "I see you have an interest in real-life crimes."

Dean widens his eyes slightly in surprise. "What? No. We're just..." he flashes a quick glimpse at Sam and Cas, looking for an excuse, "Want to make sure the neighborhood is safe."

"So that we can rest assured to leave our uncle here." Sam helps him out. Dean shoots him an appreciated look.

"I see." the Doctor nods approvingly, then reaches inside his pocket and fetches an ID card for them. "Well, if you don't feel safe, here's my number. I might have something just right for you."

Dean squints at the card, which is far too colorful and witchy to his taste for a decent doctor, but who knows, maybe it's just a really artistic doctor with a designer dream.

"Legal stuff?" Dean takes the card, asking casually.

The Doctor just shakes his hand again. "Call me if you need me. I can be helpful."

He leaves without another word.

"He seem sketchy to you?" Dean passes the card to Sam. Castiel looks at the paper carefully from the side.

"Very." Sam flips the card back and forth. The backside is a kind of poisonous dark-green color, the front bright bubbling purple. "I'd be more convinced it's a witch's potion shop ads. But who knows, maybe people nowadays like it."

Dean rolls his eyes, "Yeah, maybe."

They get back to Bobby's place barely before the sunset.

<br>

And the night falls.
