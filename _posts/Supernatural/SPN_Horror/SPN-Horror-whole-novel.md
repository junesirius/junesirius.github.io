## Draft

### Ideas

#### Potential title

Upon Midnight, Nightmare, No Alibi, False Alibi, Without Witness, Mr. Clever

Werewolf, Mafia

Night Falls, Close Your Eyes

#### General thoughts

（inspired by 《My Bloody Valentine》）

case fic? witch's spell?

Dean hallucinate some killer/monster in town, insist on hunting; the others can't see but there are deaths/missing people in town, they investigate

truth is it's Dean killing/abducting people but he doesn't know, it's witch's spell

they caught Dean in camera/in action, can't snap him out of it, worry it's demon possession or demon!Dean or Mark of Cain!Dean, worry they'll have to kill him

they find the witch/proof of there is a witch, hunt them down, snap Dean out of it, save him and others (in some cave/underground/abandoned house, alive)

OR: it's self-unaware amnesic serial killer Cas (S9 human!Cas time), thinking he's helping the Winchesters on case, actually he's the one committing it, he doesn't even know -> Dean feel betrayed again? trust issue like 619 between destiel again?

OR: combine both, they're both cursed and both the serial killers, but neither knows, so both suspect the other, turn on each other for a bit, then realize the witch has them both -> kill the witch, save the day

(or no witch at all, like DW world A/B, the place has some poison that brings the worst of both, both are killer/torturer in the dark side)

#### Summary at idea check-in

Inspired by Jensen's "My Bloody Valentine", Dean/Cas/Sam go into this small town and find people dying, try to solve the case but find it very difficult, meanwhile Dean/Cas find their motel has some bloody evidence, one of them might be the secret murderer, but all three of them deny it. They start getting suspicious and turn against each other a bit, Dean thinks it's Cas getting brainwashed and start killing people without himself even knowing, Cas thinks it's Dean maybe having some relapse from Mark of Cain/demon!Dean time. People continue getting killed bloody around them, by coincidence both Dean/Cas has no alibi (could have potentially committed it and framed on the other unknowingly). They monitor each other 24/7 trying to figure out who is wrong and very on edge. Then big revelation.

(revelation: both destiel are killers)

possible timelines: S10 timeline, MoC!Dean & stolen-grace!Cas; early season, Dean post-hell (post 401), Cas post-brainwash (post 419), S5 timeline, big bad guy being Lucifer/four horsemen (War? Death? just Lucifer personally having fun there? Death+Lucifer, rewrite S05E15)

location: Sioux Falls, South Dakota

### Extended idea

Put the story into *Werewolf* setting frame, they're forced into game without knowing. The human behavior is reflected truthfully. Tell the story according to the *Werewolf* rules.

roles: werewolf (Dean/Cas), villager (Benny Sutton, Clay Thompson's wife, Digger Wells, Henry Beesome the popular school student, Marcy Ward, Sean Mills, Stephan Phelps math teacher), seer/detective (Deputy Frank? Jody), sheriff (Jody Mills), witch (a bad doctor, Doctor Gaines), ~~fool?, hunter (Bobby, Rufus?, Garth?)~~

real bad guy (potentials): some poisonous materials in the town, mushroom or something in the air or water; a pagan god, a trickster, a bad rogue angel similar to Zachariah's power ability; a really strong witch like Wanda Maximoff from MCU; a curse

### Outline

515 timeline (2010, March 25), Sioux Fall, South Dakota

big background: Lucifer is trying to persuade Sam to say yes, Michael on Dean, four Horsemen are rising (War, Famine was killed), Death was bound by Lucifer (purpose: town's behavior is basically Michael+Lucifer's game board, having a little killing-time fun before big fight, "killing time, sometimes people", two archangels want to take Cas out of picture, only to make Dean more sure about Cas should be with them in this together, regret doubting Cas even if he is controlled to killing)

(setting: Cas has no power as soon as in town)

day 1: Sioux Falls has unusual demon activity report + everyone forced to sleep over night, Dean/Sam/Bobby notice, no one knows why, Dean/Sam/Cas come to Sioux Fall to investigate, meet Sheriff Jody Mills (casual mention her husband Sean Mills), live in Bobby's place

day 2: over night, Benny Sutton is killed violently. Jody visit Bobby's house, questions/suspects them, saying witness (Digger Wells) sees killer coming this direction (figure tall, so not Bobby), all 3 deny, Jody takes them to station, ask questions; they meet other people in station being asked question, Clay Thompson's wife & Digger Wells, they learn about Benny/Clay old story, meet Deputy Frank; TFW go to crime scene, town folks crowded & gossiping (Doctor Gaines come pick up body)

day 3: over night, Digger Wells is severely wounded but not dead, Doctor Gaines is right on time almost as if know it's coming and take care of him. Bobby's place has blood stain in entrance, not knowing which one of them, start slightly freaking out and suspect each other, all claim to have slept over night even include Cas. Deputy Frank come visit, want to take them to station, they get rid of evidence, insist nothing suspicious, Deputy left but not convinced, and they know he knew something. split: Bobby/Sam go to crime scene, Jody is there, the crowd (Marcy Ward, Sean Mills, Stephan Phelps math teacher, Henry the highschooler) accuse Clay's wife, shame-calling her, Jody has to take her to station for security; Dean/Cas go to hospital to question Digger Wells what he sees, Digger freaks out at the sight of them, further confirm it's one of them, both start slowly painfully untrust each other, Doctor Gaines expel them out of patient's room; talk with Doctor Gaines, show his medicines, saying he's offering people who don't feel safe meds to help them sleep better, some are extracted new experiments; fruitless, all go home, exchange info

day 4: over night, Digger Wells and Doctor Gaines both dead, Digger die of poison, Doctor's death brutal. Dean/Cas has bloodstains on their jackets & weapons, both claim to not leave house, start calling each other liar and say possible reason why they might turn dark over night and not know. Sam start noticing the pattern, saying the resemblance of the *Werewolf* game, think Doctor is the "witch" role, Deputy is the "seer" role. TFW are the last see them both alive, Jody comes questioning again, see bloodstains, take them both to station, find Clay's wife hang herself in station jail bc of humiliation (basically killed by the villagers). Sam ask Deputy to check the theory, Deputy claims all he was sure is Sam and Doctor are clean (the two he convinced). Dean/Cas get locked up for one night for security procedure, their hands locked together just to keep watch each other in case, Deputy keep guard

day 5: over night, Deputy is killed brutally, finger pointing at Dean's cell before death; Dean/Cas escape station, bloodstain along their way, not return to Bobby's. Jody come to Bobby's, confirm it's one of Dean/Cas, Bobby/Sam freak out, need to find them first, still don't believe why they would do such thing, Jody says she'll have to kill them on sight if resist arrest. Dean/Cas big fight outside town in the cemetery, both hurt for not committed crime but wasn't trusted by the other. Sam calls Dean, talking about his theory, thinking the whole town is one big bloody *Werewolf* game, only way to end is to win or lose, so either all wolves are dead or all villagers are dead, tell them Jody is already convinced it's Dean. Dean/Cas both say it's not them, for once Dean slightly believe Cas and rethink theory, but then who is always in all scenes and have access to all jails and crime locations and can frame them if have to -- Jody. Dean/Cas convinced Jody is the wolf behind scene, possibly possessed, Sam warn them careful about the "kill on sight". Night falls.

day 6: over night, Jody is killed violently in the station, big gun fight, both Dean/Cas bloody in scene, weapons in hand, no memory of what happened, freaked out; Sam come to check station camera record, (rewind to) night 5: everyone forced to sleep, Jody is awake, on look out, (Dean thought it's a winning theory, the awake is the wolf), but Jody not attack (sheriff the real seer, deputy protecting seer), Cas enter scene, confront, Jody not attack, warn him of Dean, Cas not concerned, start attacking, Jody has to fight back, able to resist for a bit (Dean/Cas devasted Cas is indeed wolf, Dean point gun at Cas), Dean enter scene, Jody thought if Cas is bad then Dean must be good, ask for help, Dean smirk, help Cas instead, attack Jody together until she's dead (both devastated again both are bad guys); stunned looking at their hands, Jody's blood, Bobby devastated for they're good friends, but they really don't remember so does that make them villains (even got pointed, Cas doesn't point gun at Dean); the crowd (Marcy Ward, Sean Mills, Stephan Phelps math teacher, Henry the highschooler) gathering station, see Jody dead, convinced Dean/Cas killer, ready to kill them, Sean Mills (Jody's husband) has guns, shoot at Dean first, Cas instinctively jump before Dean, bullet through him then Dean's throat, Cas dead instantly, Dean gurgle in blood for thirty seconds longer, in disbelief Cas's dead for real, murmur "Cas", then watch sunset at exact second, energy wave sweep through the whole town, night falls

day 7: over night, no one dies, the town comes back normal, Dean wake up on the station floor, Cas grace self-heal slowly and wake up. ask what happened, Cas thinks because wolves stay awake over night so Dean survived the night by luck, they are both exposed, so game over (even though wolf lost), his grace comes back over night during the supposed wolf wake hour, so he gets to self-heal and eventually resurrect, all by luck (and still doesn't know why or who curse the whole town). and the killed over the seven days are still all dead, Sam suggest they leave town immediately, Bobby mourn Jody, Sean Mills still want to revenge. Jody resurrect, bringing message from "Death", it's a warning from Lucifer, telling them what would happen if they continue refuse to say yes to him, the whole world can be his fucking killing game, and disappointed his attempt of taking Cas out of the board (hopefully by Dean's hand) doesn't work, but maybe next time. TFW grimace, Dean glad they're alive, Sam solemn, they jump back into season 5 main task of finding ways to fight Lucifer. (hopeful canon-compliant ending)
