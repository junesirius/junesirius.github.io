Amy strikes a match. The dancing flame lightens up a tiny corner of the place, dark shadow looming in from every direction. Dean never knew a cellar could look so dreadful, boundless, and infinite.

They try to examine the space in the dim light.

There is a broken chandelier not far from the end of the stairs. The glasses shatter on the floor, leaving sharp pieces and shards all over like hidden blades, shimmering with flame's reflection. Another empty matchbox has been tipped upside down on the floor, a dozen charred match stumps scattering around it.

"Careful," Dean breathes. Amy startles, dropping the match.

The weak flame dies on the floor a second later. The utter black takes over. The sound of some distorted giggle and pitter-patter of small stone feet stepping on the broken glasses comes from the darkness.

They gasp together. Amy strikes a second match.

From the flickering light, they see a small group of cherub statues crowding in on them. The little stone babies, barely able to stand straight, lie around on the dusty floor, chubby little hands and legs entangled together. Looking as harmless and innocent as the ones from Bethesda Fountain looked initially. But they know better than being fooled by the look.

They stare at the cherubs, edging slowly backward on the stairs, ascending to where the door is. Amy moves on to higher steps. Dean follows her, keeping a barrier between her and the statues. His shadow stretches long in the faint flame and merges with the rest of the darkness.

Amy curses when the match burns her finger.

She drops the burned-down match and hurriedly strikes another.

The cherubs -- there are three of them -- have moved. They turned to where Dean and Amy are, frozen in the act of getting to their feet. Their tiny faces turn feral and full of fangs. Dean stares at them without blinking. But without a steady light source, this does very little help.

"We are dead," Amy says with a trembling, dreadful voice. "The stone babies are going to send us back in time, and we'll just die of old age somewhere in the past. I'm never going to see Rory again."

Tears stream down her face.

The match burns out again. Her quiet sob mixes with the creepy giggles.

"We'll find a way," Dean stumbles up a few steps on the stairs in the complete darkness, blindly looking for the way. "The smart people upstairs, your Doctor and my -- and Cas, they'll think of something. We just have to last until they come."

Amy lights another match with unsteady fingers.

The cherubs reached the lowest level of the stairs, and the two of them are on the highest, no more distance to put between them. The cellar door is shut tight and unmistakably latched from the outside, no way to open it from inside. Their lives are as long as the match lasts, until the baby statues climb up the stairs.

"How many matches left?" Dean asks.

"Does it matter?" Amy glances at the box and answers anyway, "Ten, maybe fifteen."

"Means one minute, maybe two." Dean thinks quickly.

He takes off his tie. "Burn this next," he tells her. "Should buy us another two minutes."

Dean starts taking off his suit.

"What are you doing?" Amy panics.

"Improvise," he holds the suit jacket like a muleta, descending the stairs cautiously. "Just keep the light going."

Amy does as she's told. The cotton tie burns from the end, the flame is more steady than the one from the matches, but it still burns too quickly.

"I liked that tie," Dean tells the cherubs in grudge, "and this suit. Now I need to get a new one, and it's your fault."

He covers the baby angel statues with his suit, kneeling down to turn over the bundle, tying the sleeves and the lower hem together in a dead knot. And then leaves the bundle in the middle of the shattered chandelier's glass shards on the floor.

The light goes out just as he finishes the work.

"Come back quickly," Amy urges him, striking another match.

Dean stares at the cloth bundle as he moves back to the top of the stairs. The bundle didn't move in the blink of darkness between the lights.

Between that match burning out and them lighting the next, the bundle still remains in the same place, not an inch closer to the bottom of the stairs than they were. They don't hear any giggle or pitter-patter either.

Amy lets out a long breath, "How do you know it would work?"

"I don't," Dean admits. "Lucky guess. Figured if they couldn't see us, they might lose the nerve to move, so I took my chance. Or at least it will be hell trying to climb up the stairs like that, have you seen a three-legged race?"

"Nice job," Amy sits down on the top step, still holding the matchbox tight. There are still perhaps about ten matches left, and she doesn't want to stop lighting, even just for ten seconds of comfort.

"Hey," Dean puts a tentative pat on her shoulder, "we'll be fine."

"Thanks." Amy nods once, jaw still tight, wiping her face. "You know, Doctor says that a lot too, even when we first met, he said to me, 'You know when grown-ups tell you everything's going to be fine, and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?' right before he said 'Everything's going to be fine.' I was only seven." She chuckles tightly at the memory.

"Was everything really fine then?" Dean asks gently, sitting down on the stairs one level lower than her. The cold cellar door is over their heads.

"Not really," Amy says, "there was a crack on my wall, which turned out to be a crack in the time and space, and then it killed Rory and wiped my memory, and he came back becoming a Roman robot, and we exploded the universe."

"Wow," Dean blinks, "that's gonna make my story of blowing up Hell and letting Lucifer out sound so lame. What happened next?"

Amy sniffs slightly, "We fixed it together. The Doctor saved the world, and we all went home. Rory and I got married, happily ever after."

Dean knows the sound of tears in a sentence when he hears one.

"And yet here you are --" He says slowly. He doesn't mean to pry, but it seems to calm her down.

"We tried," she tells him, "the normal life, we really tried when the Doctor was not around. Rory worked in a hospital; I had a blog. We spent a year in our house, watching a box." She trails off. Dean doesn't rush.

"It feels like yesterday," Amy continues, "it might actually *be* yesterday -- Tardis can send us back right when we left, so it would almost be like we never left. But then the Doctor would drop by again, have some dinner, or watch TV with us. He doesn't have to say anything but we know he can't just leave us, and to be honest, how can you -- how can *anyone* -- stop following him around, traveling through all the time and space, fighting monsters, saving the universe? This 'other life', we call it 'Doctor life', it's part of me now. I think it's always been."

"It's like the hunter life and the normal life," Dean murmurs quietly, realizing the similarity.

They decided to save all the remaining matches for the moment, sitting quietly in the darkness on the top stairs. The air is quiet with only their breath and low voice. If the statues manage to shake off the wrap and move again, they should be able to hear them first. So for now, in the quietness and the darkness, they should be safe. Dean just wishes Cas and the rest of them could figure things out quickly on the other side of this heavy cellar door.

"You are a hunter?" Amy asks.

Dean nods, then remembers she can't see him in the darkness. "Yeah," he admits, "not really an FBI agent, sorry. Should have done a proper introduction back there. Hi, I'm Dean Winchester. I'm a hunter."

He holds out a hand in the dark blindly, meeting Amy's in the middle.

"Amy Pond, I'm um -- a traveler, or an adventurer, I guess."

They shake their hands.

"And the dude with me is Castiel, Angel of the Lord."

Amy stiffens reflexively when the word "angel" is mentioned. Dean notices it from the hands they connected.

"Sorry," he says quickly, "you know, it sounds really strange, the Weeping Angel and the actual angel I know, I was so used to angels being only dudes in suits like him."

Amy nods in understanding, then asks, "Are other angels all like him?"

"No, there is no one like him," Dean answers automatically. "He's..." he trails off temporarily, staring at the dark space. "He saved me from Hell, he rebelled, he fell. He died so many times, but he always comes back to me, always helps me when I need him. Yeah, he's the only one like that." A small smile crawls onto his lips that no one sees.

"Rory is like that, too," Amy tells him. "I lost count of how many times he's... gone." She chokes. The blackness brings the truth out easily. "You know, I crashed a van once, after he was killed. Because I decided, if that was a world I had to live without him, I don't want it. I wasn't sure how I felt about him until he was gone, and at that time, I never even told him I loved him. I don't know what I'd do without him. And lucky for me, it turned out to be an evil Dream Lord's dream world. I was so happy we got a second chance, then third, then fourth. I lost count. Rory was taken from me a lot, but he always comes back."

Dean stares at the pure darkness before his eyes, blinking hard, thinking he must be hallucinating to see images flashing by on the black curtain -- the rain of exploded flesh and blood, the floating trench coat on the lake water, the hand slipping from his palm. "I know what you mean," he replies, his voice hoarse.

He can feel Amy turn her head to him, cloth rustling. If they can see, her eyes must be searching his face.

Silence falls between them. They breathe shallowly and slowly. There is no sound or light in the cellar, as if time and the universe don't exist in this small space.

Then Amy speaks again. "I've never been loved by anyone like that before; it terrifies me," she says slowly. "We grew up together, I've known him my entire life, and then he waited two thousand years for me, alone, to save me. I didn't even know." There is the sound of tears dropping to the floor. She whispers, "He died for me so many times. How can you love back someone who loves you like that? Is that even possible?"

Dean swallows hard. "I don't know." His voice is a croak. "You save him back, whatever it takes."

Amy wipes her face, "You're right, now you get it why I *have* to save him. And," she pauses for a beat, "if for whatever reason I fail, or I get killed, or sent away by the Weeping Angels --"

"Amy --"

"Let me finish," Amy's voice is now firm and steady, though still wet, "can you promise to save him for me, and tell him that I loved him, and that I'm sorry, I tried, I died trying?"

"I --"

"Please?"

"Okay," Dean swallows the lump in his throat. "Okay. Amy Pond, I promise you. Is that why you're telling me all that?"

"I don't know, just in case," Amy says, a lot calmer than before. "And I will try my best to do the same for you and Castiel, if the worst comes."

She strikes a match right then, flashing bright both their solemn faces.

"What?" Dean is surprised, staring into her sparkling eyes.

"I'm not blind, Dean," she says, looking into his eyes, "I see the way you two look at each other. It's the same way Rory looks at me, every single time."

The match burns out.

Dean can hear blood pumping in his eardrum, deafening him, muting him completely.

Except, it's not the pounding of his heart that he's hearing.

The cellar door above their heads is punched from the other side. There are noises of fighting and yelling, and then a gun shot. Metal dropping on the surface, something heavy collapsing onto the floor shortly after. Dean's heart clutches in worry.

"Amy!" The Doctor shouts, followed by a series of familiar metallic whirling sounds from the sonic screwdriver. "Amy, if you're in there, stay clear!"

Amy and Dean hurry back down a few steps in the darkness, covering their ears, looking up at their way out, waiting.

"Dean!" Cas's voice passes through the noise.

"Cas." Dean's heart skips a beat, jumping too lightly. Cas is okay, and he's coming for him, again.

The cellar door is blasted open, two metal plates flying into the space. Dean covers Amy with his body, getting a harsh hit on the back, throwing both of them down to the bottom of the stairs.

"Amy!" The Doctor thunders down, beaming the sonic screwdriver at the dark space like a torch, pulling Amy into a tight hug.

"Doctor," she clutches on his jacket, "it's so nice to see you again."

Cas follows into the cellar in a rush, looking around, asking in s tense voice, "Where is Dean?"

Amy turns sharply, pointing behind her, "He's right here --"

But there is no one there. The air is empty where they landed from the blast.

The chilling giggles echo in the dark shadow.

"Angels." The Doctor hurries backward, taking Amy's arm, leading her back onto the stairs.

He points his sonic screwdriver lower, its green light shining on the broken chandelier. On the floor, near a wall by a pile of shattered glasses, a ragged suit jacket lies open, two cherub statues frozen in their gaze.
