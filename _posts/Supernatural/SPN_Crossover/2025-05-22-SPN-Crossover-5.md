It's not the first time Dean get flied around in a wing-trip, but this is certainly the top five most unpleasant journey. He doesn't remember the other times being so dizzy and nauseous. Even worse than the crash landing in the Tardis the very same afternoon earlier.

The color and lights are muffled into a big kaleidoscope around him, spinning in speed higher than his eyes and brain can possibly process. He really should have closed his eyes.

When his feet touch the ground in the rattled sound of wings fluttering, Dean stumbles to the ground on all fours, vomiting his breakfast burger and fries out.

"Cas, that's hell of a fly." He wipes his mouth, looking around.

The night is dark, the road has wet puddles from a recent rain. The lamp dimly lights the street, showing vintage cars parked in front of a glamorous mansion, statues standing across the street to it.

The Doctor and Amy are scrambling up from the ground just like him, recovering from an inelegant landing. The Doctor points his sonic screwdriver in all directions, making that small buzzing sound again, looks like trying to get a reading on the thin air.

"Where is Cas?" Dean sweeps around their landing point, then notices a small movement on the side of a parked car. He catches a glimpse of tan color and rushes there.

Cas slumps against the side of the car, eyes closed, panting heavily. His face is pale, his chest heaving and falling. Scratches of cuttings and bleeding marks all over his bare skin and clothes, more bloody wounds under the torn shirts and pants. A smear of blood at the corner of his mouth.

Dean is instantly reminded of the last time Cas is weakened severely by a flight, kicking himself mentally for forgetting how much it always seem to exhaust him.

He shakes Cas on the shoulder gently, trying not to let the worry leaking everywhere in his voice, "Hey man, how you holding up?"

Cas opens his eyes with a moan, eyes dazed for a moment before focusing on Dean's face. "Been better." he says, wiping his mouth, only to smudge the blood stain worse.

"Is it Naomi?" Dean asks, using his own cuff to help Cas clean up.

Cas shakes his head slightly, "It's the time flux itself. It's so... chaotic." He looks for a word to describe, then lands on -- "Scrambled. Too many Weeping Angels, we are not safe." Just like the Doctor has guessed before.

Amy comes over too, "How's he doing?"

The Doctor cuts in before Dean can answer, "Imagine when Tardis crashed, it's like trying to land a plane in a blizzard, and now? He's like a bird going through that same storm, no helmet, no seatbelt! And carry three passengers!" His voice is impressed.

"And he did it." Amy murmurs quietly, kneeling down next to Cas, looking at his face closely. "You did it, you brought us all here. Thank you!" She says it whole-heartedly, then turns to Dean, "He'll be okay, right?"

"He'll be fine," Dean says, waving a hand at her, "Why don't you and Doc go ahead looking for your man, I'll help him catch a breath first. He'd need enough strength for the trip home."

Amy nods appreciatedly, moving to check with the Doctor.

"Can you heal?" Dean asks with concern.

"Naomi." Cas answers with one word and Dean gets the rest -- yes about the healing power, no because using it would be dangerous. Only the slow, natural healing then. He nods.

Cas holds an arm on the wet ground, making an effort trying to stand up. Dean holds his other arm, helping him on his feet.

Cas wobbles a little, but he manages to stand straight.

"It's too dangerous out here," his voice croaked, tone warning, "They can be anywhere, any statues." He nods at across street, Dean follows his sight, seeing two statues standing in the light lit from the mansion, the statues of a mother and a son.

"He's right, too much temporal disturbance, I can't get a good reading," the Doctor says, swinging the sonic screwdriver a few times like trying vainly to fix an used-up pen. "Let's go inside first."

"You good to walk, man?" Dean asks under his breath, stilling holding Cas up like supporting an old man to cross streets.

Cas answers him, "I'm not fragile, Dean."

Dean doesn't move his hands away until they reach the building.

<br>

The giant beautiful classic architecture in front of them is the biggest, most likely the richest house they can see around the place, and best of all, the brightest, with the most light -- where they can for sure see the Weeping Angels coming if they dare try.

Amy knocks at the door.

It takes long minutes for the guards to open at least half a dozen locks behind the door, and it's pushed open with only enough of a slit to show the guards' eyes. "Mr. Grayle does not expect more guests tonight."

"Tell him we are with the guests he already had." The Doctor answers.

The guards mutter quietly between themselves, probably waiting for a confirmation from higher authority.

They wait impatiently for a few minutes, Dean can't help himself. "Oh come on, it's taking too long."

He moves to the door, pulling out his badge, "FBI inspection, open the door."

The guards back away from behind the door immediately, open it wilder for them to enter, and relock each one of them quickly.

"Mr. Grayle is on the second floor with the Detective." the guards inform them.

They don't really need the guide to know where to find the owner of the place. The study on the second floor is dazzling bright, as if the man has spent half his fortune on collecting all the brightest light source in the world to put together, keeping the place as bright as day time.

They follow the ancient spiral stairs to the second floor and march into the study. A fleshy, boastful-looking man in fancy suit stands in front of the desk, a woman near a corner alcove by the wall.

Dean walks into the room, flashing his FBI badge at the people in the room, announcing, "I'm Agent Plant. This is my partner, Agent Page."

He turns his head slightly at Cas, giving him a meaningful glance. Cas pulls out his badge like Dean did with a straight face -- the badge is displayed upside down.

Dean lets out a quiet sigh, correcting it for him. Cas murmurs, "Is it really necessary, Dean?"

And Dean looks down at his own badge, putting it away with another sigh. "Not really", he says, "'cause I read from a book they already knew it's fake. Just testing."

The woman looks at them with a small amused mockery, "That certainly looks fake to me."

Her eyes shift quickly toward the Doctor and Amy behind them, the grin turning into a wild smile, "Hello, Sweetie." her eyes sparkle with joy of the reunion, "Took you long enough."

The Doctor tilts his head slightly, meeting with a similar smile, "Sorry, I'm late, hon -- traffic was hell."

"How did you get here then?" The woman raises her left arm, showing a dark colored device on her wrist. While her right wrist -- Dean only notices now, after getting used to the lighting in the room -- is grasped tight by a Weeping Angel statue locked to the alcove wall. The statue looks more feral than the Angel of Water or any of the cherubs, it doesn't hide its face with palms, so all the fangs and wild fierce look is written clearly in each line and crack on its face. It looks angry -- furious, perhaps -- which might have something to do with the long heavy chains that tether it to the plinth and the wall.

"No way Tardis can land in time turbulence like this, not even I can do that. And I took the vortex manipulator. So then how did you?" the woman asks curiously, not giving the Angel holding her a second look, as if she's not noticing the dangerous situation she's in.

"We got some help from new friends." the Doctor taps Dean and Cas on the shoulders lightly. Dean is a little surprised at the word choice he uses, but he's not complaining.

"I see." the woman regards them, not hiding at all the way her eyes checking both of them up and down. Not in an uncomfortable way. More curious than anything.

Dean meets her eyes while hers linger on his face. Dean notices at the same time how attractive and sexy she looks, and for some reason, familiar. He tries to scratch the memory where he might know her from -- the tight leather jacket, the bright red lips, all cleavage and curves -- he gasps with realization, nudges Cas and whispers, "She's the one from the book."

"What book?" The woman watches him closely.

"Enough babbling," the rich man -- must be the called Mr. Grayle -- steps into the center of the room, bossing, "What's going on? Who are you? Detective Malone, I demand answers!"

"Shush, grown-ups are talking." The woman shoots him a stern look with enough might, as if *she* is the owner of the place. The man shuts his mouth unbelievably.

"*You* are Melody Malone?" Cas catches up too, realizing what Dean's saying.

"How did *you* know River is Melody?" Amy asks instead.

Cas answers River, "I found your book in our motel, and our names are in it."

He pulls the book out of his pocket and passes it over to Amy. The cover looks exactly like River.

"A book I haven't written yet." River glances at it, making a face, "I don't like the cover."

The Doctor stares at Cas, "And you didn't think to mention it earlier?"

Dean defends, "We didn't even know what that is."

"All the more reasons." River says calmly.

Amy opens the pages.

Grayle runs up all his patience, raising his voice, "Okay I have enough of this nonsense. Guards! Get them out of here!"

"I wouldn't suggest that." The Doctor warns with a low voice.

The two hefty guards they met at the gate burst into the room, each having a gun in their hands, pointing menacingly at them.

Dean draws out his own gun, pointing at the taller one among the two. Cas steps closer to him, raising a palm in a defending gesture. River pulls out an alien-looking tiny gun with her free left hand. The Doctor steps in front of her and Amy, pointing at the guards with his sonic screwdriver like a weapon.

"Very West Side Story." Dean comments, "What now? You're outnumbered."

"Not if I let the Angels in." Grayle threatens with a vicious smile.

"Risk sending yourself back in time? You wouldn't dare." The Doctor reads his face.

"How would you know?" Grayle challenges.

"There are awful lot of locks on the door downstairs. And the blinding light here." The Doctor points out flatly, meeting the man's mousey eyes, "You're scared. Which is good. Scare is good, means you know they're dangerous. Because they *are*, beyond your puny little head's understanding. They are dangerous, they are patient, and they are fast, faster than any of us. No one stand a chance when they attack."

Grayle opens his palms, gesturing arrogantly at the luxurious ancient-looking decorations and collections displayed around them, then at the chained statue at the alcove that still grips River's wrist, "Except I'm a collector. And you know what, they make the perfect collection. Now, why don't you do as I say, or you watch *her* suffer."

He flips the light switch on the wall before they can say anything. River gasps in the sudden darkness. All the lights are turned back on a second later.

The chained angel statue has moved in that blink of darkness. It dragged River closer to its body, the grip on her wrist is so tight and powerful that her whole arm is twisted outward in an odd angle. The Angel's right arm raises high with all the long claw nails out -- it's on the rim of a striking pose and there is no way to run. River grits her teeth, cursing loudly, "Damn you!"

"I hope you take it seriously now," Grayle smiles meaningfully at the rest of them, "One more flip, the Angel can snap her neck."

"What do you want?" The Doctor has burning fire in his eyes, his voice cold like ice.

"Those two, take them to the babies." The man talks to the guards, gesturing to Dean and Amy.

Dean shifts his gun toward him, "Or I can just blast a hole on your chest." He spits.

"I assure you," Grayle says in his greasy voice, "I can flip the switch before you pull the trigger."

"Please, don't." The Doctor lowers his voice, Dean realizes he's talking to him. "And please take care of Amy, we'll come to you as soon as we can."

"Take me with them, then." The words surprise many of them, and it is Cas, stepping toward Grayle. "I'm no use to you here, let me go with them."

Grayle sizes him up with interest, glancing between him and Dean.

"Cas --" Dean has lowered his weapon, let himself grabbed by the arm by the guard he pointed gun to earlier. The other man takes Amy, shoving her out.

Dean manages to turn his head and meet Cas's eyes even as he is pushed out of the door. "Cas, I'll be fine. Don't do anything stupid."

He only gets time to see Cas's deeply worried eyes and creased furrows one more time, before he gets hustled downstairs, into the cellar -- more like dungeon, to be precise.

The guards dump them both into the utterly dark space, the only light coming from the open door.

"The lights are out --" the tall one leers at them from the top of the stairs, "you'll last longer with those."

A box of matches are thrown into the place, landing on the floor next to Amy's feet.

"What do you care?" Dean asks furiously.

"It's funnier." He grins with teeth, shutting the door. There is the sound of bolts slammed.

The place is drown by total darkness.
