Birds chatter noisily around the tables, chirping cheerfully while fighting for the food crumbs on the ground. Apparently the chilliness of early autumn in the city is not enough to keep them quiet or away, nor is the man sitting by the table, protecting his French fries from these thieves.

Dean shoos at the birds, waving a hand aggressively, trying to keep his meal as safe as he can.

"Maybe if you feed them some, they'd just leave," Cas says from the other side of the table, not looking up from the book he's reading.

"No, then they'd just all come asking for a piece and I don't have anything left to eat!" Dean takes a large bite of the French fries in his hand, chewing as if for revenge. "Look at them, that must be how they end up all glossy and fleshy, I don't think I've ever seen pigeons in any other place rounder than them."

Cas looks up to observe the pigeons at his words, agreeing with a quiet hum. The pigeons are indeed looking very healthy and well-fed. He looks back at his book, turning a page.

"Man, I'm telling you, New York, even the pigeons are richer." Dean grins.

"I'm not sure that's true," Cas answers with a serious face. "There are poor people in this city."

Dean barks a laugh. "It's good to have you back, Cas. Speaking of, how do you feel? You know, after Purgatory puke me out, I'm still trying to find my sea legs. It's only been, what, a week?"

Cas keeps his eyes on the book, his shoulders stiffen a little, voice quieter. "I feel fine. And if you don't mind, I'd rather *not* think about the angels that have to siege the Purgatory to save me -- against my will -- and I have to, *again*, fight them off to run away. I already tried my best not to harm any more of them, but I think some of them were still hurt because of me; some were even my friends. If it's not for me, Inias and Hannah wouldn't ever be in the Purgatory. I didn't even have time to check if they survived the incursion. And there are more that didn't --"

"That's not your fault, you know that, right, Cas?" Dean lowers his voice too, glancing around, more self-aware now that they are in the middle of a sea of ordinary humans. "It's a good thing you get to run away before that Naomi bitch can do anything to you, whatever she has in mind. Let's keep it that way."

Cas gives a small nod in agreement, his shoulders slack.

"Now let me just finish my food and we'll get back to work." Dean swallows down the food, and takes another exaggeratedly huge bite of the burger, sighing with satisfaction.

Cas glances at him with a small smile.

"Miss the food and everything." Dean talks with food in his mouth, gesturing to their surroundings, "Not like Purgatory has any Michelin stars or anything."

Sunlight shines on the shade above their table, bright color glittering through the leaves. The diner's outdoor seating is already overbusy and crowded, even though it's way earlier than usual lunch hour. The street is jammed with vehicles of all kinds, cars and buses and pedestrians moving in all directions. It seems this city is just soaked with life at every possible space, at any time.

"Maybe we can come here more often if you like it so much," Cas offers. "Not only when there are cases."

"Nah, big towns aren't really our thing," Dean dismisses, stuffing down the rest of the burger, licking his fingers for the last bit of taste of fries and salt. "There is a reason we don't go to big-name places like Los Angeles or New York. The loose ends can bite."

Cas nods quietly. "I understand."

Dean wipes his mouth as he finishes, and throws the used paper napkin on the plate, "Now, where are we?"

Cas blinks. "We are in Josie's Burger near Central Park."

Dean tries to muffle the laugh and sigh that are fighting in his throat. "Yes, we are. I mean, where are we on the case?"

"Same as last night," Cas pulls out a piece of newspaper folded between the book pages, spreading it on the least oily corner of the table. The missing people notice takes half the page, and the page after that shows a photo of some local cemetery. The title reads "Death Earlier Than Birth."

"That sure is an eye-catching title, I'll give you that," Dean nods at the flourishing inky letters, turning the paper one hundred and eighty degrees so he doesn't need to read upside down. "How many missing people so far?"

"Ten until yesterday, we don't know if there are more in the past twenty-four hours," Cas answers.

"The earliest missing is a week ago." Dean checks the handwritten notes on the margin. They have managed to do some digging, but not enough to connect the dots yet.

"About the same time when I came back," Cas says what's on both their minds.

"You thinking what I'm thinking?" Dean says. Their eyes meet.

"That angels have something to do with that?" Cas frowns.

"Possible, cemetery and death stuff, could be your department. I can't see any connections between the victims. You got anything about the tombs and statues?"

"Reports said some statues move the place or pose, and the dates on some of the tombs are obviously wrong. The police found three new tombs with the missing people's names on them, but the dates of death are earlier than their dates of birth; therefore, 'Death earlier than birth'."

"People with the same names?" Dean suggests.

"Three pairs of people with the same names? Too many coincidences, don't you think?" Cas narrows his eyes.

"New York is a big city," Dean shrugs, though he doesn't buy the theory either. Since when do they have the luck that things are *just a coincidence* anyway?

"So what should we do?" Cas asks, his fingers absently fidgeting with the corner of the book. "Shall we call Sam?"

"Nah, we can handle it without him." Dean's face is unreadable for a moment. "He got what he wanted, an apple-pie life with a pretty woman, don't think I can do it again to rob him of that kind of life. He'd probably just punch me in the face if I showed up on the doorsteps of his white-fence house."

"Dean, I don't think --"

"Cas." Dean doesn't let him finish, giving him a stern look that means "drop the topic." Cas falls silent.

"He made his choice." Dean keeps his voice cold and steady. "For once, I'm respecting that. It's just you and me now."

Cas sighs, grabs the book and is ready to stand up from the diner seat. "Alright. Where are we going next?"

"To the cemetery -- want to check out those tombs first. Maybe we can find something the police missed. Ask around the victim's family later -- routine questions." Dean stands up, straightening his FBI suit, gesturing for Cas to follow. "Only a few blocks away, we can cross Central Park. Come on."

They walk out of the diner, merging into the ocean of pedestrians on the streets.

Dean leans closer to avoid them getting separated by the crowd.

Cas tucks the book under his arm.

Dean regards his move closely when their elbows bump, looking him up and down, then landing his gaze on the book, as if he only starts to notice it now. "Where did you get that book?"

"What, this one?" Cas follows his gaze, flipping the book over to show him the cover. The title reads "Melody Malone," with a drawing of a sexy lady detective in a sheathy leather jacket, her face hidden in the shadow of a large detective hat, only showing red lips kissing a smoking gun.

"I like the cover," Dean comments with a small smile, taking the book and skimming random pages, "looks like some old-time detective novel."

"Yes, it is. It's a rather intriguing story about a private detective in old town New York." Cas confirms. "I found it in the motel drawer."

Dean turns to the back cover, reading out: "New York growled at my window. A friend once told me this was the town of a million stories.

"Some nights I felt like they were all happening to me. This was one of those nights.

"But what the hell -- my stocking seams were straight, my lipstick was combat-ready, and I was packing cleavage that could fell an ox at twenty feet."

He looks up from the blurb, amused, "Whoever wrote this, I like her. 'Packing cleavage that could fell an ox at twenty feet!' Look at that!"

Some passers-by glance at them with curious eyes, probably overhearing the last bit.

Cas lowers his voice, "Why do you read it out?"

"I don't know, why do you read it at all?" Dean thumbs the pages casually, eyes gleaming with mischief.

"I believed it to be a tour guide. I have considered that maybe it can help us know more about New York or the case. Though later it is only for the joy of reading -- It's a rather fascinating story about statues." Cas admits.

But Dean has stopped listening. He slowly straightens his back, grabbing the opened page with too much force on the knuckles. His eyes focus dead on the printed texts. His steps frozen.

Cas drags him off the street, leading them onto a smaller road quiet enough to talk.

"What is it, Dean?" Cas hurries in his most worried voice.

Dean reads out the lines he's staring at: "A handsome young man walks into the room, flashing a clearly fake FBI badge before our eyes, saying with probably his most persuasive, charming smile, 'I'm Agent Plant. This is my partner, Agent Page.'

"The man next to him in a raggedy trench coat has the bluest eyes I've ever seen, and looks like he barely survived a blast. He pulls out a similar badge from his suit, displaying it upside down.

"The first man sighs and corrects it for him, and the second man murmurs some words that are actually loud enough for us to hear: 'Is it really necessary, Dean?'

"And Dean answers with another sigh: 'Not really, 'cause I read from the book they already knew it's fake.'"
