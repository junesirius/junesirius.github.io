There are too many unused materials that are drafted out for chapters that end up not being included in the final story. But many of them are so much fun that I'd hate to leave them out in the void. Mostly witty quips and comments and fun little interactions between our crossover characters. I can't resist compiling them together, just for some amusement.

<br>

### Chapter 4

Dean: Let me get this straight. You save the universe, but only save the UK part? Flying across the galaxy is close enough, but the USA is too far away? This isn't your jurisdiction or something?

Dean: Pal, not I'm saying, you did a terrible job in protecting the Earth, in case you didn't notice, it was at least trashed twice if it's not for us to save it.

The Doctor: With all due respect, whose fault is that? Also, the USA almost trashed twice doesn't mean *I* didn't do my job. That's *your* job, technically.

River: Don't mind him, London gets trashed every Christmas, it's a Doctor and Monster thing.

Dean: You can say that again.

<br>

Dean: (referring to the Doctor & River) I guess a thousand year age gap isn't a problem then.

The Doctor/River: You got anything you want to say about that?

Dean: What? No, no, of course not.

(Dean unintentionally glances at Cas, finding him looking at him, too.)

River: We were married when I was halfway killing him and he was trying to save the world. It's complicated.

Dean: (grins) Isn't it always? (unintentionally meets Cas's eyes again)

Cas: (referring to Dean) When we first met, he shot me and stabbed a dagger in my heart.

Dean: (quickly) Sorry.

Cas: (small, amused grin) It's okay. It's forgiven. It couldn't harm me anyway.

River: (to Dean) If it did, you'd be in so much loss now.

Dean: (to River, referring to the Doctor) Same for you, I see. Either you didn't do a good job, or he just keeps coming back.

<br>

When they first enter the Tardis:

Cas: It says "Pull to open", why do all of you push?

The Doctor: With all those people coming to the Tardis, you're the first one who actually read the sign.

Cas: I didn't read actually, she complained to me.

Dean: "She"? Three minutes in, you're already bestie with a machine? Classic.

Cas: What can I say? She doesn't have many people to talk to.

The Doctor: I talk to her! Everyday!

Cas: (small smile) Yes, and she enjoys it. But you never listen.

<br>

When they first approach the Tardis's console, seeing all the buttons, handles, sliders, keyboards, displays, trumpet, glass floor, power cables, and electrical lines. Dean's so happy like kids running into a toy store, can't help touching all those toys. There's even an old-style vintage typewriter. Dean really wants to touch them.

The Doctor: Don't touch anything. (Even though his back to him)

Dean is disappointed, taking his hand back. But Cas sees he still manages to press on the button closest to him. It blinks blue a few times, but does nothing else. Dean looks like a happy kid with a new toy.

<br>

When warning about the Weeping Angels:

The Doctor: Don't blink. Don't look them in the eyes.

Dean: What's wrong with their eyes?

Amy: Trust me, you don't want to know.

Dean glances at Cas, looking him in the eyes. Then belatedly realizing they're doing the staring thing again, Dean thinks: So glad Cas isn't a Weeping Angel, or all the staring in the eyes thing is going to be so much trouble.

<br>

### Chapter 5

Dean: What do we do, Doc?

The Doctor: Don't call me "Doc", it's "Doctor" to you.

<br>

### Chapter 6

When Amy and Dean talk, Amy mentions she and Rory got married.

Dean: Why did you get married?

Amy: How can you not?

Dean chokes, blushes, glad they are in the dark and no one can see his face.

<br>

In a setting where the six of them are all in the same room, just freshly met each other, and can talk relaxingly (which ends up never happens in the story until the very end and their relationship dynamics have already changed):

Dean: (referring to Amy & Rory) So you two are married.

Cas: (referring to the Doctor & River) You two are also married.

Amy: (referring to Dean & Cas) And you are --?

Dean: (hurriedly) No, no, we, uh, we are best friends.

Amy: Sure.

River: Thought I heard you said you're partners.

Dean: What? The agent thing? No, no, that's just, a partner-in-crime kinda thing.

Cas: Dean --

Dean: Yeah, sorry, you're right, made it worse. No, it's like, colleagues, (Cas narrows his eyes) comrades, (Amy raises her eyebrows) family.

River: Sure.

Dean: You know what, forget it, just friends. Cas is my best friend, that's all. Drop it.

Amy: (puts up two hands, surrender) Just asking, as long as you guys figured it out, no problem with me.

River: (to Cas) That's good enough for you?

Cas: Why wouldn't it be?

Dean: (cheerfully) See? All sorted out now, no problem at all.

(Dean meets Cas's eyes, he looks away.)

<br>

### Chapter 11

They are ready to wrap up and say their goodbyes:

River: (fake begrudgingly) Great, all of you are done with work, and I still have a book to write.

The Doctor: Not like it's so heavy work. You've already written it!

River: I still have to drop it off somewhere. Needs to be in the exact motel room those boys stayed in at the exact right time. Not an easy job.

Dean: At least you gotta visit Manhattan again. Even the cheapest hotel around here is like a 5-star penthouse. Do you know you literally can't live anywhere that's *not* one block away from some famous landmarks around here?

River: That's Manhattan, alright.

<br>

### Epilogue

When Amy and Rory talk with Brian:

Brian: Life will still be here.

The Doctor: You could come, too, Brian.

Brian: Somebody has to water the plants. Just... bring them back safe.

The Doctor: You could bring the plants, too. Come on, Brian. The Tardis needs you.

Rory: (whispers) He means he needs us, and we need you.

Brian: I'll go packing then.
