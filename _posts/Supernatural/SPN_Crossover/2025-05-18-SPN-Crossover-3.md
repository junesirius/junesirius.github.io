They stare at each other, eyes wide with disbelief and -- if Dean's honest with himself -- a little bit of horror.

"How's that possible?" Dean gasps and rereads the paragraph.

He reaches inside his suit pocket for the badge, which he already knew without really needing to double-check would show "Agent Plant," as well as Cas's would be "Agent Page."

"How can we possibly appear in a book that you found in a random motel drawer, that's probably been there forever?" Dean stares at Cas unbelievably, shaking his head. His fingers turn the book to the next page, just about to read what's next, when Cas suddenly grabs the book from him, slamming the pages shut.

"No, Dean! We can't read anymore." Cas clutches the book's spine hard. "I think -- I wish I'm wrong -- but I think time travel is involved here. The book might have the past that is going to be our future. We can't read early."

"But maybe it can help us save those missing people, solve the mystery?" Dean raises his eyebrows, "It might have all the answers we are looking for."

"And if we read and find you're dead?" Cas's voice turns harsh.

Dean swallows, but he doesn't back down, "Then we change it. We change the time and fate and everything all the time. Remember Titanic?"

Cas snorts a self-mockery laugh, "Exactly, and see how that turns out."

"But you fixed it." Dean pats him on the shoulder encouragingly, "I'm sure we can figure something out too this time even if the worst comes."

Cas lowers his head, "I just don't want to make any more mistakes. Can we at least take it slowly? Maybe only read when we absolutely have to."

Dean thinks about that, "Alright, don't ever say I never listen to you. Right now, how about we stick to the original plan then?"

They emerge back to the busy 72nd St., heading to Central Park.

<br>

The hustle and bustle of the city is blocked out the moment they walk into the green space of Central Park. Ten minutes in, and they almost forget they are still in the middle of the most abustle cities in the world.

People are jogging, or running, or walking dogs. In a plaza, a group of opera singers are rehearsing maybe some grand performances in the future. Artists set up sketch stands by the roadside, painting the view onto white papers. Tourists with heavy backpacks take photos of everything -- pinecones falling from the trees, commemorative sculptures of historical figures, cute dogs passing by, landmarks of the city. With the tree crowns covering the sky, even the highest skyscrapers of Manhattan is out of view.

Dean sniffs the air long and slow.

The air smells green and fresh.

"Do you sometimes think nothing bad can happen in places like this?" Dean can't help asking. "It's like, places like this are too bright and happy to be intruded by dark, nasty monsters. Monsters are in caves and undergrounds, the dark places under the bed or in closets, they'd never come to beautiful sunshine places like this."

"I certainly hope that is true." Cas nods.

They walk past the crowds, taking a short cut through the underpass in Bethesda Terrace. The fountain splashes under the bright sun, an angel statue standing on the very top. Not many people around the fountain today, only a couple of old people strolling slowly. A busker is singing some beautiful folk songs with a weathered guitar. Cas leaves a twenty dollar bill in his opened guitar box.

"That's Hannah," Cas points at the angel statue on the fountain when they pass it. "I know her."

"What, really? A real angel?" Dean takes a second look at the statue. The female figure looks more human than any angel he came to know in the past few years, wearing a long silky robe instead of in any suits. A pair of wings stretching from her shoulders. "No harp or halo?"

Cas's eyes are still on the static statue, as if he's looking at something *inside* the statue that Dean can't see. "Not her true form, but the statue, that's for Angel of Water. And water is her charge. I think I can even hear her just from the statue, I don't know it's possible."

"And those are her children?" Dean points at the four small baby angels around the base of the fountain.

"The cherubs?" Cas shifts his attention to those chubby little statues, "No, she doesn't have any children. I think those are just human imagination of what cherubs look like, wrong as always. They are not impotent babies wearing diapers, much like cupids."

"Yeah I remember that naked dude two three years ago." Dean chuckles at the memory.

"They're good arts with nice names, nonetheless." Cas tilts his head, examining them carefully.

"They have names?" Dean asks curiously.

"Of course they do. You humans have a habit of naming everything." Cas answers casually. "They are Peace, Health, Purity, and Temperance."

"Like dogs. I get it." Dean nudges him gently. "Come on, let's keep moving."

Cas follows him, but he glances back shortly again. "For some reason I think they're alive." He frowns lightly, a little confused.

"What, like the statues are talking to you?" Dean eyes him from the side.

"More like giggling. Are you sure you can't hear anything?"

Dean listens carefully for a moment. "Nope, only the dude singing." He nods at the busker. "Nice voice."

A man walks past them, holding three coffees in his hands, struggling to keep balance.

Cas looks back at the cherubs one more time, and he stops his steps.

"Oh come on, you have eyes on your back or something?" Dean stops too, turning around when he finds Cas didn't keep up.

"I have eyes in all directions, but not on this vessel's back." Cas answers seriously, his frown deepens. "Dean, look."

That's Cas's "there is something seriously wrong here" voice.

Dean is on guard immediately. "What is it?"

"The cherubs, they are gone."

Cas is right. The base of the fountain is bare now. The Angel of Water -- Hannah -- on top of the fountain stays standing, water spouting from the top and arching into the pool below, but the place where the four cherub statues were, it's empty now.

"Okay, weird." Dean says slowly, moving in the trained scouting gait, stepping up trying to take a closer look at the statue.

"Wait, Dean." Cas grabs his arms before he can take another step, "There's something else wrong --"

Dean meets his eyes, nervous and alarmed. Their pupils shrink. It's so quiet he can almost hear his own breathing.

Dean whispers, "Since when did the music stop?"

They snap their heads toward the busker. The place only has a lone guitar box on the ground.

"He's gone." Cas says.

"Yeah I can see that." Dean steps back slowly, away from the fountain, swallowing hard. "What the hell's happening?"

A distorted giggling sound echoes from behind them, together with some tiny little patters.

Dean whispers, "Please tell me I'm hallucinating, but does that sound like tiny stone babies running and laughing to you?"

Cas meets his eyes, nodding. "That's what I heard earlier."

"Hello? Did you hear anything?" A man asks behind them. Dean almost jumps.

"Jesus!" He glances back. It's the same guy passing them minutes ago. His hands still occupied with too many coffee cups.

"The giggling? Yes." Cas answers him.

The Coffee Guy is visibly relieved for a moment. "Oh great," he says, in an English accent, "I thought I was imagining things. I think something odd is happening here."

"You think?" Dean pointedly nods at the busker's guitar box. Cas checks on the angel fountain again.

"Do you know anything about it?" Cas asks without looking back, but doesn't hear any answer.

"Cas!" Dean yells with a hitched voice, grabbing him backward with large steps.

The Coffee Guy has disappeared from the thin air. Where he was standing, on the ground, there are the four missing cherub statues, frozen in a fumbling, crawling shape, just like some frozen frame of playful little babies having fun in their own way.

They back away quickly, keeping their eyes on the statues.

"Guess we find the missing cherubs, at least." Dean says, breathing fast.

"Not funny, Dean." Cas says.

"Not laughing." Dean replies. "Long shot, but, any chance you know what's happening here? Anything to do with angels?"

"They are not really angels, they are just statues." Cas stares at the cherubs. They remain still in his gaze. "They're not real. How can they possibly be alive?"

"I'm not sure 'alive' is the right term here." Dean glances back to check how much farther they can back away before hitting anything. "I have a theory but I don't want to test it."

"Dean?" Cas glances quickly at Dean then looks back at the stones. The cherubs have moved in that split of a second when he's not looking. They moved closer to them, small chubby arms reaching out like babies asking for a cradle, mouths opening, tiny fangs showing at the edge of the lips.

Dean gasps again when he looks back, dragging both of them hurried away farther from the statues. "Don't look away!" He snaps. "Here's my theory: They can only move when we are not looking. So as long as we keep our eyes on them, we are safe."

"What do you think happened to the people disappeared? Are they dead?" Cas asks, not blinking at all as he stares.

"I don't know, let's hope not. We'll figure that out after we get out of here first. You think you can fly us out of here?" Dean feels his eyes sore and dry quickly with too long time of not blinking.

"I still have my wings, if that's your question." Cas answers stoically. "But I'd rather not use them if possible."

"Why not?"

"Naomi and the angels might still be looking for me, in case you forget, they are not happy when I got away." Cas manages a well-maintained, stable voice. "Using any angelic power or my wings might make it very easy for them to locate me and continue the process they intended to apply on me last time."

"Alright, no fly, no mojo, then. But we gotta find a way out quick. 'Cause I can't keep on not blinking for any longer." Dean moans.

"I have my eyes on it. You can blink." Cas tells him.

Dean relaxes a little, blinking a few times to soothe the dryness in his eyes.

"Don't blink! Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink!! Blink and you're dead!" A skinny man yells at them from across the plaza, pointing a flashing device at them, dashing in their direction, followed by a ginger-haired girl.
