---

Unsteady on his foot, Dean staggers at the sudden change of the ground and chilly air. Humid outdoor air replaces the stale underground air, coming to his face.

One second he was ten feet from Cas, the next, he doesn't know where he is again.

For that blink of a second, he swears he saw Cas standing right there, at the opening of the stairs, stepping down hurriedly toward him. He wanted to call him, he wanted to laugh with joy that once again they escaped a dangerous situation, and right that moment, he felt a cold pull at the heel of his feet. And the ground spun under his feet.

He is outside -- still New York, undoubtedly, considering he can see the light from the Statue of Liberty on the Elise Island from across the water. He is at the south bay of Manhattan, then. The ground is wet with reflections glinting on the puddles, just like the after-rain road they first stepped on when Cas first flied them to 1938. So if he's lucky enough -- Dean puts a mental question mark on the assumption -- it might be the same rain, and he might still be around the same time, give or take. Fingers crossed.

The street view looks differently though. There is no more posh wealthy collector's mansion, only a much taller and much plainer-looking apartment building standing before him. Each window tight and small, tiling side by side like a beehive. Whoever lives in there, the space must be as small as single motel rooms. Dean feels bad for them.

A bright red neon sign reads "Winter Quay" hanging on the very top of the building.

There is barely any light coming out from the windows, with the majority of them closed tight and only a handful of them open. If he looks close enough, there are people sitting next to the windows, idly looking out. He has glimpses of some old people moving sluggishly behind the windows.

Not just any apartment building then, an elderly living building. Dean thinks, instantly feeling a prickle at the back of his neck. He doesn't like it, but he can't really tell why, just the usual hunter's instinct kicking in. Something about this building gives him the same feeling whenever they have to go into a haunted house -- the lingering sense of death and a creepy sense of something terribly wrong there. The places where most cases happen and people die. Talking about heebie jeebies.

He reaches for the back of his belt automatically, his fingers closing on empty air. The damned Grayle and his guards took his gun and phone, of course. Dean curses quietly, clenching his fist.

He doesn't like it -- he's all alone, weapon-less, backup-less, clueless. He doesn't know when and where he is, and there is this creepy-looking old people's house waiting for him to enter. The gate creaks open by itself as Dean looks, like an opening mouth waiting to swallow him in.

"Standard opening of a B-movie, replacing ketchup with blood. Great." He murmurs to himself, wondering if there is anywhere he can go other than stepping into the unquestionably biggest creepy house that looks like trying to invite him in.

There is fluttering sound of wings somewhere behind him. Dean turns sharply, but he can see nothing but trees jittering in the light breeze. The yellow bulbs of the street lamps are only bright enough to light up maybe twenty feet of the road around them. Something lurks in the dark shadow.

Dean turns back to the apartment building. The two angel statues standing by the gate have shifted their postures. Dean's pretty sure their hands were covering their faces before he turned, and now their hands are lowered, their faces showing. Their wings are furled close to their backs, both wearing long robes.

"More Weeping Angels." He curses, staring at both of them, not daring to blink the slightest. "Please don't tell me every single statue in Manhattan is a freaking Weeping Angel."

The dark night doesn't answer his question, only sending more movement behind his back. There is no way he'd turn around to check if it's more angel statues shaking the trees or just wind, with the two very adult-looking angels eying hungrily in his direction.

Walking inside the obvious trap seems to be the only option now.

Dean mentally calculates the route where he can walk into the gate of the building without looking away from both gatekeeper Angels. The conclusion seems to be impossible, but he bets his luck.

Dean walks toward the gate, feeling his eyes start to sore again. He blinks one eye at a time, barely wetting the dried eyes. The statues didn't move.

There is a stretch of stairs leading to the door, five steps, give or take. He has to measure the distance with the periphery of his eyes, keeping the focus remain on the statues. For the first time, he feels two eyes are not enough. He can't help wondering what Cas's "eyes in all directions" look like.

No way of keeping eyes on both angels now, Dean holds his breath and dashes into the gate, then takes a sharp turn the moment he's inside. He gasps as the gatekeeper angels stand right behind his back, face to face with fierce expressions. Their fingertips might only be an inch away from him, if he hadn't run faster than he ever did in his life.

Dean stares at their faces, and the statues remain still. "You are really some ugly sons of bitches, you know that?" He spits at the female angel statue with short curly hair. He imagines it might supposed to portrait some beautiful, fairy-tale looking, gentle, halo-and-harp style angel, and now, they are all nothing but monsters. The other male angel looks as strong and fit as Michelangelo's David, his socket deep and chasmal, his nose tall and straight. Dean has a weird feeling of familiarity but he can't quite place it.

He keeps the eye contact with both of them while backing up slowly, pulling one leaf of the door over, then the other, bolting them tight. Looking around, he spots a long loose pole lying by the doorframe. He blockades it on the door handles for good measure.

Regarding his work, Dean lets out a short relieved breath.

A man talks behind him, "It won't stop them, I tried."

Dean jumps and almost hits him in the face.

The Coffee Guy rubs his shoulder that just got punched, moaning in complaint.

"Sorry," Dean says apologetically, then recognizes him, "It's you. The Coffee Guy."

The guy raises his eyebrows, the same recognition dawns on him, a tight joy showing, "You're the one from the Central Park," then the raised tip of his lips quickly drops, "I'm sorry, if you're here, did you also get sent back by the Angels? River told me a little bit, but I got no idea..."

"No," Dean answers immediately, thinking about Cas's wings, but then the cellar, "Yes. Sorry, yes and no. It's a bit confusing."

"Rory Williams, also confused." The man holds out a hand.

"Dean Winchester." Dean shakes his hand, "Amy told me all about you."

Rory's jaw immediately tightens, "Amy is here too? Where is she? Is she safe?"

Dean holds up two hands in a soothing pose, "Calm down, she's okay -- at least last I saw her, Doctor got her."

"Doctor is here too?" Rory is visibly more relieved.

"Yeah, your whole big happy family, Amy, Doctor, River, everyone. You guys are having a family trip or something?" Dean can't help remarking.

Rory shakes his head, shifting his feet restlessly on the floor. "We were just hanging out in New York. Then everything went wrong, as usual." He looks a bit frustrated, but not irritated, as if already getting too used to being thrown into a rabbit hole of trouble.

"Things always went wrong, didn't they?" Dean seconds that in annoyance.

He looks around the place, examining the lobby they're in. It's a shabby place, bare and dusty, old already even as they're in the thirties, god knows how long the building has been built and probably no one has tended to it ever since. The typical look of a deserted place. Dean can't help wondering if those old people he caught sight of from outside by the windows, if they are ghosts or residents.

Dim street light passes into the space from a grimy clerestory window high above reach, near the ceiling. The metal plaque by the exposed elevator well shows at least seventy floors, with twenty to thirty rooms on each story.

Dean does a quick mental math and frowns deeply, "Holy, that's gonna be like two thousand people here." If the rooms are occupied.

"Why would anyone live in a place like this?" Rory asks beside him, staring at the same sign.

"Low rent?" Dean offers.

Right then, the gate rattles. The long rod he stuck on the handles is shaken loose. The door latches shudder like giants with great strength are shaking it from the outside, trying desperately to break in.

They gasp, hurrying toward the gate together, pushing with their backs to fight the door shut.

"Or the Angels force them to stay," Rory notes the obvious.

"Thanks, Sherlock," Dean grunts, pushing at one leaf of the door while Rory holds the other. "Any idea how to get out of here?"

Rory throws him an unhappy look, "I wouldn't be here if I know."

Dean squints at the new notice, "How long have you been here? You knew it wouldn't work when I blocked the door, you said you tried."

"I don't know, maybe minutes, maybe hours." Rory considers, "My watch stopped working, I have no idea."

Dean glances at his own watch. The fingers are not stopped -- they are moving, but they're moving pointlessly, they skip ahead then move back, they shiver at one point then suddenly start ticking again, then hesitate again. The watch has no idea about the time. *The time flux is scrambled.*

"Any idea what's the worst thing could happen if you get touched by one of those again?" Dean tries to prepare for the worst. Maybe they can still try to make a run, the brutal force way.

"Send you further back in time," Rory deadpans. "Why wouldn't they?"

Dean sighs, "So it's like the aeroplane chess -- get flown right back to the hangar. Friggin' Angels! The worst monster ever!"

The rattle on the door quiets for a moment, but they dare not move away.

Dean doesn't know how long he can keep holding on it. His muscles are sore. By the look on Rory's face, the man is about the same on the edge.

"Tell me about Amy," Rory says suddenly. "Tell me what she's like when you last met her."

"What, you want a heart-to-heart *now*?" Dean disbelieves.

"If the Angels break in and send me back again, that might be the last thing I'd ever heard about Amy ever again." Rory says as if it's obvious, "So yeah, I want to know as much about her as I still can. The memory would be all I ever have."

"What's the matter with you two?" Dean sighs, staring at the young man with a stubborn yet eager look in his eyes. "She said she loved you, more than anything." He tells him dutifully.

Rory's eyes brighten up like the Sun rising from the horizon. "She said that?"

"Why would I lie about things like that?" Dean's eyes study his face, even the tiniest crinkle glinting with happiness. Is it what love would do to a person?

Eyes unfocused on the dim air of the lobby, Rory says, "You know, sometimes I still can't believe how lucky I am. For a really long time, I thought she wouldn't ever love me the way I love her. Did she tell you we grew up together, and that we were always best friends?"

"Not the 'best friend' part." Dean swallows, feeling a funny twist in the gut.

"We were practically together every single day, I was always so happy to just *be* around her. But she never really looked at me that way. And you know what she said when she told people why we were just 'best friend'?" Rory pauses for a brief moment, not really waiting for an answer.

"Because she thought I wasn't into girls." Rory chuckles softly, "Because I never spared a look at any other girls."

"That's how she realized you love her." Dean guesses.

"Yeah. Like I can look at anyone other than her." Rory smiles, sinking in his memory. "Then we got engaged, then she ran away with the Doctor the night before our wedding."

"What?" Dean almost laughs, but he manages to stifle the chuckle at the last moment, "Isn't that too late for cold feet?"

"I think she was never really sure --" the gleams in Rory's eyes drop a few degrees, he stares at the dusty tiled floor, "-- or it's me that's never confident in her enough. When we travel with the Doctor, I always think one day she'd run away with him and never come back again, choosing him over me, choosing the 'Doctor life' over our normal life. I mean, why wouldn't she? The adventures and stars, killing monsters and saving the world -- that's the story of amazing Amy Pond. And silly old me? All I ever really wanted is living in a peaceful small town, with her, raising our babies, growing old slowly together. But I wasn't sure that's what she wanted too. And I was okay with it."

"But even so, you waited her for two thousand years." Dean remembers what Amy told him.

Rory nods like it's nothing.

"Why?" Dean can't help asking.

"Do you have anyone you'd do anything to protect them, save them whatever it takes?"

"I guess," Dean says, shifting his feet.

"Then you should know how it feels to leave them behind. I couldn't do that. So I stayed. I had to make sure she's safe." Rory answers easily.

"She doesn't even know." Dean says.

"It doesn't matter." Rory says with a firm voice, "To save her, I can do anything."

"Even condemn the world?" Dean doesn't know why this slips out of his tongue.

"Hopefully not," Rory thinks about it, "but if it means she's saved, then I don't know, maybe. Not like we haven't done it before."

Dean raises his eyebrows, "The 'exploding the universe' thing?"

Rory nods sheepishly, "More than once." Then adds quickly, "Sorry." As if afraid it personally offended Dean.

"Cool," Dean grins slightly, "I'm feeling so much better for jump-starting the Apocalypse, twice. And then my best friend let human-eating monsters out running around all over the world."

"We restarted the universe, though, for the record." Rory looks like compelled to add that, "No one remembers anything, history is back on track."

"And we locked the monsters back into the monsterland." Dean mirrors, "Cost me a year in that place though."

"Is that your version of 'waiting two thousand years'?" Rory detects the tone acutely.

Dean widens his eyes, a little surprised at the way he put it, but thinking it through... "Actually now that you said it," he says slowly, surprised again, this time at how accurate the analogy actually is, "Yes, it is."

"I just couldn't leave the place until I found him, but then I almost lost him again because he didn't want to be saved. If the angels didn't save him, he didn't come back to me again, I don't know what I'd do." Dean grimaces, doesn't know why he starts telling this stranger -- maybe already friend now? Since they've been sharing stories -- the things between him and Cas, but what the hell, they might die any moment anyway. Better than stew in dark and horror.

"I killed all the monsters I could hunt down to look for him, I think the whole Purgatory knew I was looking for him by the time I found him." Dean remembers the looks on those monsters' faces, the way they smirk and call him "his angel." Purgatory was pure, so pure that he couldn't even feel his cheek burn, because that was true. Cas was -- is, has been, and always will be -- his angel. *How can you love back someone love you like that? Died for you so many times? -- You save him back, whatever it takes.*

"I was an idiot," Dean laughs at himself quietly, "not seeing what it is. Or maybe I knew, all along, but never let myself see it."

Rory glances at him. "I'm glad you figured it out, mate." He says sincerely.

Dean ducks his head, "But how does that work out?" Because things are never easy and cut clean with them, aren't they? Even with that -- the new realization -- in mind, that still gotta be more trouble than he knows how to handle. There always gotta be complications and frictions, or things like ideal lives that you imagined differently. Everything standing in between -- sometimes it almost feels like the whole world stands in between them.

"It can't possibly be 'happily ever after.'" Dean says.

"We don't live in fairy tales," Rory gives him a look, "even Amy and I almost got divorced."

Dean drops his jaw. "How?" He doesn't need to deliver the whole question: I see how deep in love you two are, how can you two possibly walk away from each other? If even you two can't work it out, does that mean...?

Rory closes his eyes, refusing the pained memory, "We just... fell apart, I guess. Normal life happened, the Doctor didn't come to us for months, and we had a big fight. It happens."

"How did you fix it?" Dean stares at the middle of the dim shabby room, seeing holy fire burning around the angel in a circle. And the last look they shared before he left him there. He blinks the image away. He hopes never to see that look again.

"Oh, um, Amy almost got killed by the Daleks, and we saved each other," Rory replies evenly, "because I need her, and she needs me."

"Of course." Dean actually laughs. Of course. How can it be any other way?

Right then, the gate rattles harshly again, catching them in a moment of lax. It sways fiercely as if the strongest hurricane blows at it from the other side. The latch flies away and the door sways open.

Dean and Rory get shoved heavily away by the door leaves, thrown backward into the middle of the room.

Two Weeping Angels stand in the opened doorway.
