"I'm sorry." Amy sits down at the bottom of the stairs in the mansion's hallway, too tired, too defeated.

Cas stands next to the banister, quiet. "It's not your fault," he manages to answer.

"Did you see Rory?" The Doctor asks.

Amy shakes her head. "I was hoping you would find him."

"Is he not in the cellar?" The Doctor says. "That man said 'take you two to the babies, like the other one', I thought that other one must mean Rory."

Amy shakes her head again, then stops herself. "He must have been there," she realizes. "There are those burned matches on the floor, even before we were there. He must have been trying to use the matches to light up, and then..." she trails off.

"The babies must have got him, the same way they sent Dean." The Doctor nods miserably.

"Do you think they'll be in the same time and place?" Cas prompts.

"I don't know," the Doctor says. "Let's hope so."

"So is this what's going to happen? We just keep chasing them back in time, and they keep pulling them further back?" Amy winces.

"They're not back in time," River chimes in, walking down the stairs calmly, reading the devices on her left wrist. "I'm reading a displacement, but there is no temporal marker. They've been moved in space, not in time -- not that far from here, by the look of it."

"You got out?" The Doctor watches her, with amazement in his eyes, glittering like stars.

Amy and Cas snap at the same time, "So where are they?!"

River frowns at the screen, squinting and reading, shaking her arm to seemingly urge the device. Her right hand is held at her side.

The Doctor paces up and down the hallway impatiently. "Well? Come on, come on!"

River doesn't spare him a look. "If it were that easy, I'd get you to do it."

"But how did you get your wrist out without breaking it?" The Doctor is still looking at her with wonder, like she's the most amazing thing in the world.

River rolls her eyes. "You asked, I did. Problem?"

"You just changed the future!" The Doctor says, with such awe and appreciation in his voice.

"It's called marriage, honey. Now hush, I'm working." River turns her attention back to the device.

The Doctor sits down at the stairs, still grinning widely, looking just a little dazed, so happy, so hopeful.

"She's good, have you noticed?" he glances at Amy, then Cas. Voice and smile both proud. "Really, really good."

"Actually..." Cas starts slowly, tilting his head at River. He examines River, watching the way her right arm is carefully, stiffly held next to her body; she doesn't even use her right hand to tap on the screen, merely shaking and staring at it. He may not have much grace, but his eyes are still better than average humans, and he can see the fractures in the bones and tendons, the swell that's happening fast, but she manages to keep it all hidden inside her sleeves, acting as if it's nothing. Cas looks at her, wondering why. She reminds him so much of Dean, especially when he would say "I'm fine" when he's clearly not. Humans are always so much more complicated than he can understand.

Cas hesitates, wondering if he should point it out.

River clears her throat loudly. "Ah, whatever it is, it's within a few blocks. There's a car out front -- shall we steal it?"

The Doctor jumps to his feet, running to the door. He grabs her hand in the way.

River moans in pain, snatching it back from him, cradling her wrist closely to her chest, gasping from the pain as she recovers.

Blood drips slowly from her wounded wrist, the one that didn't escape the Angel's grip. It's swelling fast. The joint twisted.

The Doctor stops dead, staring at her hand, then her face. The shock and pain crawl back onto his face. The color is draining from his face as that hopeful look leaves his eyes. Huge pain and sorrow rush in like a wave diving onto the beach, washing out the little sand castles.

Cas swallows as he watches. He can feel it. Just from watching those humans and that Gallifreian, he's feeling so much. The emotions are overwhelming, and he can't make out names for most of them. He wonders if that's how human emotions are; he wonders if that's how Dean feels things.

"Okay, so when all these numbers go to zero, that's when we get a lock, okay? It's how we find Rory." The Doctor is taking off the wrist strap and her device from River, handing them to Amy, explaining the diagrams and numbers on the screen.

Amy fumbles with the devices, taking them over. "Got it."

River sits down on the stairs, trying not to cradle her bad wrist, not to meet the Doctor in the eyes as he walks to her. Her arm lies limply on her lap. Her face is frosty, decidedly stiffen -- not like being caught out, and especially doesn't like being vulnerable.

"Why do you lie to me?" The Doctor gentles his voice, sitting down next to her.

"When one is in love with an ageless god who insists on the face of a twelve-year-old, one does one's best to hide the damage," River says, without looking at him.

Cas blinks, looking away. He shouldn't be here, witnessing them, overhearing them. He understands personal space and intrusion now, thanks to Dean. But he also can't move away.

The words coming out of River surprise him. Up until now, they've been too busy saving the world, saving people, saving Dean; he never really has time to think about much, let alone talking with Dean about... anything that involves feelings. Dean doesn't like talking about feelings, and he understands.

But now that River's words start touching the edge of the topic, the constant question hovering in Cas's mind crawls back up, itching in his head -- the most mysterious and delicate concept in human emotion that he never really understands, the concept of love.

*When one is in love with an ageless god who insists on the face of a twelve-year-old, one does one's best to hide the damage.*

He's not ageless, and he's certainly not a god -- not now, at least. But it might not seem too different to a mortal from existing for eternity and existing for millions of years. And his angelic powers have certainly been mistaken as god, even Dean had once asked, after he was mysteriously resurrected in the Cemetery after Sam jumped into the Cage -- he looked at him from his kneeling position, he looked up with tears in his eyes, and Dean asked, "Cas, are you God?"

That is before he left him for an entire year, and lied in his face for another.

Cas grimaces at the memory. Is that why Dean always hides the damage, the pain, and the suffering? Keeping them only to himself? He was strong, Cas knows that, but not strong enough to carry everything -- the whole world -- on his shoulder. Yet, back then, the angels asked that of him, *he* asked that of him, when they were stopping the Apocalypse. He has hurt him so many times, so badly, since the moment they met, Cas realizes. No wonder Dean would not turn to him when he needs help, when he's in trouble, when he needs someone, anyone, because he was never there for him. He remembers all the time when Sam was hurt, or Bobby, or himself at the brink of death, all Dean would say is "I'm fine" and drink himself to almost alcohol intoxication.

Cas stares at the beautifully lit and decorated interior of the mansion, and all he can see are the shabby motel rooms Dean stayed in, alone in the dark, empty bottles sitting on the bedside stand. He watches him enough times when he's in the sleep like that, and he doesn't realize how much it pains him until now.

"It must hurt," the Doctor says quietly, taking her wounded wrist in his hands, handling it extremely gently and carefully.

River looks away. "Yes," she says. "The wrist is pretty bad too."

The Doctor just looks at her. And Cas sees -- feels, actually, more than sees -- it pains him. Just like the aching in his own heart now. The feeling of something quietly breaking.

The Doctor leans in, holding River's wrist closer to his lips, and kisses her hand. A bright orange colored light glows from his lips and surrounds her hand, enveloping it like a magic glow.

The regeneration energy. The one thing that the Doctor needs to live that long regenerative life -- it's his life as much as grace is angel's life, and the Doctor is using it to heal the woman he cares.

River gasps loudly. "No! No, stop that, stop that! Stop it!"

He doesn't let go of her hand until the light stops, and the swell and bloodstain around her wrist are all cleared.

"There we go." The Doctor says gently. "How's that?"

River snatches her hand back, trying her fingers. She glares at him. "Well, let's see, shall we?"

She uses that hand to slap him hard across the face.

"Aw!" The Doctor grumbles loudly.

"That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy -- nothing is gained by you being a sentimental idiot," she snaps furiously.

"It's not like I need it anymore," the Doctor defends.

"What?" River turns to him sharply. So does Amy.

"We both know the Time Lords only get twelve regenerations -- twelve chances, twelve lives. I'm running on my last, so this is it." The Doctor says easily.

Amy widens her eyes in horror.

"No!" River says harshly.

"Yes," the Doctor tries to convince her with a small smile. "So might as well make you feel better, don't you think?"

"You... biggest, dumbest fool in the world!" River stutters, springing to her feet, pointing a finger at the Doctor. "We'll figure something out, we'll fix it. But not when you're being a sentimental idiot throwing away your life like it's nothing!"

"River --" The Doctor tries.

"You're unbearable when you do that!" She snaps at him, striding to the front door, and slams out.

"River!" The Doctor calls behind her pointlessly, blinking, glancing around. He runs into Cas's eyes.

"What?" The Doctor says, defensive.

Cas doesn't answer. He's already moving toward the door, following River out.

<br>

River leans outside the door, breathing heavily. The night is getting deeper, the air chilly.

Cas approaches her carefully. "Hey," he asks quietly. "Are you okay?"

River collects herself, shrugging dismissively.

Cas studies her. "Can I ask something personal?"

She flashes him a look, nodding small.

"Why did you lie?" he asks.

River looks at him properly now. "Never let him see the damage. And never ever let him know death or loss is coming close -- he can't handle it. He'll tear the world apart, or it will tear him apart."

Cas makes a small agreeing sound. "I know someone who's also like that," he says.

"It's Dean, isn't it?" River says. Anger is eased from her face and voice.

Cas nods quietly, thinking. "He's only trying to do the right thing, because he loves you."

River huffs a laugh that surprises him. "The Doctor does not and has never loved me. I'm not lying."

Cas stares at her. "I don't understand. You love him."

River smiles bitterly. "Of course I do. But who said he loved me back? He's the Doctor. He doesn't go around falling in love with people. He's not that small or that ordinary. And I'm just fine with that."

Cas finds himself muted.

River continues, "When you love the Doctor, it's like loving the stars themselves. You don't expect a sunset to admire you back. I've always believed, whenever I happen to find myself in danger, the Doctor is not stupid enough, or sentimental enough, and he's certainly not in love enough to be there standing in it with me."

Cas blinks, the pain in her voice jabbing a place in his heart very closely. "That's not what I saw. He cared deeply for you," he tells her. "And the two of you are married, are you not?"

River huffs a laugh again. "That's very complicated. We were in the middle of saving the world, and he's about to sacrifice himself, again -- or rather, I was killing him. And I just, I couldn't let him die without knowing he's loved by so many and so much, and by no one more than me. You see, I was brought up by one reason and one reason only -- I was trained to kill him. All my life, I learn about him, know everything about him -- who else would I fall in love with? But I cannot say it's the same with him."

"How do you know?" Cas asks. "Did you ask?"

"I don't have to, I know." River answers easily. "And I'm fine with it. I live my whole life like that, I don't need him to break my heart every other day like all those other love birds out there."

"Maybe you should have asked," the Doctor chimes in calmly, emerging from behind them. "Then I'll tell you that you are wrong, that nothing should be broken, and the sunset and stars do love back. I checked."

River stares at him unbelievably, wordless.

Cas looks at them, lost in thought.

Amy waves the locating device, telling them. "We got it. They're at a place called Winter Quay. We should go."

They race down the steps before the mansion, leaving the door wide open.

"Don't you need to go back there to save us from that Grayle guy?" The Doctor suddenly remembers.

"Already did," River answers smoothly. "That's before I came downstairs and you acted like a fool."

"I didn't --" The Doctor defends automatically.

"Guys!" Amy stops their bickering in time, pulling open the door of the small car parked before the building. River moves to the driver seat, the Doctor on the other side. Cas eases into the backseat with Amy.

The car runs down the empty, dark street.

The plinth on the opposite side of the street to the mansion where the mother and child statue once stood, is now empty.

Grayle's panicking scream sounds up shortly.
