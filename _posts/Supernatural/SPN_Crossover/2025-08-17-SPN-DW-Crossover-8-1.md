*Thirty minutes ago, in Grayle's mansion.*

<br>

"What are you going to do to them?" Cas glares at Grayle, as Dean and Amy are pushed out the door. He wants nothing more than to follow, to strike them down and bring Dean to somewhere safe, bring everyone to somewhere safe. He hates the way his feet shake and he can't quite feel his grace or his wings -- he hates being weak and doing nothing but watching Dean suffer, and that is where all his thoughts center. But Grayle makes a gesture, pointing a finger at him, catching his attention.

"I'd worry about yourself first if I were you, sweetheart," Grayle says in an almost sweet voice, gesturing at the light switch his left hand is still hovering over. "And don't you move. You do anything, lights off, she dies." He shifts that index finger at River. River tries to struggle again, but her wrist is held so tightly by the Angel, there is not any chance of slipping off.

The lines around Cas's eyes are pressed tight. He glances at River, then meets the Doctor's eyes. He forces his fists lower, inch by inch.

"You, too. Put down that thing, will you? Then we can talk." Grayle points at the sonic screwdriver in the Doctor's hand. The Doctor makes a growling face, but he leaves the screwdriver on the floor.

"Happy?" he grits.

Grayle hums, pleased with himself. "I would never know you have so much more use than I thought, Detective," he says to River without looking at her.

"I assure you, whatever you're going to do, you *do not* want to piss off those two boys," River says, voice carefully controlled. "They are so much more than what they look like."

"I wouldn't worry too much," Grayle answers, grinning, turning his attention back to Cas and the Doctor, eying them like a collector regarding a pair of ancient Chinese vases from two thousand years ago in a museum. "In fact, I'm counting on that."

Cas squints at him. The Doctor follows his gaze. "What do you mean?"

Grayle doesn't answer immediately, and one of the two guards comes back right then. "Tie them up," he waves him over and gestures at them.

He makes sure his finger doesn't leave the light switch when Cas and the Doctor shoot murderous looks at him. He raises a challenging eyebrow, pointedly tilting his chin at River. Neither of them resists as they're tied up.

The guard is very thorough with ropes and chains, wrapping around their bodies, making tight knots behind them, and a second layer of iron chain locking their neck, hands, and feet to the ground -- just like how the Weeping Angel statue is chained to the alcove.

Rough metals and fibers brush against his skin through the ragged cloth, Cas gets reminded of his cuts from the flight, still fresh, some of them still bleeding. He can feel the grace flow sluggishly inside him. He barely scraped enough grace when he had to stand with Dean in that brief gun-fight moment, knowing he should at least have *something* ready in case he needed to protect him, protect all of them. Now that the moment is over, he realizes he has pulled most of the grace away from where it was trying to heal his body. His body must look even worse from the outside, but he can't really spare any thought for himself.

Grayle walks slowly closer as they are tied up and not able to move, closing in on Cas, eying his bloody wounds and cuts on the chest almost admiringly. A look of awe, but looking down, as if he's nothing more than a beautiful specimen he collected, and now he's just enjoying the view. "You're not human, aren't you?" he says with widened eyes.

Cas realizes he must be watching his leaking grace through the wounds on the vessel. Sometimes it's so easy to forget he's not human, especially when Dean is around. He doesn't treat him as if he's anything different, anything more, or anything less. He treats him like an equal, a friend. Apparently other human beings are not like him.

"You will make such a fascinating collection. I cannot wait to hear what everyone says when they see I acquired such a pure and bright creature," Grayle speaks as if he discovered a new species when traveling through some remote rainforest.

Cas can do nothing but glare at the middle-aged man taking control. He finds his mind keeps slipping to Dean, wondering how he's doing right now, where he is, whether his situation would be any better than his or worse, thinking of the danger he put all of them in by flying them here. For a split second, he's distracted, forgetting the man before him.

"I have to ask, what are you?" Grayle holds out a finger, lifting his chin up, observing his face with great interest.

Cas snaps his head hard, trying to shake his hand off. The chain rattles heavily, dragging him down, exhausting his already wounded body.

"Naughty," Grayle tuts, taking his hand back. "Very defiant. Would you rather be tied to that Angel instead?"

Cas glances at the Angel statue. The face of the chained Angel statue is so hollow and broken beyond recognition, but similar to Hannah's statue back at the fountain, for some reason, he thinks he can still sense a familiarity in it. If it's the statue of some other angel he'd known, it's not entirely impossible. But he still can't understand how it happens; it never happened before -- angels aren't usually tied to their vessels, let alone statues of their images; the Lord had demanded no image in the form of anything in the very early Ten Commandments.

Cas tries to channel some of his sense toward the statue, to feel her, to hear her. She's suffered greatly, Cas thinks, she must have been constrained by this man for a very long time, starved and tortured, until one day, she would be eroded to nothing but a pile of sand and dust, like all humans after they die, like all stars after they die.

"Do you realize she's screaming?" Cas says angrily, before he can stop himself. He doesn't know why he said that, but he doesn't stop. "They can feel pain. And others can hear it."

He can feel the Doctor and River's eyes land on him, heavier and more gingerly than before.

"Good," Grayle answers with a grin. "I was wondering about that. I don't want all my effort to go unnoticed."

"And what *effort* is that, exactly? By sending people to torture rooms? Sending them to danger, to death?" The Doctor cuts in, eyes burning with flames of fury. "Did you realize those are all good people, important people, people others care about and would do anything to save?"

Grayle's attention is captured by him. He moves to stand before him now, scrutinizing the Doctor in a similar manner to the way he treated Castiel. "And why do you care? Who are you?"

"I'm the Doctor." He looks at the human dead in the eyes, keeping his words weighted.

"Doctor who?"

"Ha!" The Doctor grins, his mood visibly getting better just from hearing that.

Grayle narrows his eyes. "You don't even have a name, why do you have so many hearts for others?"

"I only have two, hardly 'too many'," the Doctor answers casually, then his face glooms. "Though I guess compared to you, with no heart, it does seem a bit too many."

"Doctor --!" River raises her voice alarmingly suddenly, eyes on the door's direction.

The Doctor turns his head sharply, so does Cas. Even Grayle pauses and looks over their shoulders to watch. A flash of lightning sparks in the air, as if tearing open the fabric of reality, and a figure squeezes through.

And her first sentence is: "Hello, Sweetie. Again. What are you boys going to do without me?"

<br>

The Doctor stares at the newcomer: "River?"

The figure that looks exactly like their River -- who is still grasped by the Angel -- marches to the sleeky, fleshy, now mouth-gaping man, without a word, punches him in the face and knocks him down clean and quick. The beefy guard receives the same treatment from her left hook fist before he has time to react, falling onto the floor in a loud thump.

River complains, "Oh, I wanted to do that!"

The new River answers with a smile, "You get to do it in ten minutes."

The Doctor understands now. "Vortex Manipulator," then immediately, annoyedly. "You had it the whole time, and you couldn't come back earlier?"

The future River shoots him an unimpressed glare while picking up the sonic screwdriver and beaming their ropes and chains off. "You try to ride a motorbike in traffic like this! I can tear the world apart if I get one second wrong. And don't forget all the new paradoxes it could have created! I wouldn't do it if I didn't know it already happened."

The device on her left wrist blinks and beeps sharply.

She raises her arm and presses the screen stiffly with her right index finger. "I gotta go now."

"That's all? You can't give us anything else?" The Doctor shakes off the now loosened ropes around him, jumping to his feet, reaching to the future River.

"It's only ten minutes into the future, Sweetie, not too much can be done, especially when I was chained up most of the time," the future River rolls her eyes. "But you do want to hurry."

"Speaking of, can't you help sonic me free? I need my hand back," River says loudly, using her free hand to gesture at the Angel that captured her.

"Sorry," the future River turns to herself. She leans in closer, her look turning carefully controlled, voice low to almost like a whisper, "You got all the spoilers from the book. And I'm sorry, it's gonna hurt."

"See you later," she smiles at the Doctor, leaves the sonic screwdriver back where she picked it, and disappears in a quick buzzing sound and lightning sparks similar to the one when she appeared.

"What's gonna hurt?" River asks after her with a raised voice, but she's no longer there to answer.

"Am I always so annoying?" River wonders aloud.

The Doctor chuckles. "Most of the time, yes. That's a clever trick, by the way."

River hums dismissively. "I must have learned it from you. The way you escaped the Pandorica."

The Doctor grins slightly, recalling the same. "That's right."

He walks past Grayle's unconscious body to pick up the sonic screwdriver she left behind, and the book Amy dropped on the floor before she was taken away, looking at the cover thoughtfully.

"She said the spoilers are in the book," Cas says, freeing himself from the loosened ropes and chains, taking them off his neck and body, all the while looking at the same book as the Doctor does. "It must have answers to what's happening to the Angels, and how to save everyone."

"Does that include *saving the Angels*?" The Doctor asks slowly, not looking up.

Cas thinks about it briefly. "If we can, if they're still savable."

"You talk about them like they're alive. You knew they're in pain," River says acutely.

"Like it's your own kind," the Doctor continues, staring at him now.

"You said 'she'," River points out.

The Doctor narrows his eyes, "What are you, really?"

Cas blinks, glancing between them, taken aback. "I told you, I'm an Angel of the Lord."

"And you're sure you don't have any connection to the Weeping Angels?" River says cautiously.

Cas realizes. "You don't trust me."

The Doctor wiggles his eyebrows. "Don't take it personally. I don't trust most people."

River mouths quietly. "That's true."

"You don't seem to have a problem working with me when Dean is here," Cas says, a little uneasy.

"Well, he's not here to endorse you now, is he?" The Doctor notes the obvious. "There is something you didn't tell us, I doubt even he knows, and I wonder why."

"What else do you know about the Angels?" River follows the interrogation closely. "What do you know about *her*?"

Cas glances at the statue again. "She has a name," he finally says.

"What?" The Doctor is surprised.

"Hael. Her name is Hael, I believe." Cas closes his eyes briefly, meeting their eyes again. "We met in Heaven. And I can sense her from the statue. I don't know how or why, and I don't think it *is* her. But there is a connection between the statues and the angels, the fountain in Central Park is Hannah, those two outside are Mirabel and Samandriel, that's all I know. Now, can we talk about saving the humans we care about?"

The Doctor exchanges a questioning look with River.

River shrugs. "Good enough for me."

The Doctor exhales a short breath. "We don't know where they're taken to. You should have asked him before knocking him out."

River looks unregretful. "Sorry about being too eager to take down the bastard. Guess I couldn't wait."

"The book," Cas says glumly. "We have to read it now."

"We can't. It's too dangerous." The Doctor grasps it tight, as if afraid Cas would snap it from him.

"If River is to write the book, she'd make it useful, right?" Cas says thoughtfully.

"I'd certainly try," River answers easily.

"What, you want to find something spoiler-free to read? A page of handy prints? Previews?" The Doctor says skeptically.

"It doesn't matter. The spoilers are already out." Cas suddenly says. "She would know them in ten minutes whether we like it or not. So we can read anything. Pick a random page, and that will be the page we need."

"Closed time loop, I like it," River comments.

The Doctor still hesitates.

"You know he's right," River says encouragingly. "We don't have much time, Doctor. We have to find them quickly before the Angels do. Read it, let's say, Page 43, that's my lucky number. Let's see what it can give us."

The Doctor swallows, opening the book carefully, reading the lines on the page: "If my hand doesn't hurt like it's falling apart, I'd make sure he gets more than a punch. For a second, I want to murder him, but I know the Doctor would never approve. I have to restrain myself. And besides, there are more things I have to worry about now, more things that are hurting so much worse than a broken wrist, everything I wish I didn't know but the Doctor already read it -- where the Angels send them from the cellar, the sacrifices our new friends are going to make, and Amy and Rory's last farewell..."

The Doctor snaps the book shut, his chest heaving and falling violently with each breath. He glares at the cover so fiercely as if his eyes can torch it to ashes. The shock drains the blood from his face. "No! NO!!" he yells, furious and painful. "I can't believe I made this mistake."

"Calm down, Doctor," River tries vainly.

The Doctor strides to her, speaking right to her face. "This is all your fault! I shouldn't have read anything! You get your wrist out without breaking it!"

"How?"

"I don't know! Just do it! Change the future!" His voice is broken, savage and outrageous.

River is taken aback, blinks at her wrist caught at the Angel's grip.

"Come on, angel, they're in the cellar." The Doctor slams out of the room. Cas hurriedly follows.

<br>

The guard who took Dean away stands outside the cellar door. The Doctor raises his sonic screwdriver at him, but Cas is faster. He marches to the man in such fury, a powerful fist is already greeting his face. The man is caught off guard, but he's surprisingly strong enough to take the beating without collapsing. Instead, he draws the gun and shoots within a blink.

The gun shot startles both of them.

Cas lets out a low moan of pain. A fresh gunshot wound shows on his shoulder, blood gushing out. His steps stagger backward by a step, but it doesn't stop him. He hand-chops the gun off the guard's hand, grabbing his arm and pushing him backward forcefully. The guard yells in fury, throwing himself back at Cas.

The Doctor sonics him right that moment, pinning him down. Cas catches the break and gives the guy another punch on the head, which finally knocks him out.

"Amy!" The Doctor shouts at the closed door. Cas tries to pull it open by hand, but the door doesn't give.

"Amy, if you're in there, stay clear!" The Doctor waves Cas to clear the way, beaming the screwdriver at the door. The door shakes under the sonic wave, vibrating violently.

The door is blasted open, and Cas yells, "Dean!"

The two metal plates are knocked down the stairs. Flying dust of iron and wood float in the air, showing stairs leading to a dark space.

"Cas." He hears Dean's voice. Though light, he hears him. His heart leaps just from that voice.

The two of them rush down the stairs. The girl is the first to come into view. The Doctor pulls her into a hug with such joy and relief that Cas can't feel anything but happy for them. But --

"Where is Dean?"

The dark space is empty. For the blink of an eye, Cas swears he saw the face of that familiar human, but the next, as he moves two steps down, there is no one there, as if Dean's face is just a brief hallucination his brain conjured.

Cas raises his voice, "Dean!"

Amy turns around sharply, pointing behind her, "He's right here --"

The horrible truth catches up and her voice is caught in her throat. There is no one behind her, except on the ground, there is a loose bundle of a suit that Cas recognizes without doubt belongs to Dean. Two small statues of cherub tumble on the floor, not moving when they're staring, with an empty space right next to them.

There is a third missing one, one that cursed Dean and sent him away.

"Dean --" Cas stares at the space where Dean should have been, where he saw him for a blink of an eye, where he no longer stands.

His heart bleeds worse than the fresh gun wound on his shoulder.

He lost him, again.
