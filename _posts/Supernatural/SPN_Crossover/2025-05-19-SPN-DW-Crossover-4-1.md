Dean automatically follows the order, looking back at the cherubs. "I'm not blinking," he says, answering the skinny guy.

The cherub statues haven't moved an inch since they started staring at them.

The man rushes to their side, pointing the buzzing device in his hand directly at the statues. The device gives off an electronic beeping sound. Dean keeps trying to steal a glimpse at what he's doing, but doesn't dare to move his gaze away. He watches the man from the peripheral of his eyes.

There is a pitch and turn in the buzzing sound as the man moves his hand around, then an explosion sound as a final touch. The cherub statues fly backward a few feet, and shattered into pieces.

Dean assumes that should mean it is safe to stop staring now. He turns his head, pointing at whatever-it-is in the man's hand, and he says, "I want one of these."

The man waves it around like a kid showing off a new toy that only he has, and he grins, "My sonic screwdriver? Sorry, limited edition, one and only in the universe."

"What did you do to them?" Cas asks from Dean's side.

"Absorbed the temporal energy they just ate, that should starve them weak for a few minutes before their next feed. They might come back any time though." The man tilts the sparkling pen-looking thing -- sonic screwdriver, he said? -- and flashes it a few more times, frowning at it as if he's reading something from a tiny screen on its body. "Oh bad, that's bad -- I think they just absorbed energy from at least two people, maybe three."

"Who are you?" Dean snaps.

The man looks up from the screwdriver, meeting his eyes, waving a hand roughly in their direction, uttering rapidly, "Hello, I'm the Doctor, I'm a Time Lord. This is Amy, she's Scottish. We are time travelers. Any questions? No? Good. Now, where is Rory?"

Dean looks him up and down. The skinny man is about his height, his hair as ruffled as Cas's in his early days, wearing a shirt and a brown tweed jacket. Dean's gaze lands on his collar, "I gotta ask, bow tie, really?"

The Doctor widens his eyes a little, straightening his bow tie self-consciously, "Bow tie is cool."

Dean and the girl -- Amy -- chuck at the same time.

That's when Cas says, "Yes, I have questions. I thought Time Lords were extinct after the Time War; the whole of Gallifrey was wiped from existence."

Dean stares at him, "What?"

The Doctor frowns, "How--?" A pause, then he narrows his eyes, "You are not human."

Cas answers steadily, holding the gaze, "Neither are you."

Dean raises his voice slightly, "You know them?"

Cas breaks the gaze to turn his head to Dean, "They are aliens. Gallifreians, specifically. But they call themselves Time Lords -- it sounds better. They have two hearts and regeneration abilities, basically twelve lives for each one of them." He looks back at the Doctor, "Did I miss anything?"

The Doctor considers for a beat, "Sounds about right."

Dean's still staring at Cas, "Aliens. You know aliens are real and you never thought to tell me?"

Cas stares back, "You never asked."

Dean rolls his eyes, "Any other aliens? Lizard-people are real?"

Cas answers, "A lot. They're actually called Silurian, local on Earth, and Earth is not the only planet with life forms..."

Amy clears her throat, "Guys, focus! Not the time!"

Dean turns to her and says quickly, "Sorry."

Cas says the same. "Sorry."

The girl with red hair has an attractive face and a very strong commanding charisma that people might just tend to listen to her without knowing why, Dean notices. Himself included.

Amy asks demandingly, "Where is Rory?"

Dean waves his hands to gesture the height and hair, "The Coffee Guy? Yay high, nerdy hair, shirt and jacket?"

Amy thins her lips, "That's him. He was just buying us coffees --"

"-- And my sonic screwdriver caught some wild and strange temporal energy surge, so we followed the signal here --" the Doctor smoothly carries on with Amy's sentence, head tilted and carefully searching their faces.

"-- Have you seen him? Where is he now?" Amy asks worriedly.

Cas answers with a compassionate voice, the one they usually use on victims' family members, "I'm sorry, but the statues touched him --"

"-- and he just vanished." Dean finishes his sentence.

"Oh God," Amy covers her face, turning to the Doctor, her voice desperate, "where did they send him?"

The Doctor looks restless, his eyes swimming around the fountain and the empty terrace, not meeting Amy's eyes. "I don't know," he says, in a painful, regretful voice. "I'm sorry, Amy, but I don't know."

Dean studies them, "Wait, so, you know what happened to him?"

Cas says beside him, "The statues, you know what they are, don't you? You told us not to blink. What are they?"

The Doctor nods briefly, "They are not statues. They're Weeping Angels, the deadliest, most powerful, most malevolent life form evolution has ever created. The Lonely Assassins, they used to be called. No one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the universe, or very nearly. They have the most perfect defence mechanism that nature has ever evolved. They're quantum locked. They don't exist when they're being observed. The moment they're seen by any other living creature, they literally turn to stone, and you can't kill a stone. 'Course, a stone can't kill you either, but then you turn your head away. Then you blink. That's when they hit, they kill you nice and slow, no mess, no fuss -- they send you back into the past and let you live to death, the rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye. You die in the past and in the present, they consume the energy of all the days you might have had. All your stolen moments. They're creatures of the abstract; they live off *potential* energy."

Dean needs a moment to process the information. He starts with "So --", but that's as far as he gets.

"Guys! The Angel!" Amy points over his head.

Dean and Cas turn sharply. Behind them, the Angel of Water statue had moved when none of them laid their eyes on it. The probable mother statue of the four cherub statues has turned toward them, wings spreading high and wide in an attacking pose, face fierce with fangs. Her hands are claws with long nails now, frozen in the posture of reaching out to grab them.

Cas's face grimaces at the sight of it.

Dean tries not to panic, "Is it just me or does she look super pissed?"

The Doctor answers, "Maybe I shouldn't blow up her children in her face."

"What do we do, Doctor?" Amy asks in a pitched voice.

"Can't you use your sonic thing on her again?" Dean suggests to his back, not daring to move his eyes away.

The electronic buzz sounds up near their heads. Dean can see a shade of bright green flashing at the corner of his eyes.

But nothing happens to the statue.

"Ah, she's too strong for the same trick," The Doctor says, frustratedly. "The usual then, run! Run!!"

"Where?!" Dean yells.

"The Tardis!" The Doctor yells back from a small distance away. It sounds like he and Amy already started running without Dean and Cas.

"WHAT?!" Dean shouts.

"THE TARDIS!!" The Doctor is farther away, heading out of Central Park to the southeast.

Backing away with your eyes focused on a creepy statue without blinking is impossible, let alone running. Dean finds out.

He holds out an arm to keep balance, just in case there is anything on the ground behind him that might trip him over. Cas takes his hand, keeping him guided, and maybe to keep himself balanced as well.

The two of them take their steps back cautiously together, step by step.

"Now would be a really good time if you can just fly us out or use those other eyes you said you have," Dean says gloomily.

"Or you can go, I'll keep staring at her." Cas offers.

"No! Absolutely no," Dean snaps immediately without thinking, "no way I'd just leave you here. Not again. We'll get out together."

Cas falls quiet for a short moment.

They can't hear any other footsteps behind or around them. Not human's, not creepy stone angel's.

"You think those two might just run off?" Dean can't help wondering aloud. "We might just be two big idiots and the perfect baits to keep the statue thing still, so they can buy some time to get away."

"You don't trust them?" Cas asks.

"What, you do?" Dean retorts, "He's an alien with two hearts and a funny bow tie!"

"And I'm a celestial being with wings and no body," Cas says flatly.

Dean makes a choked sound, "Which side are you?"

Cas lets out a stifled chuckle, "Yours, of course."

Dean tilts his head toward Cas so much that he almost glances at his face automatically but manages to stop himself not to lose eye contact with the Angel statue.

He's not convinced, "We don't even know what that 'Tardis' thing is."

Just as he speaks, a loud metallic thrumming sound echoes from the sky. The air around them ripples like animation, turning from open outdoor space to a dimly lit indoor space with green and blue lighting.

A cheerful, melodramatic voice sounds up behind them, "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard the Tardis."
