Dean wakes up with a light moan of a headache.

The light from the sky is too bright. The stone underneath him is too cold and rigid.

He sits up, realizing he's in a graveyard, with his recent four new companions waking up slowly near him. He would have thought they are some dream too vivid with too much imagination.

Amy and Rory are hugging in relief.

"Where are we?" Dean asks.

The Doctor beams at him. "Back where we started, 2012. You collapsed the timeline, the paradox worked. And we all get thrown back where we belong."

"The angels?" Dean says, stumbling up, looking around.

There are still statues near some tombs, looking peaceful and tranquil, beautiful and solemn. Some of them are shaped like angels, others just human figures without wings.

"These are just normal statues," the Doctor follows his gaze. "I tested. Sonic-ed and blinked, they don't move. I think all the Weeping Angels -- I mean, the infected angels of the Lord -- are wiped clean."

"Does that mean cured or killed?" Dean is suddenly tense.

The Doctor falls quiet for a second. "I don't know about that. Sorry."

"And Cas?"

The Doctor shakes his head mutedly. "Didn't see him since waking up."

"No." Dean breathes heavily. "I did that specifically to save him, you can't tell me he doesn't get a second chance."

He shakes his head, refusing to accept the reality.

There is a statue standing guard at the entrance of the graveyard. The figure looks tall and stiff from the back, with wings held out in a relaxing position. He can't see it clearly enough from this distance, but there is a pull in his gut.

He squints, and he blinks.

The statue disappears from its position. Dean jumps, and some device of the Doctor's or River's starts beeping.

"Survivors!" River is alarmed. All of them shift from post-battle celebration mode to battle-ready mode.

They look around, eyes sharp.

And then Dean sees him. The final remaining Weeping Angel. His angel that was weeping. The statue moves close to him at a safe distance, close enough for him to see, but not close enough to touch. Dean doesn't think; he dashes to him, ignoring the shouting of warning of the others.

"Cas!" Dean runs until he's right in front of him.

There are fissures all over his skin -- the surface of his stony form, to be exact. His eyes are filled with tears of sorrow, and even if there is no color in the stone, Dean can still tell the blue in it. The sea of bitterness and desperation. The ocean of pain and loss.

That is the moment Dean realizes, this time, when he jumped, Cas was the one having to watch him die and not able to save him.

He swallows hard, touching his cheeks, the corners of his lips, and the marks of tears. He wants desperately to wipe those tears from his face.

"I'm sorry," Dean murmurs, pressing his forehead with Cas. "Please tell me how to save you."

"He's a survivor," the Doctor says behind him quietly. "Must be because he's in the center of that timeline explosion."

"Doesn't look like a survivor to me if he's still a statue," Dean answers, without opening his eyes, without taking his hand away from the statue.

"What should I do? Another paradox to fix him?" Dean asks desperately.

"That could rip the earth apart." The Doctor warns.

"The Earth." Dean actually laughs. "I save the Earth enough times, about time it saves us for once for a change."

He looks at Cas, then blinks deliberately.

Cas moves. His hand raises up, reaching to Dean, as if he wants to touch Dean, but he remembers what he is at the last moment, and he has to restrain himself to stay away, stay far.

Dean puts his hand on it.

"Don't!" The Doctor blurts out.

"I don't care," Dean cuts him off, already knowing what he'll hear. "If he sends me back, then we go back together. Wherever he goes, I go."

He shuts his eyes tightly, painfully, letting the tears overflow. "Cas, I don't know if you can hear me," he says, praying before he realizes that's what he's doing, "but if you are in there somewhere, come back to me, please. Because --" his voice chokes, he swallows hard. Words fail him. Instead, Dean leans, pressing his lips on the statue of Cas, letting his tears wet the stone. He tastes the salty flavor of the stone and his tears.

That is when he starts feeling Cas start stirring, softening. The head is first to come back, as it was the last to turn to the stone. His eyes blink dazedly. And Dean doesn't stop until the lips under the touch turn soft, flesh, real. Cas kisses him back with a low, quiet moan, "Dean."

He waits until the whole of Cas turns back to normal to stop. Pull apart half a step, just to study him carefully, top to bottom, just to make sure he's really alright this time. The tear marks linger on his face, and he wipes them with the back of a hand.

Dean watches with so much joy that the ability to speak escapes him.

Cas makes a small shivering move, and the wings disappear from his back.

Dean frowns, pouting, "I liked them."

Cas looks at him in the eyes, the remnant of pain and desperation swirling in his blue eyes. Dean swallows. And Cas says, too gently, too terrified, "Please don't do that again."

And Dean answers with a choked, "Same goes to you."

Cas pulls him back into a hug so warm and tight that Dean never wants to break again. Every inch of skin is so soft and gentle under his touch; he would never imagine he would miss the touch of flesh so much. He rests his chin on Cas's shoulder and leans his head against Cas's cheek, thinking this is how he'll spend eternity.

But he forces himself to pull back again. "Listen," Dean says, heart pounding fast as those dazzling blue eyes staring right back at him. "There's something I should have said, before those things happened, before anything happens again." He glances at the other people, watching Amy and Rory bumping shoulders now, the Doctor and River wiping the exterior of the Tardis together. He wets his lips. Cas waits patiently.

And Dean tells him, "I can't let you die without knowing you are loved, by so many and so much. And by no one more than me."

Cas gasps quietly, eyes widening, blinking fast.

Unsure and shaky, Cas whispers, "You love me?"

And Dean starts smiling, ever so gently. "That's what I said."

Cas breathes out, biting his lips, and then, hoarsely, honestly, "I should have let you know the same thing."

And Dean answers, "I already do."

They pull each other in again, closing the gap between their bodies and their lips -- any gap feels too wide and too empty now, neither of them can bear.

<br>

"Look who finally decides to join," River jokes as they walk back to the group. Tardis looks fresh and new, showing no sign of charred, burning marks from the explosion, even the light bulb on top of the machine spins cheerfully and brightly.

"I see someone has finally figured *something* out," Amy says, eyeing their shared grins and holding hands.

Dean blushes slightly. "Thanks to you," he says half-jokingly.

"You're welcome," Amy takes the credit gladly.

"What now?" Rory hangs around, hands in his pockets. "I'm thinking some pub."

"I want to go to the pub right now!" The Doctor answers immediately. "Are there video games? I love video games!"

"We are so gonna hang out together." Dean agrees.

"I thought that's going to be their family trip, the Ponds and the Doctors." Cas points out.

Dean pauses his step. "Is it? Well, we can always go by ourselves. I want the burger from Josie's again."

Amy laughs warmly. "You are more than welcome to join. Except, Doctor -- there's something you might want to know."

The tone in her voice freezes the smile on the Doctor's face. "What is it?"

Amy holds Rory's hand tight, and says, "Rory and I had a discussion, you know, after we almost died, or actually he really did." They exchange a nervous look. Rory says quietly, "Even if we're not dead, we could have stuck there, never able to go back home. And... my Dad is going to miss me."

"You're resigning?" The Doctor says slowly, understanding, but not easily.

"We're going home," Amy corrects him, a shaky smile. "We're not giving you up, if that's what you're thinking."

"You can still come for dinner," Rory says, a tight smile too. "And know we'll always set a seat for you at Christmas. You, too, Melody."

He reaches out a hand toward River, and River takes it. Her other hand in Amy's.

The Doctor blinks slowly, shakily, but not sad. Then, realization hits him. "We are still fulfilling the book."

"What did the book say?" Amy asks.

"Their big sacrifices," the Doctor nods at Dean and Cas, turning back to Amy. "And your farewell. I thought -- I thought..." He takes a shaky breath, starts laughing hysterically.

Amy catches on quickly, smiling too. "Don't worry, Raggedy Man," she says. "It's not a 'farewell', just a 'see you around'."

The Doctor says, beyond joy, "Let's go home."

Rory turns to Dean and Cas, "What about you?"

Dean shrugs, "Same old, just wandering around, working my job, I guess."

"You have anyone waiting for you to come home?" Rory asks seriously. "Like my Dad, he's watering plants for us."

"Not really, we don't have plants." Dean glances at Cas. "I got him, I got a car, that's about it."

Cas says slowly, "That's not true."

Dean raises his eyebrows.

Cas says quietly, "You have a brother, and possibly soon a sister-in-law, who might have a house and that's a family."

Dean swallows, turning to Rory, "What he said."

"That reminds me," Rory fumbles in his pocket, fishing out his phone and giving it back to Dean. He adds hastily, "Probably none of my business, but I think you should give your brother a call or something, not just let a stranger tell him after you're dead. He'd hate that."

Dean struggles with the words fighting on his tongue. He wants to bite them back, but in this man's honest eyes, he finds it easy to let them out. So he confesses frankly, "He'd never be truly happy when I'm alive. He'd never live the life he wanted if I'm around. Now I can't really damn myself, thanks to my angel, so staying away is probably the second best thing I can give him."

Rory glares at him, almost furiously, which is the first time since Dean met him. "You dumb thing," he snaps. "Do you really think he'd ever be truly happy again when he believes you're dead?"

Dean falls quiet.

Cas adds, "I wanted to tell you the same."

Dean nods silently, then, "Alright, we'll pay him a visit then, and a big, happy family dinner after."

Rory nods approvingly. "That's more like it."

"You really sound like a dad now," Dean can't help but comment.

River chimes in, "Technically, he *is* my Dad."

Rory chuckles slightly, moving into the Tardis. So do Amy and River.

"You want a ride?" The Doctor leans against the door of the Tardis.

Dean gives the blue phone box another once-over, knowing well enough now even though it looks nothing like a spaceship or a time machine from the outside, it's bigger on the inside. With his luck, it's probably going to be his only time riding in something like that. But --

Dean gives him a shake of the head. "My Baby is parked out of Central Park. Don't want to leave her behind."

The Doctor gives him an understandable nod, and a handshake for farewell.

"I'll probably see *you* again," he turns to Cas. "Somewhere in the universe, some time in the past or future."

Cas nods gently, "I'll look forward to that, Doctor."

The Tardis takes off shortly.

Dean takes Cas's hand, holding it naturally, as if he's done that a million times, as if he knows his hand belongs there. And he says, "I'm starving. Let's go to that amazing burger place first. I'll have large fries this time for all those pigeons. And we can call Sam after. What do you say, Angel?"

Cas smiles like the sun shines on him for the first time, like the most beautiful being is standing before him, speaking the most beautiful language. He braids their fingers, and answers, "I'd like that, very much."

They walk onto the street of Manhattan together, heading north. The warmth of the sun pours onto their face.

Dean takes a long inhale, breathing in the smell of the busiest city. Normal, ordinary people walk past them on the pedestrians, jostling their shoulders in the hustling streets.

Dean looks up at the skyscrapers and all those towering buildings around them, thinking for the first time, he might actually start to like Manhattan.
