"Don't blink!" Dean gasps, stumbling to his feet. Rory does the same, pulling himself up.

The two Angel statues are the same two standing guards at the gate earlier, holding out their hands in the pose of pushing the door open. The female one has unfurled her wings slightly; the male one, without hands cupping his face, shows side-swept fringe on his forehead. Why on earth do they look familiar? Dean scratches his head.

"Why the hell are they just biting our tails?" Dean steps backward slowly, putting some distance between them and the statues, the distance that he has seen them cross within a blink.

He barks at them, "Come on, I didn't do anything to you."

"I don't think they care," Rory draws back by his side. "What do we do?"

The elevator well is a hollow metal structure, the classic ancient design from the thirties with bare bars and cables that are not protected with sealed sides. They might be able to climb in it to the second floor, but they'd be killed easily and nastily if the lift decides to drop or the angels flap their wings. That leaves only --

"The stairs. Where are the stairs?" Dean asks frantically.

"Locked," Rory breaks his last hope. "I checked before you arrived; all the doors are locked."

Of course.

Dean has backed to the wall right next to the elevator, punching blindly at the mounted buttons.

"Come on!!" He begs the damned thing.

He stares at the Weeping Angels without a blink. The two of them cast long shadows on the floor. The street lamp outside flickers dangerously. "No, no, no --"

The elevator comes to life like a miracle, clanking down to their level, opening the barred door.

"Go! Go!!" Dean yells, fingers fumbling on the wall, eyes on the Angels, moving toward the lift blindly.

Rory dashes into the lift, holding the door for him. "I got them, come on!"

Dean takes the last two steps, jumping into the ancient-looking metal cage.

The rusty bars clink clank before him, sliding closed. The lift starts rising.

"Which floor are we going to?" Dean asks Rory.

"No idea," Rory searches the four sides in vain. There is no button or control handle inside.

A large human-sized poster at the back of the elevator gives them a jump. The Statue of Liberty in the image looks as realistic as the real thing. Too damn many statues in this city. Dean decides he would never come to New York ever again, if he manages to get out of here.

The wheezing sound of the old mechanics echoes loudly in the place, disturbing dust in the stale air.

Dean and Rory watch stories after stories rising into their view then being left behind. All have the same long, bleak look. An empty and straight corridor stretches in front of the lift on each floor, covered in thick scarlet velvet carpet. Not a single person in view.

The lift comes to a halt at a floor near fifty or sixty levels high -- they lost count when it got above thirty. The thing doesn't seem to be willing to move further up, so Dean and Rory have no choice but to walk into the corridor. The elevator clanks back down, leaving a dark, empty well in the space.

The bulbs on the ceiling give off smoky, tawny light, barely lighting the corridor.

Dean leads the way, looking left and right. The carpet muffles their footsteps; no wonder the whole place is quiet like a tomb. They don't even dare to breathe too loudly.

The doors have two-digit numbers on them showing the apartment numbers, and almost all have name tags labelled next to them: "W. Wallace", "J. Watson", "M. Wheeler", "J. Whittaker"...

Dean recognizes one from the missing people report he and Cas saw in the newspaper that morning -- this morning, this very same day's morning when he was having that awesome breakfast. God, that feels like ancient ago. At least it seems like he has found all the missing people, then, if they are all in this very building. But how on earth can they get everyone outta here, with probably a million creepy Weeping Angel statues guarding the place and the whole of Manhattan?

Dean shifts his attention to the end of the corridor. The light on the ceiling is not bright enough to shine all the way toward the end.

"Dean --" Rory calls after him.

"Give me a sec," Dean says, walking cautiously toward the shadowed end wall. An instinctive feeling growls in his brain like some answers are dying to crawl their way out, waiting for him to put the last missing piece into the puzzle. And something tells him the answer is *right there*.

The stone alcove in the wall blends in naturally with the rest of the decoration, looking exactly like a coherent part of the building -- as old and dusty as everything else is, covered by cobwebs.

Dean stands close enough to see there is an Angel statue sitting in the alcove, but not close enough to have a clear look at the face. This one looks particularly familiar, but her face is hidden in her palms. Her short, straight hair dangles down before her ears, reaching her shoulders.

Dean knows intuitively that if the stone statue has colors, they would be dark black.

"Dean!" Rory raises his voice more alarmingly, half a corridor away from him. Distantly, the elevator dings again.

"Coming!" Dean answers without turning back, keeping his eyes on the statue.

Then he blinks deliberately.

The statue shifted its pose. The Angel has lowered her hands. She looked up from her sitting position, two hollow stone eyes looking straight at Dean. The hairs dropped from her face, showing the soft lines of her lips and face.

Realization hits him like lightning.

"Tessa," Dean breathes out the Angel's name in shock.

The reaper he remembered from four years ago, the angel of death, is just another one of many real angels. All the dots are connected together now.

That's what they are, the Weeping Angels -- the real angels, confined in a stone body, restricted by some quantum lock. But they're still the angels he knew, not some new monster species like the Doctor said.

"Oh God, I'm so dumb, of course," Dean gasps, backing away from the stoned Tessa, back to where Rory stands. That's exactly why he felt like he knew them, because he really does. The gatekeeper angels down there, aren't they the ones coming for Cas when he was broken? Inias or what's-his-name? And the other one with curly hair, isn't she the Angel of Water Cas pointed to him? The one called Hannah. Must have gotten bored with Bethesda Plaza. Both of them Cas mentioned had gone to Purgatory for him and hurt by the Leviathans.

He claps on his head. "I have to tell Cas." Dean sends out a rushed prayer as he walks back down the corridor.

He is back next to Rory then, who points at two side-by-side doors with his mouth open. "Dean, look at this!"

"Watch out for that angel!" Dean tells him, then he turns.

Right on these two doors, the name tags unmistakably spell out:

"R. Williams"

and

"D. Winchester"

The elevator lets out a final ringing sound, and stops at their level.
