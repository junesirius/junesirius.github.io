"No, no, that can't be right, 'cause I'm still here, very much alive." Dean paces in the room. Rory nods eagerly beside him.

They all gather in Rory's room now, door closed. River fetched Dean and Cas. Apparently, what they have just witnessed, happened exactly the same to Rory, with Amy by his side, shaken like never before.

"Not for long, you won't," River says the cold truth, glancing at both Dean and Rory. "They'll catch you, and send you back to the very room you are in. For fifty or sixty years, you live and grow old in that room, until you die on that bed. You know it will always happen like that, because you already witnessed it yourself."

Dean swallows, focusing on the existence of Cas next to him, to wipe the image of his old self from behind his eyes. It's so much different from getting caught by an aging curse a few years back.

"Will Amy be there?" Rory prompts.

Dean jerks his head, silently asking the same.

"No," the Doctor answers, breaking their last hope.

"How do you know?" Amy asks sharply.

"Because --" the Doctor breaks off, looking down at his own hands. So sad and so defeated. For a moment, Dean thinks he may never answer again. But he summons the will to speak in the end, "Because he was so pleased to see you again."

The horrible truth smashes onto Dean's face. He can't un-see the face of that old man -- the old man he'd become in fifty, sixty years -- he can tell that unmistakable glint of joy when he caught sight of Cas. That is the same relief and joy every time he's in trouble and he realizes Cas is there for him, with him. He takes a step closer to Cas, rubbing their shoulders together. He needs that solid touch more than ever to know he's not in that dreadful fate yet.

"But Cas can time travel," Dean says, remembering. "He can travel to whenever and pick me up. Right, Cas?" He forces a cheerful voice, knowing it's not that easy before even saying it.

"I won't be able to, if the city is continuously occupied and disturbed by the angels like this, the time flux would be impossible to fly through," Cas answers miserably.

"You already saw what that first trip did to him, you're asking him to do it again?" The Doctor looks at Dean.

Dean lowers his head, knowing he's right. "It will kill him." He understands.

"Why are they all over us?" Amy asks, the same question in all their minds without an answer. "Why Rory? Why Dean? What did they do?"

"Bad luck?" River offers. "They need food, and any living human is just a food source for them."

The Doctor fills in for her. "It's like a huge energy farm for them. Displacing someone back in time creates time energy, and that's what the Angels feed on. But normally it's a one-off -- a hit and run. If they could keep hold of their victims, feed off their time energy over and over again... They'd never worry about running out of food again."

He looks up at River. "How many Angels in New York?"

River glances at the window. They can see the night sky and the neighboring skyscrapers from there. She answers, "It's like they've taken over every statue in the city."

"The Angels take Manhattan!" The Doctor sighs, defeated. "Because they can, because they've never had a food source like this one before. So many statues, so many people. In a city that never sleeps. It's a buffet."

"Or maybe not," Cas cuts in suddenly. The rest of them turn to him. He continues, "Maybe they're not to harm them, but to ask for help, to reach out for touch, because angels have an instinct to heal by touching. Or they're too lonely, so they want to keep those humans for company."

Amy stares at him, "Are we still talking about the Weeping Angels? Or the Angel of the Lord species?"

Dean jumps in. "We have a theory, they might just be the same thing." He explains quickly about the Purgatory rescue and the patterns they've been noticing, the names of the angels they recognized from the statues.

"Purgatory infection," River repeats slowly, eyeing Cas, who nods solemnly.

"We're not sure. It's a working theory." Dean patches. "An infection, a mutation, a disease, something like that."

"Then why aren't you infected? Why aren't you a statue?" The Doctor looks at Cas.

Cas thinks about it. "I'm not wounded by them. Or touched by other angels, I guess."

"Thankfully," Dean adds, curling his lips a tiny little bit.

"But you said you only came back about a week ago," Amy asks. "But we've been running into the Weeping Angels for ages. It's all over the timeline." She meets eyes with River and the Doctor, "Like that time when we were in Byzantium, that's the 51st century."

"And I ran into them in 1969, too." The Doctor supplies.

Cas tilts his head to consider. "Because of the time travel," he answers. "As soon as they exist at one point on the timeline, they spread across the whole timeline all at once. That's why you said no one knows where they come from, because they can be in all the time. Chronologically, they didn't exist until a week ago."

"Like our ground zero," Dean says.

"And ever since then, they spread across the whole time flux, infecting more statues, more angels, and running further backward and forward," River nods. "It makes sense."

"How does that help us fix the problem?" Amy asks quickly. "More importantly, how do we keep Rory safe?"

Dean raises his hand, "And me."

Outside the window, they hear a loud crashing sound in the distance. The floor shakes beneath them.

"What was that?" Rory panics.

"I don't know. But I think they're coming for you." The Doctor glances at the window. The city light shakes as the crash echoes, blinking dangerously. The forever bright night skyline of Manhattan falls dark briefly, then comes back up.

"What if we run?" Dean asks, thinking it seems to be an obvious solution. "They haven't got us yet. What if we just get the hell out of here and never get captured?"

"Then that would never happen, right?" Rory points at his own dead body on the bed, asking the group with hope in his eyes. Dean admires his courage to even look at his own dead body a second time.

"But it already happened -- it's destined to happen. You know it will come sooner or later. You can't run for your whole life." The Doctor says, in a pained voice.

"Doctor, they're right," River prompts.

"No, they aren't."

The loud thumping noise comes again outside, and it sounds getting closer. The floor shakes again. The light of the whole city shakes again.

Amy shrieks, "What is that?!"

River says quickly, "If they get out, if they die anywhere else, it creates a paradox. This is the Angel's food source -- paradox poisons the well. It could kill all of them. This place would literally unhappen."

"It would be almost impossible." The Doctor argues.

"Love the 'almost'," Dean says immediately.

The Doctor says rapidly, "But to create a paradox like that, big enough to clean up a whole city, possibly a whole world, it takes almost unimaginable power. What have we got? Come on, tell me, what?"

A short silence.

Amy reaches to grab Rory's hand, standing right next to him, holding him tightly. She looks at them, unfearful and determined. "I won't let them take him. That's what we got."

Dean quickly glances at Cas, running right into his eyes, realizing Cas is looking at him in exactly the way Amy looks at Rory. He swallows hard, wetting his dry lips. His heart pounds hard in his chest. He remembers every single word he talked with Amy and Rory earlier that night; he just hopes he can have one damn minute to talk to Cas about it.

"You'll do the same, right, Cas?" He hears his voice ask hoarsely, desperate to make it sound like a joke.

"Of course, Dean," Cas answers instantly. "I won't let them take you."

That massive crashing voice outside the window hits again. Now, not only does the floor feel like shaking, but the whole wall and building are shaking with it. It's like the damn thing is quaking the earth.

"Whatever that thing is, it sounds like it's getting closer," Rory says, clenching their hands tighter.

The Doctor looks at him, then Dean. "Even if you two managed to get out tonight, you'd have to keep running for the rest of your life. They would be chasing you forever until you die."

"That's pretty much my job description," Dean answers flatly.

"Well then, better get started." Amy lets out a breath, almost relieved, now that they sort of have a plan.

She goes to the apartment door, throws it open -- an Angel is there, Tessa is frozen in her feral attacking position. Her hands are raised high above her head, long claws extending from the ends of her fingernails. Amy stares at her without blinking, yelling back, "Husband -- run!"

Rory ducks into the opening under the statue, dashing outside.

Amy races out with him.

"River, I'm not sure this can work..." The Doctor tries again.

River fixes him with a look, "Husband -- shut up!"

The two of them sprint to the hallway.

Dean glances at Cas quickly, feeling his cheek burning at the imagined yell with a similar term. He clears his throat loudly. But Cas only yells, "Dean -- go! I got them!"

Dean ducks past the frozen angel, running to the hallway.

The dim lamp overhead shakes violently, blinking on and off. Two angels are cornering them from both sides, Inias from the direction of the elevator, Hannah from the alcove. They still have Tessa at the apartment door. The other four must have found the stairs and left the hallway. It's only the two of them against three angels with a dying lamp.

Dean stares at the statue of Inias and Hannah, and every time he shifts his gaze from one to the other, the unnoticed one moves closer in the blink.

"Cas -- we need to figure out something quick! I don't have enough eyes!" he yells.

"I do!" Cas answers.

"And we're running out of light!" Dean shouts, squinting at the light that is getting dimmer by each flash, until with a pop, it breaks completely. He can hear glass shattering from the bulb.

At the same moment when the corridor is covered in almost darkness, a new light source starts, warm and bright, steady, silvery blue, coming from Cas's direction.

Dean swirls on his heel, staring at Cas. The view catches his breath.

Cas is lighting up. Grace shines from his eyes and his body, his wings spreading from behind him. But instead of the shadow of the wings that he caught a glimpse of all those years ago when they first met, this time, they are the real wings made of light. It's not burning bright, so even if it's still slightly too bright to look at for long, he can see it without burning his eyes. The wings are directly made of light, but they also look soft, feathery even, though he's sure if he touches them, they would not feel fluffy. And the most astonishing thing is, the wings are covered by eyes. Big and small, blinking and staring, they look in all directions, guarding their back, their side, monitoring all the danger that can possibly approach them.

Dean finds his tongue caught, his throat tight. His voice is completely choked in his throat. It's beautiful beyond human language. Cas is beautiful. And for the first time in many years, more than ever, he realizes -- Cas is an angel.

"Go!" Cas opens his mouth, and even his mouth is filled with light. "I got them. Go to the stairs! I'm right behind you."

Dean blinks fast, shifting his eyes, squeezing the tears off the corner of his eyes triggered by the light and the view. The corridor is lit enough that none of the statues can move an inch. He finds the door leading to the stairs and pushes it open.

He can feel Cas move right behind him, as the light and the shadow of it move together with him.

The angels already occupy the lower stories. With a glance, he can tell there is no way they can run down those fifty or sixty floors safely, even with Cas. And no way the other four headed down.

He races up toward the rooftop.

Dean thinks he has never climbed the stairs faster than today in his entire life.

Two minutes later, he's already reaching the top floor, bursting through the door to the rooftop, and Cas follows right after.

Amy and Rory hold hand in hands near the edge of the roof, staring at something huge and tall behind them. River and the Doctor are staring at Cas.

"Holy!" River exclaims. "You really are an angel!"

Dean can't help grinning a little, too proud, chest too full. "That's the second time of the day I heard people say that about him. Isn't he amazing?"

But further down from where they can't see, the sound of stones moving through the stairs is loud and clear. Dean pushes the door closed, and the Doctor gives him a hand to shut it tight.

They back away from the door toward the edge of the rooftop. There is no way down now.

Amy and Rory are still staring at the thing over their heads behind the building with their mouths open in disbelief.

Dean has a bad feeling but he forces himself to turn around and look up. There, feral and fangs out, stands the Statue of Liberty, in an attacking pose. Only to be frozen under their gaze.

Dean lets out a harsh breath, hearing his mouth say: "Always wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty. I guess she got impatient."

And next to him, another gasp comes from Cas. He says, astounded: "That's Naomi."
