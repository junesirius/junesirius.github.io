### Locations

#### **Winter Quay**

(apartment block near Battery Park, south end, very close to Statue of Liberty by the shore)

exterior (in script): when looking up at the building from the outside: People are sitting at the windows -- not all of them, but most of them. Just sitting there, quietly looking out. A sense of such despair -- like they're trapped. The various faces -- hollow-eyed, lost, so sad, all of them quite aged. Somehow, just by looking, you can tell they will never leave this place. An old lady staring out. A small girl in a blue silk dress playing peek-a-boo hiding behind her hands.)

apartment interior (in script): A bleak, dusty, characterless apartment. Someone has lived here a very long time. Alone probably. (many items dusty and unused, the old self's breath, ancient and rasping)

(in film): in River's book when Sam Garner walks in : 22 floors, number of rooms in each floor: 0-1st (16), 2-5 (14), 6-14 (12), 15-16 (10), 17-18 (8), 19-20 (6), 21-22 (4), total to 252 rooms; in reality when Rory walks in: 7 floors, number of rooms in each floor: 0 (34), 1 (42), 2 (35), 3 (34), 4 (40), 5 (38), 6 (40), 7 (39), total to 302 rooms (but Rory's room is Floor 8)

(in my version): 77 levels tall (to be similar height as Chrysler Building), distribute alphabetically, Rory and Dean on same floor next door (Winchester and Williams are close enough), educated estimate based on last name distribution, they are in 73-75 floor. Set them in 66 floor, Hell number. has to climb 11 levels when escaping to the rooftop, takes about 2 min

### Characters

- The Doctor:
  - "I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings."
  - "Because --" Breaks off. So sad, so defeated. Maybe more defeated than we've ever seen him. He turns to look at the old man in the bed, summons the will to speak. "-- Because he was so pleased to see you again."

- Rory Arthur Williams (Rm. 802 Winter Quay)
  - ancient man lies on the bed. reaching an ancient, withered hand towards Amy. Rory 2 looking up at her, so desperately sad, so terribly old -- "Amy" -- and the lights die in his eyes. His hand slips from hers and he falls back.
  - Tombstone: In loving memory, Rory Arthur Williams, Aged 82

- Amelia Pond
  - Tombstone: And his loving wife, Amelia Williams, Aged 87

- River Song: detective, writer, book 《Melody Malone》(love Doctor and believe not loved back)
  - "She's got ice in her heart and a kiss on her lips, and a vulnerable side she keeps well hidden." -- Amy
  - "Just you wait 'til my husband gets home"
  - after reset: Doctor's wiping down his Tardis with a damp cloth (it's still a bit charred and battered.) River steps into sight next to him. She has a bucket and cloth and is helping him. The Doctor and the Mrs doing the chores.
  - reputation of Melody Malone: the detective who investigates angels
  
- Julius Grayle: crime boss, collector (powerful, wealthy, the Sydney Greenstreet of this world, aging, fleshy, corrupt, sinister)
  - "I want to know if it could feel pain."

- Sam Garner: a private-eye, Bureau of Security and Investigation private investigator (and everything you'd want him to be) (cynical, shrewd, world-weary but in such a Hollywood way) (die in Rm. 702 Winter Quay)
- the locked weeping angel at Grayle's study: scariest, damaged, scarred, emaciated, like it's starving. Its face is feral and ganged, but its mouth is stretched open in what could be a terrible scream of pain, with a length of chain holding it by the wrist and binding it to the wall. The whole thing is framed and lit as if were a beautiful exhibit. It's screaming and the others can hear it.

### Relationships

- Amy: "Husband, run!" River: "Husband, shut up!" Dean: (swallow) Sam: (amused, glimpse at Dean/Cas) Dean: (blush)

#### Doctor/River

- "How did you get your wrist out without braking it?" "You asked, I did. Problem?" "You just changed the future." "**It's called marriage**, honey. Now hush, I'm working. " (On the Doctor -- just a little dazed that she managed to do that. And under that, so happy. Maybe there's hope.) "She's good, her, have you noticed? Really, really good."
- The Doctor now crosses to River. She's sitting on the stairs, trying to not to cradle her wrist. It lies limply across her lap. She's a little stiff, a little frosty -- doesn't like being caught out, and **especially doesn't like being vulnerable**. The Doctor -- very gentle now -- sits next to her. "Why did you lie to me?" "**When one is in love with an ageless god who insists on the face of a twelve year old, one does one's best to hide the damage.**" The Doctor is gently taking River's wrist in his hands. "It must hurt. Come here." "Yes. The wrist is pretty bad too." **He just looks at her, a little pained by that. She can't quite meet his gaze -- like she's ashamed of saying that.** On the Doctor -- a decision. Now on his hand, holding River's wrist. It's glowing, like regeneration. "No! No, stop that, stop that, stop it." He grips his glowing hand round her wrist. The fierce glow envelopes her arm too -- and then snaps off. He kissed her hand. "There we go. How's that?" She glares at him. "Well let's see, shall we." And she uses that hand to slap him hard across the face. "That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy -- nothing is gained by you being a sentimental idiot." "River --" "You *embarrass* me!" "River --" And she gets up, strides to the front door, and slams out. On the Doctor -- what?
- River outside the door, collecting herself. Amy coming through the door -- approaching carefully, as you do on those occasions. A beat. "Okay, so why did you lie?" "**Never let him see the damage. And never, ever, let him see you age. He doesn't like endings.**"
- "You're the woman he loves." "No, I'm not. The Doctor does not and has never loved me. I'm not lying." "You're the woman who loves the Doctor." "Yes, I am. I've never denied it. But **whoever said he loved me back? He's the Doctor. He doesn't go around falling in love with people.** And if you think he's anything that small or that ordinary, then you haven't the first idea of what you're dealing with." "I assure you, she is the perfect bait. This woman is in danger, the Doctor will always come." "You're a moron. No, he won't." "He's probably already here." "No, he isn't. Of course, he isn't. God knows where he is now but I promise you he's doing whatever the hell he wants and not giving a damn about me. And **I'm just fine with that.** **When you love the Doctor, it's like loving the stars themselves. You don't expect a sunset to admire you back.** And if I happen to find myself in danger, let me tell you, **the Doctor is not stupid enough, or sentimental enough, and he is certainly not in love enough to find himself standing in it with me!**" "Hello, sweetie." "You are so doing those roots." "What, the roots of the sunset?" "Don't you dare." "I'll have to check with the stars themselves." "Oh, shut up." (S09E13, after S07E05)
- "What you said to Amy, there's a worse day coming for you?" "When I first met the Doctor, a long, long time ago, he knew all about me. Think about that. Impressionable young girl and suddenly, this man just drops out of the sky. And he's clever and mad and wonderful and knows every last thing about her. Imagine what that does to a girl. Trouble is it's all back-to-front. My past is his future. We're traveling in opposite directions. Every time we meet, I know him more, he knows me less. **I live for the days when I see him**, but I know that every time I do, he'll be one step further away. And the day is coming when I'll look into that man's eyes, my Doctor, and he won't have the faintest idea who I am. And I think it's going to kill me." (S06E01, before S07E05)
- "**I can't let you die without knowing you are loved, by so many and so much. And by no one more than me.**" (S06E13, before S07E05)

#### Amy/Rory + Doctor/Amy

Rory: "I always wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty. I guess she got impatient." He skips up on the low wall skirting the edge of the building, and turns to face Amy, the city glittering behind him. "You'll *die*." "Yeah, exactly. Twice in the same building on the same night. Who else could do that? This is the right thing to do. This will work. If I die now, it's a paradox, right. The paradox kills the Angels, tell me I'm wrong. Go on, please, 'cos I'm really scared." Amy: says nothing. "Oh, great! The one time you can't manage it!" Rory falters, almost falling, Amy steadies him. He's breathing hard, afraid, struggling to cope with this. He takes Amy's hand, presses against the center of his chest. "Amy... I think I'm going to need a little help here." Amy and Rory, facing each other, her hand still on his chest, his hand holding it there. "Stop it! Just stop it!" "Think it through. This will work, this will kill the Angels." "It'll kill you too." "Will it? River said this place would be erased from time, never exist. If this place never existed, what did I fall off?" "**You think you'll just come back to life?**" "**When don't I?**" "Rory --" "And anyway, what else is there? Dying of old age downstairs, never seeing you again? **Amy, please, if you love me, then trust me, and push.**" "I can't." "You have to." "Could you? **If it was me, could you do it?**" "**To save you, I could do anything.**" On Amy: a decision is reached. She takes Rory's hands, and puts his arms around her. "Prove it." "I can't take you too." "You said we'd come back to life. Money-where-your-mouth-is time." "Amy --" "Shut up. **Together. Or not at all.**" Doctor: "What the hell are you doing?" Rory and Amy don't take their eyes from each other. Amy: "Changing the future. **It's called marriage.**" A breath. And together they step from the edge, toppling over.

Doctor: "Amy!!!" Too late. Now, on Rory and Amy falling, in terrible, tragic slow motion -- still wrapped in each other's arms, turning as they fall. Pushing closer on the Doctor -- like **it's his worst ever moment**. "Amy!! Amy!!" And then -- silence. And then -- screams from below, cars swerving horns blaring. On the Doctor and River: Frozen, listening. Just goes on and on, worse and worse. Then -- a crackle of energy, energy-like lightning flashing over the face of the Statue of Liberty, and engulfing the roof. The whole building now glowing around them. The whole place shaking now, glowing fiercer and fiercer. **And the Doctor is *grinning*.**

#### Doctor/Amy

"Amy, please, just come back into the Tardis. Come along, Pond, please." Amy considers that, tears streaming. The Doctor now takes her hand. **Imploring. A direct, naked appeal.** Amy: resolved. She pulls her hand from his. On the Doctor: **it's like this action has a physical impact on him, *hurts* him.** "Raggedy man..." and she swings round to face him, her body now obscuring the Angel behind her. "Goodbye!" And she vanishes -- the Angel revealed behind her, its hand extended in the time-zapping position. "No..." The Doctor -- just shock. She's gone. Really, really gone.; River flying the Tardis. The Doctor slumped on the stairs, **lost in his darkest thoughts**. He's trying to pull himself out of them.

Melody Malone

A private detective in old town New York

New York Growled at my window. A friend once told me this was the town of a million stories.

Some nights I felt like they were all happening to me. This was one of those nights.

But what the hell -- my stocking seams were straight, my lipstick was combat ready, and I was packing cleavage that could fell an ox at twenty feet.

##### About the Author

Why not visit her website? Ah -- probably because the internet hasn't been invented yet. Sorry, Sweetie.

##### Quote

In the city that never sleeps and should never blink, mysteries are my business.

"Englishman in New York" by Sting

## Theory

### Original settings

#### Weeping Angels

- "People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff." (DW310) (Dean: "That's just so English")
- "Fascinating race, the weeping angels. The only psychopath in the universe to **kill you nicely**. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death, the rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye. You die in the past and in the present, they consume the energy of all the days you might have had. All your stolen moments. They're **creatures of the abstract, they live off *potential* energy**." (DW310) ("timey-wimey detector" Dean: I made a better hand-made EMF than that when I was ten.)
- "creatures from another world" "**The Lonely Assassins**, they used to be called. No one quite knows where they came from, but **they're as old as the universe, or very nearly**. And they have survived this long because they have the most perfect defence system ever evolved. They're quantum locked. **They don't exist when they're being observed.** The moment they're seen by any other living creature, they freeze into rock. No choice, it's a fact of their biology. In the sight of any living thing, they literally turn to stone. And you can't kill a stone. 'Course, a stone can't kill you either, but then you turn your head away. Then you blink. And, oh yes it can. (Don't take your eyes off that) That's why they cover their eyes. **They're not weeping, they can't risk looking at each other.** Their greatest asset is their greatest curse. **They can never be seen.** Loneliest creatures in the universe." "Your life could depend on this. Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They're fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away and don't blink." (DW310) (Dean to Cas: I see you only when you can't be seen.)
- A weeping angel, is **the deadliest, most powerful, most malevolent life form** evolution has ever produced. The weeping angels can only move if they're unseen. It's quantum lock. In the sight of any living creature, the angels literally **cease to exist**. They're just stone. The ultimate defence mechanism. Being a stone, until you turn your back. That which holds the image of an angel becomes itself an angel. The eyes are not the windows of the soul, they are the doors. Beware what may enter there. (DW604)

#### Paradox

- About paradox: "If Rory got out, it would create a paradox. This is the Angels' food source. The paradox poisons the well. It could kill them all. This whole place would literally *un*happen." "It would be almost impossible." "Loving the almost." "But to create a paradox like that, it takes almost unimaginable power. What have we got? Tell me, come on, what?" A silence. Then Amy reaches for Rory's hand takes it. "**I won't let them take him. That's what we've got.**" "Rory, even if you got out, you'd have to keep running for the rest of your life. They would be chasing you *forever*." "Well then. Better get started."
- After reset: "You collapsed the timeline, the paradox worked; we are pinged back where we belong." "What, in a graveyard?" "This happened the last time. Why always here?" "Does it matter? We got lucky; we could have blown New York off the planet. I can't ever take the Tardis back there, the timelines are too scrambled. I could have lost you both. Don't ever do that again." And he folds them both into the biggest hug. "What did we do? We *fixed* it, we solved the problem, --" "I was talking to myself." And kisses them both on the head.

#### Plot setting

"Displacing someone back in time, creates time energy, and that's what the Angels feed on. But normally it's a one-off -- a hit and run. If they could keep hold of their victims, feed off their time energy over and over again... This place is a farm. A battery farm. (Rounds on River) How many Angels in New York?" "It's like they've taken over every status in the city." "The *Angels* take Manhattan! Because they can, because they've never had a food source like this one. The city that never sleeps."

### Crossover settings

weeping angel is a kind of angel disease, purgatory virus, leviathan triggered

angels invading purgatory to save Cas, get infected, become mutated angels

because they exist on timeline, if they exist in one point on timeline, they exist in all points on timeline

petrify to sculpture shape with uncontrollable time travel ability and quantum-lock, can't move if stared at

spread infection by touching other angels

human get touched get zapped back in time

angels can feel pain, can laugh, can scream, others can hear

can be locked by iron handcuff

the tortured angel in Grayle's house is Hael, the mother-son statues are Mirabel and Samandriel, the Angel of Water is Hannah, the gatekeeper angels of Winter Quay are Inias and Hannah (how Dean recognize), the alcove angel inside Winter Quay that caged Dean is Tessa (also how he recognize)

why infected/weeping angel sends people back/touch them: (Cas's theory) maybe not to harm them, but asking for help, angels have instinct to heal by touch, so they're looking for touch to self-cure, or they're too lonely, so they capture these humans to keep themselves accompany; (Doctor's theory) they feed on time energy, they capture these human for food source; (Dean's theory) they're and they've always been bastards, so they're just continuing being bastards, want to feed *and* attract more angels and hunters over, so they can spread the disease and get more food; or that's the karma for them, about time they pay for being assholes all these times (which pains Cas to think any of them deserve this because he can hear the angels' screaming of pain even if they're not really alive as stones)

are statues always infected angels or are angels trapped inside statues: statues are always how these angels get cursed to look like when they are infected and drop into the timeline right when the statue is built, e.g. Naomi get infected and become Liberty and get sent and dropped on Earth in 1886

## Outline

### Ideas

Cas is infected when trying to save people (Winchesters/Ponds), self-sacrifice

Doctor/River save Dean/Cas, Dean/Cas save Amy/Rory (tag fix-it means fix Amy/Rory's ending, save them)

Doctor want to kill weeping Cas and stopped by Dean

Cas is a "good" weeping angel with them → deliberately turn off the light and/or close their eyes, and let Cas be free and move, Doctor/etc. freak out, Cas take care of other bad angels, Dean win the bet because he has faith (BAMF Cas)

Cas buy them time by using all his eyes in his true form to stare at all sculptures all at once so none of them can move again, so the sacrifice is he can't move or leave either (not a solution, so give up)

Dean has to stare at Cas too when Cas is weeping angel. Not blinking, stare save the day

~~put Amy/Rory in background but not emphasize? otherwise three pairs in focus, too many people? don't reverse Amy/Rory's glorious heartbreaking grand exit? death means something, that's the only way to make life mean something → what's written in stone is unchangeable, creating another paradox will rip the universe apart~~

Dean: "Let me get this straight. You save the universe but only save the UK part, fly across galaxy is close enough but USA is too far away? This isn't your jurisdiction or something? Pal, not I'm saying, you did a terrible job in protecting the earth, in case you didn't notice, it at least trashed twice if we didn't ..." Doctor: "All due respect, who's behind that? Also, USA almost trashed twice doesn't mean..." River: "Don't mind him, London gets trashed every Christmas, it's a Doctor and Monster thing." Dean/Cas: "You can say that again."

Dean distrust Doctor at first: "What? I'm supposed to just trust him like that? He's an alien with two hearts!" Cas: "I'm a celestial being with too many eyes and no body." Dean choked: "Which side are you?"

why angels go to Purgatory to save Cas: canon way, Naomi ordered, think Cas useful, want to brainwash him; why didn't brainwash: Cas fights and escapes, run away before they can find him, so best not to use his mojo/fly so he won't be found by the angels → but end up still use his power to save those people he cared

witty comments about how come the cheapest hotel sounds like 5-star penthouse; you can't live in anywhere too far away from any landscape in Manhattan; comments about American & English & Scottish accent

Doctor: "Don't blink, don't look them in the eyes" Dean: "What's wrong with their eyes" Amy: "Trust me, you don't want to know."

### Plot (early draft)

Dean back from Purgatory through portal, Cas back later saved by angels (remembered angel's war, concerned, not brainwashed ← important hint) (Sam with Amelia, undisturbed)

Dean&Cas find case in Manhattan: statue moving, people disappearing & sudden aging, tomb with wrong dates (death earlier than birth) → go investigate

Dean&Cas first notice Rory zapped away, run into Doctor/Amy (self-intros, Doctor/Cas discuss time flux), Doctor has River's book (mentioned Dean/Cas sacrifice+Amy/Rory farewell (keep it vague), River's broken wrist, gives specific time location), Cas fly 4 of them to 1938, too many weeping angels there, everyone in danger, Cas power limited because of all the angel/temporal energy

Dean/Amy volunteer to check Rory, Dean protect Amy & zapped away to Winter Quay, meet Rory; Dean/Rory try to find exit, surrounded by angels, back away in corridor, notice familiar angel face (<u>Tessa 201</u>, <u>*Inias 721*</u>, <u>*Samandriel 802*</u>, Ion 821, Nathaniel 823, <u>Hael 901</u>, Bartholomew 903, ~~Ingrid 908~~, Malachi 909, Theo 909, Azrael 909, Sophia 909, *Ezekiel 909*, <u>*Hannah 918*</u>, Neil 923, Ambriel 1110, ~~Ishim 1210~~, Benjamin 1210, <u>Mirabel 1210</u>, Kelvin 1215, Hozai 1219, ~~Dumah 1307~~, ~~Indra 1319~~), realize infection pattern

River break wrist (fail to change future), Doctor/River's love talk (River thought not loved back), Cas hear & cure River; Amy use Doctor's device to locate Dean/Rory, 4 of them go save, see room names, all witness old Dean die (Cas uneasy); River/Amy's love talk (Dean/Cas both hear)

weeping angel besiege attack, all escape to roof, Statue of Liberty attack, Cas show true form, stare all directions with all eyes, everyone shut eyes (Rory/Amy love talk, Dean/Cas hear), but Cas can't keep doing that, eventually can't maintain true form in this plane; Statue of Liberty almost touch Dean/Rory, Cas jump in front of him, get turned into statue too, Dean/all stare at him, Cas can't move

Liberty continue attack, all think no way out, Dean trust Cas, ask them for all faith, look away from Cas for a sec, Cas disappear, Liberty & other statues disappear, Cas move back, still statue

Doctor wants to sonic beam Cas, Dean furious, think Doctor wants to hurt/destroy him, but actually to link his time energy to call Tardis, can bring them all back to 2012; Dean ask River about paradox (River talk about how it's like to love Doctor, observable, related), get confirm if he dies now he create paradox, maybe can save Cas; a few deliberate blink scene sequence, Cas move to him, want to hug but can't, weeping/crying, Dean jump the building

timeline reset, everyone back to 2012, Doctor confirm time flux explosion kill most weeping angels, Dean worry about *most* may not include Cas, but Cas show up, actually weeping (not sculpture) because he overjoy Dean is alive but hate to see him die for him; Doctor/River bicker (book), Amy/Rory resign (farewell), Dean/Cas confession, HE

## Claim info

### Claim Summary

Canon-divergent to both SPN and DW, post-Purgatory before SPN S08E01 and closely follow plotline in DW S07E05, Dean and Cas come back to Earth after Purgatory, notice people missing and things weird in Manhattan, think it's a case, they go there investigating. They run into Doctor and Amy, find out Rory is the latest victim who gets zapped to the past, and weeping angel is the cause/monster. They fly back in time to 1938 to fix the problem and save people, only to find actually weeping angel sculptures are angels infected by Purgatory disease. The whole Manhattan in 1938 is in danger. All six of them have to find a way to fix the angels and humans and save the world together. There are a lot of sacrifices and realizations, the relationships between Doctor/River and Amy/Rory are very educational and relatable for Cas/Dean.

### Visual Element

On the roof of a very tall building, Cas is a weeping angel sculpture, his wings spread out all big and wide in a protective posture, protecting Dean Amy Rory from a very terrifying, huge, overwhelming Statue of Liberty that's threatening and attacking them. The 11th Doctor is also holding out his arms in a very similar protective gesture, trying to protect the humans they care. Amy and Rory are hugging. Dean stands on the edge of the building, ready to (or already) jumping out.

### Summary

*New York, the city of stories. Half of them are true, the other half, just haven't happened yet.*

\-\-\-

People are disappearing, statues are moving. Dean and Castiel -- fresh out of Purgatory -- walk into the heart of the mystery, thinking it's their usual run-of-the-mill case.

Until they meet a man with a funny bow tie and two hearts, who looks up from his screwdriver, and says, "Hello, I'm the Doctor, I'm a Time Lord. This is Amy, she's Scottish. Any questions? No? Good. Now, where is Rory?"

### Author's notes before the story

(first paragraph: usual appreciation for the bang and artist)

I am very attached to this story. All the main characters showed up in this story, from Supernatural and Doctor Who, are very dear and mean a lot to me. I tried so hard to knit the two stories together, to make it canon compliant to both worlds, timeline-wise, monster-wise, and story-wise, which I think I made it. And make it a fix-it, fixing the tragic, heartbroken endings and giving happy endings to everyone. It's not easy.

This story is heavily inspired by and adapted from Doctor Who's S07E05 episode with the same title; many of the scenes are heavily rewritten from the show because the original storytelling is so astonishing as it is. Many quotes as well. Anything I'm not doing right is probably my bad, and most of the brilliant settings and story ideas should be credited to the original show creators and production teams.

The music that accompanies the creation of this story is Sting's 1987 song "Englishman in New York," also used in the original show.

## Chap 1 The Dying Detective

> (trailer)(River POV, foreshadowing Dean/Rory)
>
> The trailer scene, similar to original DW trailer, but use River's image, except writing as "Detective" to avoid spoiler
>
> basically already telling the part that will happen in Chap 2-6 (part of River's book's beginning, River POV)
>
> (The Detective is actually Dean?)

Rain pours down the city, soaking the buildings and the statues in gloomy coldness. The night is deep, but the city is still awake. Lights glitter in every window and line the streets. A city that never sleeps.

Thunders roar from the distance, water streaming down the face of two statues standing across the street from a grand mansion. The statue of a woman holding the hand of a little boy. Light is extraordinarily bright in the building, seeping out from the windows to light up the stretches of the road in front of it like daytime, shining on the faces of the statues. A man stands behind the window, gazing at the night street, biting his cigar.

The Detective hurries toward the glamorous building. The black umbrella barely has a chance against the storm. A carriage passes by on the street, water puddles splashing under the horse's hoofs.

The giant door opens slowly with numerous tedious clicks of locks unbuckling, opening to a slit merely wide enough for the Detective to pass through sideways. The eyes of two guards in fine suits and hats peer through the opening, glancing at the night outside warily. The door is closed tightly immediately after.

"Detective," the man turns from the window, holding a hand toward his new guest, "Julius Grayle." He greets with a pretentious nod.

"Honor." The Detective gives a short nod as a reply, not taking his hand. "Every man and woman in New York knows your name, Mr. Grayle."

Grayle turns to the window, smoking his cigar. His reflection looks behind him on the bright window glass. "So are you, Detective. I heard you are the best investigator in Manhattan. So, will you take the case?"

"Sure. Why not?" The Detective smirks with an amused smile.

"Because you don't believe me." The man waves a hand casually, not shifting his eyes. The mother and son statues are barely visible in the downpour from across the street now. The night is even darker by each passing minute.

The guards read his gesture and bring forth a leather briefcase, opening it on the luxurious study desk. Fresh bills bundled neatly inside.

The Detective glances at the display, looking back at the reflection of the man. "For that as payment plus expenses? I'll believe any damn thing you say."

"But you don't believe that statues can move." Grayle finally takes his gaze away from the window, turning round, studying his guest's face.

The Detective says nothing.

"You're right, Detective. They can't. Of course they can't... " Grayle pauses a beat meaningfully, "... when you're looking."

The Detective just eyes him, then, "Whatever it is, I'm sure there is an explanation."

"I'm counting on that." Grayle grins with a humorless smile. "Good night, Detective. And good luck." He nods at the guards and turns back to the window. His look is troubled now, frowning at the night street outside.

The Detective picks up the cash from the desk, puts on the hat and coat, and follows one of Grayle's men out.

Across the street, light leaking from the mansion shines on the place where the statues were. Rain pours down on the empty plinth, wetting the stone.

<br>

The address written on the back of the business card Grayle left on top of the briefcase is an apartment building several blocks away, near Battery Park. Statues crowd among the trees in the park and near the building, leaving shadows like living beings under the night sky. The red neon sign on top of the building reads "Winter Quay."

The Detective walks up the steps leading to the building's entrance, and pauses midway, glancing at the flanking statues on the two sides uneasily. They are big weeping angel sculptures, wings closed on the back, hands covering the faces, water streaming down their fingers like tears.

The rain is relentless, and the air is prickling, leaving the kind of feeling that one is watched silently for each step from behind.

The building is tall, steeping among Manhattan's forest of skyscrapers. Most of the windows are open on the tall floors regardless of the drencher, some of the lower levels' too.

The Detective glances at the windows, meeting the eyes of a young girl in a blue dress. The girl stands alone by the window, wind flowing her dress and hair in all directions. She covers her face in her palms, closing her eyes, then suddenly looking out from behind her hands. Her lips mummer some words that The Detective cannot hear, a warning or just a playful "peek-a-boo" no one would ever know.

Next to her window, an old lady stares out. Her eyes are hollow, lost focus, and so, so sad just by the look of them. Next to hers, is another aged man, with the same tired, lifeless look. Then more of the same. All aged, all quiet, all defeated. The look of trapped and lost.

The Detective shifts the gaze uncomfortably, moving to walk up the remaining steps. The doors open automatically at the newcomer's approach, swinging slowly back on their own. The Detective hesitates at the threshold, eyeing the inside warily.

The street light shines into the hallway, showing a grand but deserted space. The metal sign by the empty elevator well is rusty, the letters noting the number of rooms on each floor are shallow and dusty, looking as aged as the residents peeping out from the windows.

The elevator well is old-styled, with hollow, sparse metal bars like a half-finished construction site. The Detective approaches it cautiously, one hand resting close to the back of the belt where the pistol is.

"Hello?" The Detective voices carefully, then almost startles at a sudden loud sound of clanking noise. The sound echoes in the empty space.

An ancient elevator wheezes its way down to the ground level, the metal door squeaks open.

Looking up, there is no showing who -- or what -- might have sent it down. The Detective steps into the cramped space hesitantly. The door rattles behind.

There is no button or handle to indicate which floor to go to. The elevator clanks into life, rising on its own accord.

The Detective turns around inside the elevator, startled again. The weeping angel statue that was outside the building, is now standing exactly where the human was moments ago, facing the elevator. Its face cupped in its hands, its wings spread open.

"What the hell?" The Detective gasps.

The lift rises beyond the first floor, blocking the view of the statue shortly.

<br>

The floor it stops at looks like a luxurious hotel floor, with crimson velvet carpet laid in the corridor. The lights on the ceiling flicker occasionally, as dim as candlelight. The long, bleak corridor is quiet, with doors and rooms on each side. A weeping angel statue sits at the end of the corridor inside an alcove, hands covering its face, head lowered in a humble, solemn pose.

The Detective steps down the corridor carefully, glancing at either side. Some doors are closed, some open. Behind each opened door, there is a small empty room to live in. And on each closed one, there is a number and a name tag.

The Detective checks the names on the doors, slowly, one by one, until stops dead at one closed door -- with the familiar name of his own.

The unlocked door is easily pushed open. The Detective knocks on it as he enters, "Hello, anyone home?"

The small apartment room has a narrow, dusty doorway, as bleak and ancient as the rest of the building. But with a small hint that someone has been living here, probably alone, probably has been for a very long time.

The cloth rack by the door has a hat and coat hanging on it. A tall, black gentleman's hat, and a long suit coat, exactly like the ones The Detective is wearing, though much older, decades older. He touches his own coat self-consciously, moving down the doorway with more unease with each step.

Lying on the shelf next to the coat rack, a leather briefcase. Dusty and unused. Exactly the same as the one in his grasp right now.

The Detective frowns deeply, putting down the one he's holding on the floor, opening the one in front of him. He drops it with a gasp -- the neatly bundled cash lies inside, with a handwritten card reading "Winter Quay" in fading ink on the very top.

His heart pounds fast. He reaches for his own briefcase, almost ready to dash for the door, only to be stopped by a weak sound behind him. A voice that sounds like a moan or a whimper.

The door leads to a bedroom, cramped and bleak, with only a bed in the center and barely anything else.

The Detective can't help himself from crossing into the room.

The old man lying in the bed must be in his nineties, his breath ancient and withered, like the last leaf on a winter tree.

"Who are you?" The Detective approaches the bed, curiosity and horror taking over the action.

The old man's eyes flicker open, staring at his bedside visitor with dead fish's eyes, his voice croaked for lack of use: "Run! Run! They're coming for you! They'll send you back!"

"Who's coming? Back where?" The Detective is alarmed. The light in the room and in the corridor flickers harder. There is a long stretch of dark moments between lights. A loud stomping sound pounds on the ground from a far distance.

"In time! Back in time!" the old man struggles hard, rising his upper body to clutch on The Detective's arm, gasping urgently, "I'm you! *I'm you!!*"

Then his struggle stops abruptly. His movement falls still. He closes his eyes as the last strength is drawn out. A last breath is rattled from his throat, and then there is no more.

Freaked out, The Detective glares at the body in the bed, stumbles a few steps back, and flees toward the door.

He races out of the apartment as fast as he can, only to halt abruptly as he sees the weeping angel statue that was in the alcove has left its place. The hands are lowered, the face with hollow eye sockets facing him, one hand reaching out to him like an invitation, undoubtedly trying to touch.

The Detective rushes to the opposite way. The elevator sighs a stop, the doors clattering open, and inside the lift, the weeping angel that was outside the building stands straight, hands reaching out, mouth open, showing sharp, ugly fangs.

The Detective's mouth agape, "What the --"

He stirs around, only to find the one from the alcove has moved forward, standing still halfway down the corridor. Looking back at the elevator, the other statue is outside the lift now.

The Detective desperately turns around, looking for a way out. Only then does he notice the green emergency sign over his head marking "Exit" with an arrow pointing at the door behind him. And thank god, that door says "Stairs."

He throws himself through it. The corridor light dies at the same moment.

The emergency light wakes in the stairwell, leaving weak green patches of light and shadows. The Detective lunges for the downward stairs, but shadows of two statues are already there, frozen as he stares at them. He glances upward then blinks down, those two shadows are already around the corner. The arms of the statues reaching out in an attacking pose.

The Detective races up the stairs without looking back.

<br>

He bounds up the stairs for his dear life, slamming the stairwell door the moment he reaches the rooftop, blocking it with some scattered iron bars he finds on the floor.

The rooftop is high above the ground, the light from the top of the Chrysler Building looks only a short distance away. This sleepless city has flowing lights in the skyline and on the street, but at this moment, to his horror, the whole city's light blinks. And in each brief moment of darkness, the loud crashing sound shakes the earth. The sound of something giant stomping on the ground, moving closer step by step.

WHOMP!

The city's light blinks.

WHOMP!

The building shakes.

WHOMP!

The sound comes from directly behind. The Detective turns around slowly.

The giant shadow of a massive statue falls on him. Its face over the far edge of the rooftop, its mouth wide open. A torch in her right hand.

The Detective gasps in horror and total disbelief: "You gotta be kiddin' me!"

<br>

## Chap 2 Missing In New York

> (Dean POV)(Act 1 setup)
>
> Dean back from Purgatory through portal, Cas back later saved by angels (remembered angel's war, concerned, not brainwashed ← important hint; why not: escaped) (Sam with Amelia, undisturbed) ← passing lines in chat
>
> Dean&Cas find case in Manhattan: statue moving, people disappearing & sudden aging, tomb with wrong dates (death earlier than birth) → go investigate
>
> find River's book in their motel, Cas read, find their own name/alias/mention in the story, goes to the place book says they will be

Birds chatter noisily around the tables, chirping cheerfully while fighting for the food crumbs on the ground. Apparently the chilliness of early autumn in the city is not enough to keep them quiet or away, nor is the man sitting by the table, protecting his French fries from these thieves.

Dean shoos at the birds, waving a hand aggressively, trying to keep his meal as safe as he can.

"Maybe if you feed them some, they'd just leave," Cas says from the other side of the table, not looking up from the book he's reading.

"No, then they'd just all come asking for a piece and I don't have anything left to eat!" Dean takes a large bite of the French fries in his hand, chewing as if for revenge. "Look at them, that must be how they end up all glossy and fleshy, I don't think I've ever seen pigeons in any other place rounder than them."

Cas looks up to observe the pigeons at his words, agreeing with a quiet hum. The pigeons are indeed looking very healthy and well-fed. He looks back at his book, turning a page.

"Man, I'm telling you, New York, even the pigeons are richer." Dean grins.

"I'm not sure that's true," Cas answers with a serious face. "There are poor people in this city."

Dean barks a laugh. "It's good to have you back, Cas. Speaking of, how do you feel? You know, after Purgatory puke me out, I'm still trying to find my sea legs. It's only been, what, a week?"

Cas keeps his eyes on the book, his shoulders stiffen a little, voice quieter. "I feel fine. And if you don't mind, I'd rather *not* think about the angels that have to siege the Purgatory to save me -- against my will -- and I have to, *again*, fight them off to run away. I already tried my best not to harm any more of them, but I think some of them were still hurt because of me; some were even my friends. If it's not for me, Inias and Hannah wouldn't ever be in the Purgatory. I didn't even have time to check if they survived the incursion. And there are more that didn't --"

"That's not your fault, you know that, right, Cas?" Dean lowers his voice too, glancing around, more self-aware now that they are in the middle of a sea of ordinary humans. "It's a good thing you get to run away before that Naomi bitch can do anything to you, whatever she has in mind. Let's keep it that way."

Cas gives a small nod in agreement, his shoulders slack.

"Now let me just finish my food and we'll get back to work." Dean swallows down the food, and takes another exaggeratedly huge bite of the burger, sighing with satisfaction.

Cas glances at him with a small smile.

"Miss the food and everything." Dean talks with food in his mouth, gesturing to their surroundings, "Not like Purgatory has any Michelin stars or anything."

Sunlight shines on the shade above their table, bright color glittering through the leaves. The diner's outdoor seating is already overbusy and crowded, even though it's way earlier than usual lunch hour. The street is jammed with vehicles of all kinds, cars and buses and pedestrians moving in all directions. It seems this city is just soaked with life at every possible space, at any time.

"Maybe we can come here more often if you like it so much," Cas offers. "Not only when there are cases."

"Nah, big towns aren't really our thing," Dean dismisses, stuffing down the rest of the burger, licking his fingers for the last bit of taste of fries and salt. "There is a reason we don't go to big-name places like Los Angeles or New York. The loose ends can bite."

Cas nods quietly. "I understand."

Dean wipes his mouth as he finishes, and throws the used paper napkin on the plate, "Now, where are we?"

Cas blinks. "We are in Josie's Burger near Central Park."

Dean tries to muffle the laugh and sigh that are fighting in his throat. "Yes, we are. I mean, where are we on the case?"

"Same as last night," Cas pulls out a piece of newspaper folded between the book pages, spreading it on the least oily corner of the table. The missing people notice takes half the page, and the page after that shows a photo of some local cemetery. The title reads "Death Earlier Than Birth."

"That sure is an eye-catching title, I'll give you that," Dean nods at the flourishing inky letters, turning the paper one hundred and eighty degrees so he doesn't need to read upside down. "How many missing people so far?"

"Ten until yesterday, we don't know if there are more in the past twenty-four hours," Cas answers.

"The earliest missing is a week ago." Dean checks the handwritten notes on the margin. They have managed to do some digging, but not enough to connect the dots yet.

"About the same time when I came back," Cas says what's on both their minds.

"You thinking what I'm thinking?" Dean says. Their eyes meet.

"That angels have something to do with that?" Cas frowns.

"Possible, cemetery and death stuff, could be your department. I can't see any connections between the victims. You got anything about the tombs and statues?"

"Reports said some statues move the place or pose, and the dates on some of the tombs are obviously wrong. The police found three new tombs with the missing people's names on them, but the dates of death are earlier than their dates of birth; therefore, 'Death earlier than birth'."

"People with the same names?" Dean suggests.

"Three pairs of people with the same names? Too many coincidences, don't you think?" Cas narrows his eyes.

"New York is a big city," Dean shrugs, though he doesn't buy the theory either. Since when do they have the luck that things are *just a coincidence* anyway?

"So what should we do?" Cas asks, his fingers absently fidgeting with the corner of the book. "Shall we call Sam?"

"Nah, we can handle it without him." Dean's face is unreadable for a moment. "He got what he wanted, an apple-pie life with a pretty woman, don't think I can do it again to rob him of that kind of life. He'd probably just punch me in the face if I showed up on the doorsteps of his white-fence house."

"Dean, I don't think --"

"Cas." Dean doesn't let him finish, giving him a stern look that means "drop the topic." Cas falls silent. 

"He made his choice." Dean keeps his voice cold and steady. "For once, I'm respecting that. It's just you and me now."

Cas sighs, grabs the book and is ready to stand up from the diner seat. "Alright. Where are we going next?"

"To the cemetery -- want to check out those tombs first. Maybe we can find something the police missed. Ask around the victim's family later -- routine questions." Dean stands up, straightening his FBI suit, gesturing for Cas to follow. "Only a few blocks away, we can cross Central Park. Come on."

They walk out of the diner, merging into the ocean of pedestrians on the streets.

Dean leans closer to avoid them getting separated by the crowd.

Cas tucks the book under his arm.

Dean regards his move closely when their elbows bump, looking him up and down, then landing his gaze on the book, as if he only starts to notice it now. "Where did you get that book?"

"What, this one?" Cas follows his gaze, flipping the book over to show him the cover. The title reads "Melody Malone," with a drawing of a sexy lady detective in a sheathy leather jacket, her face hidden in the shadow of a large detective hat, only showing red lips kissing a smoking gun.

"I like the cover," Dean comments with a small smile, taking the book and skimming random pages, "looks like some old-time detective novel."

"Yes, it is. It's a rather intriguing story about a private detective in old town New York." Cas confirms. "I found it in the motel drawer."

Dean turns to the back cover, reading out: "New York growled at my window. A friend once told me this was the town of a million stories.

"Some nights I felt like they were all happening to me. This was one of those nights.

"But what the hell -- my stocking seams were straight, my lipstick was combat-ready, and I was packing cleavage that could fell an ox at twenty feet."

He looks up from the blurb, amused, "Whoever wrote this, I like her. 'Packing cleavage that could fell an ox at twenty feet!' Look at that!"

Some passers-by glance at them with curious eyes, probably overhearing the last bit.

Cas lowers his voice, "Why do you read it out?"

"I don't know, why do you read it at all?" Dean thumbs the pages casually, eyes gleaming with mischief.

"I believed it to be a tour guide. I have considered that maybe it can help us know more about New York or the case. Though later it is only for the joy of reading -- It's a rather fascinating story about statues." Cas admits.

But Dean has stopped listening. He slowly straightens his back, grabbing the opened page with too much force on the knuckles. His eyes focus dead on the printed texts. His steps frozen.

Cas drags him off the street, leading them onto a smaller road quiet enough to talk.

"What is it, Dean?" Cas hurries in his most worried voice.

Dean reads out the lines he's staring at: "A handsome young man walks into the room, flashing a clearly fake FBI badge before our eyes, saying with probably his most persuasive, charming smile, 'I'm Agent Plant. This is my partner, Agent Page.'

"The man next to him in a raggedy trench coat has the bluest eyes I've ever seen, and looks like he barely survived a blast. He pulls out a similar badge from his suit, displaying it upside down.

"The first man sighs and corrects it for him, and the second man murmurs some words that are actually loud enough for us to hear: 'Is it really necessary, Dean?'

"And Dean answers with another sigh: 'Not really, 'cause I read from the book they already knew it's fake.'"

<br>

## Chap 3 Taking The Case

> (Dean POV)(Act 1 inciting incident)
>
> Dean&Cas first notice Rory zapped away, run into weeping angel first-hand for the first time

They stare at each other, eyes wide with disbelief and -- if Dean's honest with himself -- a little bit of horror.

"How's that possible?" Dean gasps and rereads the paragraph.

He reaches inside his suit pocket for the badge, which he already knew without really needing to double-check would show "Agent Plant," as well as Cas's would be "Agent Page."

"How can we possibly appear in a book that you found in a random motel drawer, that's probably been there forever?" Dean stares at Cas unbelievably, shaking his head. His fingers turn the book to the next page, just about to read what's next, when Cas suddenly grabs the book from him, slamming the pages shut.

"No, Dean! We can't read anymore." Cas clutches the book's spine hard. "I think -- I wish I'm wrong -- but I think time travel is involved here. The book might have the past that is going to be our future. We can't read early."

"But maybe it can help us save those missing people, solve the mystery?" Dean raises his eyebrows, "It might have all the answers we are looking for."

"And if we read and find you're dead?" Cas's voice turns harsh.

Dean swallows, but he doesn't back down, "Then we change it. We change the time and fate and everything all the time. Remember Titanic?"

Cas snorts a self-mockery laugh, "Exactly, and see how that turns out."

"But you fixed it." Dean pats him on the shoulder encouragingly. "I'm sure we can figure something out too this time, even if the worst comes."

Cas lowers his head, "I just don't want to make any more mistakes. Can we at least take it slowly? Maybe only read when we absolutely have to."

Dean thinks about that, then nods. "Alright, don't ever say I never listen to you. Right now, how about we stick to the plan?"

They emerge back to the busy 72nd St., heading to Central Park.

<br>

The hustle and bustle of the city is blocked out the moment they walk into the green space of Central Park. Ten minutes in, and they almost forget they are still in the middle of the most bustling cities in the world.

People are jogging, running, or walking dogs. In a plaza, a group of opera singers are rehearsing maybe some grand performances in the future. Artists set up sketch stands by the roadside, painting the view onto white paper. Tourists with heavy backpacks take photos of everything -- pinecones falling from the trees, commemorative sculptures of historical figures, cute dogs passing by, landmarks of the city. With the tree crowns covering the sky, even the highest skyscrapers of Manhattan are out of view.

Dean sniffs the air long and slow.

The air smells green and fresh.

"Do you sometimes think nothing bad can happen in places like this?" Dean can't help but ask. "It's like, places like this are too bright and happy to be intruded by dark, nasty monsters. Monsters are in caves and underground, the dark places under the bed or in closets, they'd never come to beautiful sunshine places like this."

"I certainly hope that is true." Cas nods.

They walk past the crowds, taking a short cut through the underpass in Bethesda Terrace. The fountain splashes under the bright sun, an angel statue standing on the very top. Not many people around the fountain today, only a couple of old people strolling slowly. A busker is singing some beautiful folk songs with a weathered guitar. Cas leaves a twenty-dollar bill in his opened guitar box.

"That's Hannah," Cas points at the angel statue on the fountain when they pass it. "I know her."

"What, really? A real angel?" Dean takes a second look at the statue. The female figure looks more human than any angel he came to know in the past few years, wearing a long silky robe instead of a suit. A pair of wings stretches elegantly from her shoulder blades. She looks down at people passing by the fountain with a look of compassionate tenderness.

"No harp or halo?" Dean jokes.

Cas's eyes are still on the static statue, as if he's looking at something *inside* the statue that Dean can't see. "Not her true form, but the statue, that's for Angel of Water. And water is her charge. I think I can even hear her just from the statue, maybe it's the water singing."

"And those are her children?" Dean points at the four small baby angels around the base of the fountain.

"The cherubs?" Cas shifts his attention to those chubby little statues. "No, she doesn't have any children. Those are just human imagination of what cherubs look like -- wrong as always -- they are not impotent babies wearing diapers, much like cupids."

"Yeah, I remember that naked dude two, three years ago." Dean chuckles at the memory.

"They're good arts with nice names, nonetheless." Cas tilts his head, examining them carefully.

"They have names?" Dean asks curiously.

"Of course they do. You humans have a habit of naming everything," Cas answers easily. "They are Peace, Health, Purity, and Temperance."

"Like dogs. I get it." Dean nudges him gently. "Come on, let's keep moving."

Cas follows him, but he glances back shortly again. "For some reason, I think they're alive." He frowns lightly, a little confused.

"What, like the statues are talking to you?" Dean eyes him from the side.

"More like giggling. Are you sure you can't hear anything?"

Dean listens carefully for a moment. "Nope, only the dude singing -- nice voice there." He nods at the busker. "But nothing angelic."

A man walks past them, holding three coffees in his hands, struggling to keep balance.

Cas looks back at the cherubs one more time, and he stops his steps.

"Oh come on, you have eyes on your back or something?" Dean stops too, turning around when he finds Cas didn't keep up.

"I have eyes in all directions, but not on this vessel's back," Cas answers seriously, his frown deepening. "Dean, look."

That's Cas's "there is something seriously wrong here" voice.

Dean is on guard immediately. "What is it?"

"The cherubs, they are gone."

Cas is right. The base of the fountain is bare now. The Angel of Water -- Hannah -- on top of the fountain stays standing, water spouting from the top and arching into the pool below, but the place where the four cherub statues were, it's empty now.

"Okay, weird," Dean says slowly, moving in the trained scouting gait, stepping up, trying to take a closer look at the statue.

"Wait, Dean." Cas grabs his arms before he can take another step, "Something else is wrong --"

Dean meets his eyes, suddenly nervous and alarmed by his tone. Their pupils shrink. It's so quiet he can almost hear his own breathing.

Dean whispers, "Since when did the music stop?"

They snap their heads toward the busker. The place only has a lone guitar box on the ground.

"He's gone," Cas says.

"Yeah, I can see that." Dean steps back slowly, away from the fountain, swallowing hard. "What the hell's happening?"

A distorted giggling sound echoes from behind them, together with some tiny little patters.

Dean swallows. "Please tell me I'm hallucinating, but does that sound like tiny stone babies running and laughing to you?"

Cas meets his eyes, nodding. "That's what I heard earlier."

"Hello? Did you hear anything?" A man asks behind them. Dean almost jumps.

"Jesus!" He turns around sharply, his hands reflexively pull his pistol from the belt, finger on the trigger. Dean lowers the gun when he sees the person talking. It's the same guy passing them minutes ago. His hands are still occupied with too many coffee cups.

"The giggling? Yes." Cas answers him.

The Coffee Guy is visibly relieved for a moment. "Oh great," he says, in an English accent, "I thought I was imagining things. I think something odd is happening here."

"You think?" Dean pointedly nods at the busker's guitar box. Cas checks on the angel fountain again.

"Do you know anything about it?" Cas asks without looking back, but doesn't hear any answer.

"Cas!" Dean yells with a hitched voice, dragging him backward with large steps.

The Coffee Guy has disappeared from thin air. Where he was standing, on the ground, there are the four missing cherub statues, frozen in a fumbling, crawling shape, just like some frozen frame of playful little babies having fun in their own way, looking innocent and harmless.

They back away quickly, keeping their eyes on the statues.

"Guess we find the missing cherubs, at least," Dean says dryly, breathing fast.

"Not funny, Dean," Cas says.

"Not laughing," Dean replies, pointing his gun at the stones. "Long shot, but, any chance you know what's happening here? Anything to do with angels?"

"They are not really angels; they are just statues." Cas stares at the cherubs. They remain still in his gaze. "They're not real. How can they possibly be alive?"

"I'm not sure 'alive' is the right term here." Dean glances back to check how much farther they can back away before hitting anything. "I have a theory, but I don't want to test it."

"Dean?" Cas glances quickly at Dean then looks back at the stones. The cherubs have moved in that split second when neither of them are not looking. They moved closer to them, small chubby arms reaching out like babies asking for a cradle, mouths opening, tiny fangs showing at the edge of the lips.

Dean gasps again when he looks back, dragging both of them hurriedly away, farther from the statues. "Don't look away!" He snaps. "Okay, call me crazy, but here's my theory: They can only move when we are not looking. So as long as we keep our eyes on them, we are safe."

"What do you think happened to the people disappeared? Are they dead?" Cas asks, not blinking at all as he stares.

"I don't know, let's hope not. We'll figure that out after we get out of here first. You think you can fly us out of here?" Dean feels his eyes sore and dry quickly with too long a time of not blinking.

"I still have my wings, if that's your question," Cas answers stoically. "But I'd rather not use them if possible."

"Why not?"

"Naomi and the angels might still be looking for me, in case you forget, they are not happy when I got away." Cas manages a well-maintained voice, too flat. "Using any angelic power or my wings might make it very easy for them to locate me and continue the process they intended to apply to me last time."

"Alright, no fly, no mojo, then. But we gotta find a way out quick. 'Cause I can't keep on not blinking for any longer," Dean moans.

"I have my eyes on it. You can blink," Cas tells him.

Dean relaxes a little, blinking a few times to soothe the dryness in his eyes.

"Don't blink! Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink!! Blink and you're dead!" A skinny man yells at them from across the plaza, pointing a flashing device at them, dashing in their direction, followed by a ginger-haired girl.

### Act 1

Dean automatically follows the order, looking back at the cherubs. "I'm not blinking," he says, answering the skinny guy.

The cherub statues haven't moved an inch since they started staring at them.

The man rushes to their side, pointing the buzzing device in his hand directly at the statues. The device gives off an electronic beeping sound. Dean keeps trying to steal a glimpse at what he's doing, but doesn't dare to move his gaze away. He watches the man from the peripheral of his eyes.

There is a pitch and turn in the buzzing sound as the man moves his hand around, then an explosion sound as a final touch. The cherub statues fly backward a few feet, and shattered into pieces.

Dean assumes that should mean it is safe to stop staring now. He turns his head, pointing at whatever-it-is in the man's hand, and he says, "I want one of these."

The man waves it around like a kid showing off a new toy that only he has, and he grins, "My sonic screwdriver? Sorry, limited edition, one and only in the universe."

"What did you do to them?" Cas asks from Dean's side.

"Absorbed the temporal energy they just ate, that should starve them weak for a few minutes before their next feed. They might come back any time though." The man tilts the sparkling pen-looking thing -- sonic screwdriver, he said? -- and flashes it a few more times, frowning at it as if he's reading something from a tiny screen on its body. "Oh bad, that's bad -- I think they just absorbed energy from at least two people, maybe three."

"Who are you?" Dean snaps.

The man looks up from the screwdriver, meeting his eyes, waving a hand roughly in their direction, uttering rapidly, "Hello, I'm the Doctor, I'm a Time Lord. This is Amy, she's Scottish. We are time travelers. Any questions? No? Good. Now, where is Rory?"

Dean looks him up and down. The skinny man is about his height, his hair as ruffled as Cas's in his early days, wearing a shirt and a brown tweed jacket. Dean's gaze lands on his collar, "I gotta ask, bow tie, really?"

The Doctor widens his eyes a little, straightening his bow tie self-consciously, "Bow tie is cool."

Dean and the girl -- Amy -- chuck at the same time.

That's when Cas says, "Yes, I have questions. I thought Time Lords were extinct after the Time War; the whole of Gallifrey was wiped from existence."

Dean stares at him, "What?"

The Doctor frowns, "How--?" A pause, then he narrows his eyes, "You are not human."

Cas answers steadily, holding the gaze, "Neither are you."

Dean raises his voice slightly, "You know them?"

Cas breaks the gaze to turn his head to Dean, "They are aliens. Gallifreians, specifically. But they call themselves Time Lords -- it sounds better. They have two hearts and regeneration abilities, basically twelve lives for each one of them." He looks back at the Doctor, "Did I miss anything?"

The Doctor considers for a beat, "Sounds about right."

Dean's still staring at Cas, "Aliens. You know aliens are real and you never thought to tell me?"

Cas stares back, "You never asked."

Dean rolls his eyes, "Any other aliens? Lizard-people are real?"

Cas answers, "A lot. They're actually called Silurian, local on Earth, and Earth is not the only planet with life forms..."

Amy clears her throat, "Guys, focus! Not the time!"

Dean turns to her and says quickly, "Sorry."

Cas says the same. "Sorry."

The girl with red hair has an attractive face and a very strong commanding charisma that people might just tend to listen to her without knowing why, Dean notices. Himself included.

Amy asks demandingly, "Where is Rory?"

Dean waves his hands to gesture the height and hair, "The Coffee Guy? Yay high, nerdy hair, shirt and jacket?"

Amy thins her lips, "That's him. He was just buying us coffees --"

"-- And my sonic screwdriver caught some wild and strange temporal energy surge, so we followed the signal here --" the Doctor smoothly carries on with Amy's sentence, head tilted and carefully searching their faces.

"-- Have you seen him? Where is he now?" Amy asks worriedly.

Cas answers with a compassionate voice, the one they usually use on victims' family members, "I'm sorry, but the statues touched him --"

"-- and he just vanished." Dean finishes his sentence.

"Oh God," Amy covers her face, turning to the Doctor, her voice desperate, "where did they send him?"

The Doctor looks restless, his eyes swimming around the fountain and the empty terrace, not meeting Amy's eyes. "I don't know," he says, in a painful, regretful voice. "I'm sorry, Amy, but I don't know."

Dean studies them, "Wait, so, you know what happened to him?"

Cas says beside him, "The statues, you know what they are, don't you? You told us not to blink. What are they?"

The Doctor nods briefly, "They are not statues. They're Weeping Angels, the deadliest, most powerful, most malevolent life form evolution has ever created. The Lonely Assassins, they used to be called. No one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the universe, or very nearly. They have the most perfect defence mechanism that nature has ever evolved. They're quantum locked. They don't exist when they're being observed. The moment they're seen by any other living creature, they literally turn to stone, and you can't kill a stone. 'Course, a stone can't kill you either, but then you turn your head away. Then you blink. That's when they hit, they kill you nice and slow, no mess, no fuss -- they send you back into the past and let you live to death, the rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye. You die in the past and in the present, they consume the energy of all the days you might have had. All your stolen moments. They're creatures of the abstract; they live off *potential* energy."

Dean needs a moment to process the information. He starts with "So --", but that's as far as he gets.

"Guys! The Angel!" Amy points over his head.

Dean and Cas turn sharply. Behind them, the Angel of Water statue had moved when none of them laid their eyes on it. The probable mother statue of the four cherub statues has turned toward them, wings spreading high and wide in an attacking pose, face fierce with fangs. Her hands are claws with long nails now, frozen in the posture of reaching out to grab them.

Cas's face grimaces at the sight of it.

Dean tries not to panic, "Is it just me or does she look super pissed?"

The Doctor answers, "Maybe I shouldn't blow up her children in her face."

"What do we do, Doctor?" Amy asks in a pitched voice.

"Can't you use your sonic thing on her again?" Dean suggests to his back, not daring to move his eyes away.

The electronic buzz sounds up near their heads. Dean can see a shade of bright green flashing at the corner of his eyes.

But nothing happens to the statue.

"Ah, she's too strong for the same trick," The Doctor says, frustratedly. "The usual then, run! Run!!"

"Where?!" Dean yells.

"The Tardis!" The Doctor yells back from a small distance away. It sounds like he and Amy already started running without Dean and Cas.

"WHAT?!" Dean shouts.

"THE TARDIS!!" The Doctor is farther away, heading out of Central Park to the southeast.

Backing away with your eyes focused on a creepy statue without blinking is impossible, let alone running. Dean finds out.

He holds out an arm to keep balance, just in case there is anything on the ground behind him that might trip him over. Cas takes his hand, keeping him guided, and maybe to keep himself balanced as well.

The two of them take their steps back cautiously together, step by step.

"Now would be a really good time if you can just fly us out or use those other eyes you said you have," Dean says gloomily.

"Or you can go, I'll keep staring at her." Cas offers.

"No! Absolutely no," Dean snaps immediately without thinking, "no way I'd just leave you here. Not again. We'll get out together."

Cas falls quiet for a short moment.

They can't hear any other footsteps behind or around them. Not human's, not creepy stone angel's.

"You think those two might just run off?" Dean can't help wondering aloud. "We might just be two big idiots and the perfect baits to keep the statue thing still, so they can buy some time to get away."

"You don't trust them?" Cas asks.

"What, you do?" Dean retorts, "He's an alien with two hearts and a funny bow tie!"

"And I'm a celestial being with wings and no body," Cas says flatly.

Dean makes a choked sound, "Which side are you?"

Cas lets out a stifled chuckle, "Yours, of course."

Dean tilts his head toward Cas so much that he almost glances at his face automatically but manages to stop himself not to lose eye contact with the Angel statue.

He's not convinced, "We don't even know what that 'Tardis' thing is."

Just as he speaks, a loud metallic thrumming sound echoes from the sky. The air around them ripples like animation, turning from open outdoor space to a dimly lit indoor space with green and blue lighting.

A cheerful, melodramatic voice sounds up behind them, "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard the Tardis."

<br>

### Act 2

Cas lets go of Dean's hand.

They look around.

The Doctor busies himself around a central structure that Dean's pretty sure is where all the engines and control units are -- if any of the sci-fi movies have any truth in them. A huge, bright pumping pillar with glass spheres vibrates up and down, making a loud whirring sound -- that's the sound they heard when the whole thing just materialized around them.

Dean watches the structure moving, walking slowly toward the console table and the guy running around it. "Do all your toys have to make funny noises?"

Amy can't hold back a small laughing sound from the other side of the table.

The Doctor rolls his eyes at Dean, offended, "This is Tardis! Of course she has to make this beautiful sound! What do you know about 'Time and Relative Dimension in Space'?"

Dean stutters, "Ugh, come again?"

The Doctor smirks, "Like I thought. If you don't know anything about her, don't make rude comments! She might be upset."

"She might be upset if you keep the brake on when landing. That's where the noise comes from." Cas follows Dean up the steps around the hexagon-shaped console table, pointing at a handle on its face. "Type Forty model's common problem."

The Doctor narrows his eyes at Cas a second time on the same day. He unleashes the handle to the opposite direction, and the noise quiets just like Cas said. "What are you?" The Doctor asks cautiously, "I don't think I've ever met your kind before."

"I'm an Angel of the Lord," Cas answers potently.

Dean adds, "He's with me." He squares his shoulders, feeling oddly proud.

The Doctor eyes both of them carefully, as if only now does he properly register them. "Relative to the Weeping Angels?" He asks, probing.

"I don't think so," Cas answers frankly. "I've only known them for the first time today."

"But you know a lot of things, you know about the Time Lords and Tardis," the Doctor purses his lips. "I don't like it."

Cas lowers his head a little, "That was unexpected knowledge to me as well, back when I was the God. Long story."

Amy whispers to Dean, "Don't mind him. He's just jealous, he doesn't like *not* being the smartest man in the room."

Dean grins, putting a hand on Cas's shoulder. "Alright, you two, enough peacock time. What are we all doing in here? Thanks for not leaving us behind, by the way, I wasn't sure about that."

The Doctor rolls his eyes again, "Of course I wouldn't do that, what do you take me for?"

Dean shrugs.

Amy answers on the Doctor's behalf, "You said the angels sent Rory back, and we think the cherubs don't have enough power to send him too far, so we might still have a chance to find him and save him -- good thing that Tardis is a time machine. So we only need to find out exactly when and where, and Doctor thinks he can trace back the temporal signal, but it takes some time to calculate."

She gestures to the console panel where the sonic screwdriver is plugged in, an old-time display screen on top of it showing some running patterns, presumably working like a computer.

Dean looks at the screen for a few moments, realizing he can't read a thing -- they're not even in English, the patterns with circles and lines are as beautiful as stars and planets but give no clue. He tilts his head and whispers to Cas, "It's like watching Sammy do the research, all the nerdy science stuff."

Cas hums softly, a fond smile showing at the mention.

Dean claps his hands, "Alright, what do we do while waiting then? You gonna give us a tour around the ship or what? Tell me you have booze here." He moves away from the console, curiously sneaking a peek at the spiral staircase on the other side of the room leading upward.

The Doctor snorts, "That is so American."

Dean rolls his eyes, "What, you drink tea instead?"

Amy cuts in, "You think it's a ship?"

Dean looks around the spherical space they're in -- which has a ton of round decorations on the curved walls and the ceiling as if they're inside a huge sphere at least three floors tall, he wonders if anyone on the Bethesda Terrace would have noticed this probably enormous alien-looking spaceship from outside, but he decides if their alien techniques are as advanced as the rest of it look like, they're probably invisible.

Dean nods at their surrounding to make a point and looks back at Amy, "A spaceship, yeah? What else can it be?"

Amy winks with a mysterious smile, "It's a time machine. It can go to all the time and all the places in the universe."

"A time-travel spaceship. A timceship!" Dean announces the newly invented nickname proudly.

The Tardis makes a low gnarling sound right then, among the constant wheezing.

"She doesn't like it, don't ever say that again!" The Doctor says without looking away from the view-screen.

"That can't be true. Wait, can she really hear me?" Dean turns to Cas in confusion. But even Cas has a mischief curve on the tip of his lips.

Dean glares at Cas unbelievably, "Not you too."

The curve widens slightly on Cas's lips, and he says, "Well, I speak all languages in the universe, including that of Tardis."

Dean finds it impossible to tell if he's serious or joking.

Amy pets the console desk like it's a delicate living thing, fingers stroking along the blinking buttons and sliders and connecting cables, says fondly, "She's a good girl, and she's *Tardis*. Don't think there is any word in the universe cooler than that."

Dean pretends a defeated sigh, turning back to Amy, "You remind me of someone. She's like a sister to me. Also red hair. I think you'd like her if you stick around longer. Now, drink?"

Amy smiles small, giving him an appreciative nod, stepping toward one of the roundels on the wall. She presses on some of them, as if looking for a correct password combination to open something. "Sorry, River, I think there's some stash somewhere --"

The Doctor looks up at her, confused, "What do you mean? There's nothing there --"

That's when a hidden cabinet opens, showing a secret stash of delicate bottles of liqueurs.

The Doctor is speechless for a second, then outrageous, "When did -- It's *my* Tardis! You can't just make random adjustments like that -- ahh, River!!"

Dean admires the collection, grinning, "Now we are talking." All the top-shelf fine collections, nothing he'd spot in places they'd usually go -- in fact, now that he thinks about that, given that they're on some alien's spaceship, these might not even be from Earth, and considering the time travel, they are most certainly not from current time, which means the drinks could have ages and ages to brew properly.

He pours himself a glass, appreciating the flavor, "Whoever this River dude is, he certainly has taste."

"*She* --" Amy emphasizes, "is my daughter."

Dean is taken aback a little, mentally measuring Amy's age, trying to do the math. "Is she even of the age?"

"And my wife." The Doctor adds weight to the bomb drop.

Dean stares at him, then looks back and forth between the Doctor and Amy. "Wait, that means you two are --"

"Mother-in-law, I know." Amy's face drops unhappily for some reason, "Time travel thing, it's a long story. Two thousand years long, actually, not sure I want to talk about it, especially when Rory is not here."

The Doctor's face glooms at the same moment, he starts randomly flipping a few switches up and down.

"Time travel is never easy, isn't it?" Cas suddenly comments. He's been watching them quietly for some time. "Always so many regrets in the past you'd want to change, but you just couldn't save everyone, and you can't change the fixed points even if you can travel back in time."

The Doctor gives him a deep look. "Indeed," he says with a low voice. The word is simple, but his tone is fractured.

Their eyes meet, both as aged as the length of the universe itself. There is a moment of understanding.

Dean watches them, suddenly realizes with more clarity than ever -- that Cas is old, really old, as old as the Earth and Sun and the beginning of all the Time and Universe. And here he is, standing in the room, wearing a trench coat, walking and talking. That Doctor has probably seen just as much time and universe to have eyes as sad and deep. He swallows. He's just a human.

Dean takes a gulp of the drink. The liqueur smooths down his throat, but it's still dry.

"You lost someone, didn't you?" he asks quietly. The question slips out of his tongue without permission.

The Doctor shoots him a pained look. "I'm hoping not anymore," he says simply, his eyes lingering on Amy's back for a moment too long.

The four of them fall quiet for a brief moment, only hearing the tiny tinkling sound from the Tardis. And then it beeps loudly, with a red flashing sign shining on the screen. The ceiling is rounded by a circle of red light shortly after.

They jump to their feet toward the console.

"That doesn't look good." Dean comments. Whatever it is, a red flashing thing is never a good thing.

The Doctor looks closely. Cas stands next to him, reading the same screen.

"What does it say?" Amy urges, "Did it find Rory?"

"April the third, 1938, old-town New York." Cas reads the message, frowning.

Dean claps his hands, "Good, we have the time and location, let's go. What are we waiting for?"

The Doctor unplugs the sonic screwdriver from the control panel, beaming its head toward the screen. The familiar metallic whirring sound echoes again, the floor bumping like an airplane in heavy turbulence. Then the red warning alarm screams louder, and the floor they're standing on starts shaking violently in all directions. The lighting inside the whole space blinks on and off as the floor wobbles, turning to a dark crimson red color. The color of blood and danger.

Amy and Dean have to grab the closest handrail to steady themselves. The Doctor and Cas lean on the console desk.

The Doctor yells over the loud emergency alarm. "She doesn't let us land! It's like a storm blizzard out there. Hang on!"

Cas puts both his hands on the metal handle he pointed out earlier -- the brake, apparently. The quaking eases for a few seconds, but almost immediately turns into a sideward spinning. All of them fall to the floor, swinging toward one side of the wall then the other; the handle is let loose, shifting up and down rapidly on its own.

The Doctor stretches his arm to reach for a hammer from underneath the console, striking the surface. "This usually works!" he shouts at the frantic central control unit, "Come on, you sexy thing! You can do it!"

"You are making it worse!" Cas yells back.

The console makes an extremely loud explosion sound, followed by a strong burning smell and dark smoke bursting from the fried panel. The brake handle flies to the ceiling and lands on the floor in two pieces.

The whirring sound slows down, but the spinning wall gets worse. They can do nothing but grasp whatever they hold on to for their dear lives.

Dean clutches the handrail with whitened knuckles, thinking how bad this idea is to board an alien ship. He doesn't even like to take airplanes, so why does he ever enter a time-travel spaceship that doesn't even have a seatbelt?

Amy falls not far from him, clinging to the same handrail as he does. In the first bout of spinning and crashing, Amy slipped right near his side. So Dean has enough distractions trying to give the lady a soft landing to not completely freak out.

And then the floor comes to rest. So are the vibrating spherical things in the center of the control pillar, which -- if a spaceship works the same way as a car -- probably means the engine has died when the brake blew off. The room is filled with smoke.

"Out! Out!!" The Doctor dashes to the door, pulling it wide, urging all of them out. In his hand, there is a fire extinguisher.

Dean and Amy rush out of the door. Cas follows closely after them. The Doctor yells at the control: "Extractor fans on!!" The loud noise of fans rumbles to life on his command.

"What the hell was that?" Dean demands, stumbling out, coughing violently because of the smoke, catching himself on the knees. Cas hurries toward him, whispering to ask if he's hurt, and Dean waves him off because he's fine.

"1938, we just bounced off it." The Doctor pokes his head out of a blue phone box, white foam and dark smoke flying in and out of the open door.

Dean straightens up when he finally catches his breath.

They are in the middle of a graveyard, with countless tombs and stones lying around them. Statues of angels and decorative figures stand at the border of the yard, in the stance of mourning and protecting. New York's modern skyscrapers can be seen over the horizon.

"Where are we?" Amy asks.

"Still in New York," the Doctor raises a finger in the air, feeling the wind, then puts the finger in his tongue, tasting the air. "Not-1938."

<br>

"You have a time machine, and it goes anywhere but 1938? How does that work?" Dean asks sharply.

"I don't know! Something is wrong with that time, I think probably too many Weeping Angels there, the time flux is all scrambled." The Doctor finishes with the fire extinguisher, changing to use his sonic screwdriver, beaming at the blue box the same way he pointed at the cherub statues earlier.

"And what's the deal with that blue box?" Dean peeks through the door, finding the inside is just the same spacious control room he was in moments ago. He walks around it, staring at the letters "Police Box" on top of the door. The inside is the time-traveling spaceship he fancied, but the outside just looks like a very English-looking police phone box from 50s, which can barely fit two grown men. Dean can't say he's not disappointed. "It's smaller on the outside."

The Doctor rolls his eyes. "That's a first, people usually say 'bigger on the inside'."

"Same thing," Dean mumbles.

"It's a disguise. I like it, I keep it, problem?" the Doctor cocks his head in challenge.

"Or it might be a malfunction in the Camouflage Unit and Cloaking Device. Have you considered replacing the chameleon circuit that has broken down?" Cas suggests kindly.

Dean wiggles his brows, "How about that?"

The Doctor stares them down. "Shut up," he says, turning back to the Tardis.

He fondles the charred paint on its exterior, his touch gentle and loving. He presses his forehead on the doorframe. Dean can hear him murmur quietly: "I'm so sorry, Dear. Take your time, rest up. We'll find another way."

Dean raises one eyebrow, amused.

Cas whispers in Dean's ear: "I think Tardis is like his Impala."

Dean turns to him sharply, "I'm not like that --"

Cas gives him a pointed look.

Dean stutters, his cheeks heated. "Shut up."

He turns to look at what the other two are doing now, wondering what to do next.

"What you said about the time flux," Dean asks slowly. "What's that? How do we fix it?"

Cas explains to him, "Time is fluid. I told you that before, that's why we can bend it on occasions."

"I didn't realize that means literally actual *fluid*." Dean feels like he's the slowest kid in the school and he doesn't like it. "Thought it's more of a metaphor, like, 'as time passes by like a river flowing' kind of thing."

"No, no, nothing like a river." The Doctor chimes in. "Humans can only understand things in such strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff."

Dean raises his eyebrows. "That is just so English," he cackles.

The Doctor disappears inside the blue box, and reappears with a clumsy, odd-looking, circuit-wrapped scavenger device that looks like it's built from a bunch of sixties household items and kitchen utensils. A little bigger than his palms.

They watch him pull out two antennas and wave the device around, reading some display on it that only he can understand.

"Doctor, what's that?" Amy asks.

"My timey-wimey detector," he concentrates on the reading, turning from one direction to another. "The Tardis navigation system is busted. I need something to tell me when and where we are. It goes 'ding' when it detects stuff."

"I made a better hand-made EMF than that when I was ten," Dean tells Cas in a low murmur.

"I made it three hundred years ago when I got trapped in 1969," the Doctor says loudly. Dean's not sure he heard his last comment. "by Weeping Angels too, that time. Not very fun."

"Sound like you got trapped by Angels a lot, Doctor," Amy remarks.

"They are nasty creatures," the Doctor wrinkles his nose like he smells something disgusting. "I hate things attacking you from your back when you are not looking." He says one word at a time, slowly, "I, hate, Angels."

Cas shifts uncomfortably by Dean's side.

Dean glances at him, talking in a low voice, "He doesn't mean you."

"I know," Cas answers. But still, his gaze drops to his feet.

The device in the Doctor's hand makes a "ding" sound.

"So, looks like we are still in 2012, back where we started," he tells them.

"A long way from 1938," Amy paces up and down the field in the graveyard, worry radiating into the air. "There must be a way to go there; we can't just leave Rory there. Doctor? Come on, come up with some brilliant ideas, like you usually do."

The Doctor runs a hand through his hair, mumbling, "I have two, but one of them requires a Vortex Manipulator, which I don't have, because I left it to River after the Pandorica, which leaves only one. But I really, really don't like it."

The three of them wait for him to spill out, but the Doctor hesitates.

Amy snaps, "What is it?"

The Doctor looks at her sheepishly, "We can let the Angels touch us and send us back."

"Would that work?" Amy asks, unafraid.

"I don't know. They might send us to different times; I might never find you or Rory again. That's what I'm afraid of," the Doctor says in a pained voice.

"But that's our only chance of finding Rory, right?" Amy glances around, already looking for the nearest Weeping Angel statue she can use.

"Amy --" the Doctor pleads quietly.

Cas chimes in suddenly, "There is another way."

"Cas, no --" Dean knows what's in his mind immediately, holding out a hand trying to stop Cas.

Cas steps toward Amy, "I can fly us there." Dean closes his eyes.

The Doctor studies him, "Why didn't you say so earlier?"

Dean answers for him, "Because it might kill him."

"It doesn't matter." Cas keeps his eyes on Amy, ignoring Dean's gaze on his back.

"'Course it does!" Dean snaps, "Cas, dammit! You said Naomi could find you and do whatever horrible things she has in mind for you!"

"Or maybe not. If we're quick enough, go there and back in a blink, she might never notice." Cas retorts, holding out a stubborn hand toward Amy. "I can help."

Amy glances between Cas and Dean, then smiles at Cas, "You really are an angel, aren't you?"

Cas smiles back, "I try to be."

Dean sighs loudly, standing closer to Cas. "I'll go too. One more person, should find him quicker."

The Doctor steps into the small circle they formed around Cas as well, following what the other two are doing, putting his palm on the hand Cas holds out.

He winks at the group, "Well then -- Geronimo!"

### draft notes

unused witty comments:

about Tardis: Cas: "it says 'Pull to open', why do you push?"

on the Tardis console: buttons, handles, sliders, keyboards, displays, trumpet, glass floor, power cables, electrical lines; all sorts of toys. not really keyboards, old-style typewriter. Dean can't help touching them, Doctor: "Don't touch anything" Dean looks disappointed, taking his hand back. But Cas sees he still tries to press on the button closest to him, it blinks blue a few times, but does nothing else. Dean looks like a happy kid with a new toy.

about flying Tardis: River: "Use the stabilizer" Doctor: "There is no stabilizer." River: "It's the blue thing, what do you think it does?" Doctor: "I don't know, it's just blue." he tries, it stabilize: "Now it's just boring. It's blue boring-er."

## Chap 5 The Gargoyle

>
> 4 of them arrive 1938, too many weeping angels there, everyone in danger, Cas power limited because of all the angel/temporal energy
>
> all confront Julius Grayle, meet River, cross introductions

It's not the first time Dean gets flied around in a wing-trip, but this is certainly the top five most unpleasant journeys. He doesn't remember the other times being so rocky and nauseous. Even worse than the crash landing in the Tardis the very same afternoon earlier.

The color and lights are muffled into a big kaleidoscope around him, spinning at a speed higher than his eyes and brain can possibly process. He really should have closed his eyes.

When his feet touch the ground in the rattled sound of wings fluttering, Dean stumbles to the ground on all fours, vomiting his breakfast burger and fries out.

"Cas, that's hell of a fly." He wipes his mouth, looking around.

The night is dark. The road has wet puddles from recent rain. The oil lamps by the road dimly light the street, showing vintage cars parked in front of a glamorous mansion, statues standing across the street from it. The air smells of damp cigar smoke and classy perfume, covering a lingering smell of horse. The sense of the thirties is permeating the air.

The Doctor and Amy are scrambling up from the ground just like him, recovering from an inelegant landing. The Doctor points his sonic screwdriver in all directions, making that small buzzing sound again, looks like trying to get a reading on the thin air.

"Where is Cas?" Dean sweeps around their landing point, then notices a small movement on the side of a parked car. He catches a glimpse of tan color and rushes there.

Cas slumps against the side of the car, eyes closed, panting heavily. His face is pale, his chest heaving and falling. Scratches of cuttings and bleeding marks all over his bare skin and clothes, more bloody wounds under the torn shirt and pants, misty light faintly glimmering in a few of the deep cuts. A smear of blood at the corner of his mouth.

Dean is instantly reminded of the last time Cas was severely weakened by a flight he had to lie down for a whole week; that other time to the Wild West wasn't easy, either. He kicks himself mentally for forgetting how much it always seems to exhaust him.

He shakes Cas on the shoulder gently, trying not to let the worry leak everywhere in his voice, "Hey man, how you holding up?"

Cas opens his eyes with a moan, eyes dazed for a moment before focusing on Dean's face. "Been better," he says, wiping his mouth, only to smudge the blood stain worse.

"Is it Naomi?" Dean asks, using his own cuff to help Cas clean up.

Cas shakes his head slightly. "It's the time flux itself. It's so... chaotic." He looks for a word to describe, then lands on -- "Scrambled. Too many Weeping Angels, we are not safe." Just like the Doctor guessed before.

Amy comes over too. "How's he doing?"

The Doctor says behind them, before Dean can answer, "Imagine when Tardis crashed, it's like trying to land a plane in a blizzard, and now? He's like a bird going through that same storm, no helmet, no seatbelt, and carrying three passengers!" His voice sounds impressed. "Welcome to 1938."

"And he did it," Amy murmurs quietly, kneeling down next to Cas, looking at his face closely. "You did it, you brought us all here. Thank you!" She says it wholeheartedly, then turns to Dean, "He'll be okay, right?"

"He's tough," Dean says, waving a hand at her, "Why don't you and Doctor go ahead looking for your man? I'll help him catch a breath first. He'd need enough strength for the trip home."

Amy nods appreciatedly, moving to check with the Doctor.

Cas's eyes follow their movement.

"Can you heal?" Dean asks with concern.

Cas frowns at himself with concentration, the way he would focus whenever he puts a finger on Dean's forehead and heals him. Dean watches his open wounds closely. They are not healed.

Cas shakes his head frustratedly. "I'm interfered," he says glumly, "Whatever is happening in the city, it's affecting my power, too. I can try harder but it might exhaust me more than healing me."

Only the slow, natural healing then. Like a human. Dean watches him, worried.

Cas holds an arm on the wet ground, making an effort to stand up. Dean reaches for his other arm, helping him to his feet.

Cas wobbles a little, but he manages to stand straight.

Dean smoothens out his trench coat and fixes his tie. The tears and cuttings don't look half as bad this way.

"It's too dangerous out here," Cas's voice croaks, tone warning. "They can be anywhere, any statues." He nods at the other side of the street, Dean follows his sight, noticing the two statues standing in the light lit from the mansion, the statues of a mother and a son. The remnants of the rain dripping on their faces, it's almost like their eyes are gleaming, staring intensely at the house.

"He's right, too much temporal disturbance, I can't get a good reading," the Doctor says, swinging the sonic screwdriver a few times like trying vainly to fix a used-up ink pen. "If the Angels are in this city, we're sitting ducks out here. Let's go inside first."

"You good to walk, man?" Dean asks under his breath, still holding Cas up like supporting an old man to cross street.

Cas answers him, "I'm not fragile, Dean."

Dean doesn't move his hands away until they reach the building.

<br>

The giant, beautiful, classic-looking architecture in front of them is the biggest, most likely the richest house they can see around the place, and best of all, the brightest, with the most light -- where they can for sure see the Weeping Angels coming if they dare try.

Amy knocks at the door.

It takes long minutes for the guards to open at least half a dozen locks behind the door by the sound of them, and it's pushed open with only enough of a slit to show the guards' eyes. "Mr. Grayle does not expect more guests tonight."

"Tell him we are with the guests he already had," the Doctor answers smoothly.

The guards mutter quietly between themselves, probably waiting for a confirmation from a higher authority.

They wait impatiently for a few minutes, and Dean can't help himself. "Oh come on, it's taking too freaking long."

He moves to the door, pulling out his badge, "FBI inspection, open the door."

The guards back away from behind the door hesitantly, open it wider for them to enter, and relock each one of them quickly.

"Mr. Grayle is on the second floor with the Detective," the guards inform them.

They don't really need the guide to know where to find the owner of the place. The study on the second floor is dazzlingly bright, as if the man has spent half his fortune on collecting all the brightest light sources in the world to put together, keeping the place as bright as daytime. Massive chandeliers hang on the ceiling, wall sconces lining together with the oil paintings, spotlights shining with a great variety of ancient chinaware, and lamps and bulbs practically taking over every corner of the room.

They follow the ancient spiral stairs to the second floor and march into the study. A fleshy, boastful-looking man in a fancy suit stands in front of the desk, with an arresting woman near a corner alcove by the wall.

Dean walks into the room, flashing his FBI badge at the people in the room, announcing, "I'm Agent Plant. This is my partner, Agent Page."

He turns his head slightly at Cas, giving him a meaningful glance. Cas pulls out his badge like Dean did with a straight face -- the badge is displayed upside down.

Dean lets out a quiet sigh, correcting it for him. Cas murmurs, "Is it really necessary, Dean?"

And Dean looks down at his own badge, putting it away with another sigh. "Not really," he says, resigned, "'cause I read from the book they already knew it's fake."

The woman looks at them with a small amused mockery, "That certainly looks fake to me."

Her eyes shift quickly toward the Doctor and Amy behind them, the grin turning into a wild smile, "Hello, Sweetie." Her eyes sparkle with joy at the reunion. "Took you long enough."

The Doctor tilts his head slightly, meeting her with a similar smile. "Sorry, didn't know you're here too, hon -- traffic was hell."

"How did you get here then?" The woman raises her left arm, showing a dark colored device on her wrist. While her right wrist -- Dean only notices now, after getting used to the lighting in the room -- is grasped tight by a Weeping Angel statue locked to the alcove wall. The statue looks more feral than the Angel of Water or any of the cherubs; it doesn't hide its face with palms, so all the fangs and wild fierce look is written clearly in each line and crack on its face. The stone on the statue is cracked and eroded, the eye sockets sunken deep in the face. It looks angry -- furious, perhaps -- which might have something to do with the long heavy chains that tether it to the plinth and the wall.

"No way Tardis can land in time turbulence like this, not even I can do that. And I took the Vortex Manipulator. So how did you?" the woman asks curiously, not giving the Angel holding her a second look, as if she's not noticing the dangerous situation she's in.

"Got help from some new friends." The Doctor taps Dean and Cas on the shoulders lightly. Dean is a little surprised at the word choice he used, but he's not complaining.

"I see." The woman regards them, not hiding at all the way her eyes checking both of them out, scanning up and down. Not in an uncomfortable way. More curious than anything. And she's enchanting enough to have a free pass anywhere anyway.

Dean meets her eyes while hers linger on his face. Dean notices at the same time how attractive and sexy she looks, and for some reason, somewhat familiar. He tries to scratch the memory where he might know her from -- the tight leather jacket, the bright red lips, all cleavage and curves -- he gasps quietly with realization, nudges Cas and whispers, "She's the one from the book."

"What book?" The woman watches him closely.

"Enough babbling," the rich man -- must be the so-called Mr. Grayle -- steps into the center of the room, demanding their attention. "What's going on? Who are you? Detective Malone, I demand answers!"

"Shush, grown-ups are talking." The woman shoots him a stern look with enough might, as if *she* were the owner of the place. The man gapes his mouth open unbelievably with no words coming out.

"*You* are Melody Malone?" Cas catches up too, realizing what Dean's telling him.

"And how did *you* know River is Melody?" Amy raises her question.

Cas answers River's question first, "I found your book in our motel, with Dean and my name in it."

He pulls the book out of his pocket and passes it over to Amy. The cover looks exactly like River.

"A book I haven't written yet. I see, a common problem with time travel." River glances at it, making a face. "I don't like the cover."

The Doctor stares at Cas. "And you didn't think to mention it earlier?"

Dean defends, "We didn't even know what that was."

"All the more reasons," River says calmly.

Amy opens the pages. "It has my name too," she tells them, "and Rory, and Doctor."

"I was wondering how you knew where to find me this time. I was *just* thinking about sending you a message," River says with a mild smile. "A kiss in time flux, or something you couldn't miss. Thought some future version of me already did something I haven't thought about."

The Doctor answers sheepishly, "Total coincidence this time, sorry, River. We were actually tracking Rory."

Grayle runs out of all his patience, raising his voice, "Okay, I've had enough of this nonsense. Guards! Get them out of here!"

"I wouldn't suggest that," the Doctor warns in a low voice.

The two hefty guards they met at the gate burst into the room, each having a gun in their hands, pointing menacingly at them.

Dean draws out his own gun, pointing at the taller one among the two. Cas steps closer to him, raising a palm in a defending gesture. The Doctor steps in front of River and Amy, pointing at the guards with his sonic screwdriver like a weapon.

"Very West Side Story," Dean comments. "What now? You're outnumbered."

"Not if I let the Angels in." Grayle threatens with a vicious smile.

"Risk sending yourself back in time? You wouldn't dare." The Doctor reads his face.

"How would you know?" Grayle challenges.

"There are an awful lot of locks on the door downstairs. And the blinding light here." The Doctor points out, meeting the man's mousey eyes, his tone icy. "You're scared. Which is good. Scare is good, it means you know they're dangerous. Because they *are*, beyond your puny little head's understanding. They are dangerous, they are patient, and they are fast, faster than any of us. No one stands a chance when they attack."

Grayle opens his palms, gesturing arrogantly at the luxurious, ancient-looking decorations and collections displayed around them, then at the chained statue in the alcove that still grips River's wrist. "Except I'm a collector. And you know what, they make the perfect collection."

"A collector and the New York crime boss, how does that work?" River provokes.

"Isn't that the same thing?" Grayle's eyes gleam. "Now, Detective, where are we? Oh, right, my friends," he nods at the group, leaving his glance especially longer on the Doctor, "why don't you do as I say, or you watch *her* suffer."

He flips the light switch on the wall before they can say anything. River gasps in the sudden darkness. All the lights are turned back on a second later.

The chained angel statue has moved in that blink of darkness. It dragged River closer to its body, the grip on her wrist is so tight and powerful that her whole arm is twisted outward at an odd angle. The Angel's right arm raises high with all the long claw nails out -- it's on the rim of a striking pose and there is no way to run. River grits her teeth, cursing loudly, "Damn you!"

"I hope you take it seriously now," Grayle smiles meaningfully at the rest of them. "One more flip, the Angel can snap her neck."

"What do you want?" The Doctor has burning fire in his eyes, his voice colder than a glacier.

"Those two, take them to the babies, like the other one." The man talks to the guards, gesturing to Dean and Amy.

Dean shifts his gun toward him. "Or I can just blast a hole in your chest," he spits.

"I assure you," Grayle says in his greasy voice. "I can flip the switch before you pull the trigger."

"Please, don't." The Doctor lowers his voice. Dean realizes he's talking to him. "And please take care of Amy, we'll come to you as soon as we can."

"Take me with them, then." The words surprise many of them, and it is Cas, stepping toward Grayle. "I'm no use to you here; let me go with them."

Grayle sizes him up with interest, glancing between him and Dean. "I do have some other plan for you," he says with a faintly amused smile.

"Cas --" Dean has lowered his weapon, letting himself be grabbed by the arms by the guard he was pointing his gun at earlier. The other man takes Amy, shoving her out.

Dean manages to turn his head and meet Cas's eyes even as he is on his way getting pushed out of the door. "Cas, I'll be fine. Don't do anything stupid."

He only gets time to see Cas's deeply worried eyes and creased furrows one more time, before he gets hustled downstairs, into the cellar -- more like a dungeon, to be precise.

The guards dump them both into the utterly dark space, the only light coming from the open door.

"The lights are out --" the tall one leers at them from the top of the stairs, "you'll last longer with those."

A box of matches is thrown into the place, landing on the floor next to Amy's feet.

"What do you care?" Dean asks furiously.

"It's funnier." He grins with teeth, shutting the door. There is the sound of bolts slamming.

The place is drowned in complete darkness.

Dean/Doctor: "Doc" "Don't call me Doc, it's Doctor to you"

## Chap 6 The Roman In The Cellar

> (Dean POV)(Act 2 plot point 1)
>
> Dean/Amy goes to cellar where Rory was, the match in dark scene, Dean/Amy talk (realize Rory was there from burned match), Dean protect Amy & get zapped away
>
> chapter end last transition sentence, Cas/Doctor: "Where is Dean/Rory"

Amy strikes a match. The dancing flame lightens up a tiny corner of the place, dark shadow looming in from every direction. Dean never knew a cellar could look so dreadful, boundless, and infinite.

They try to examine the space in the dim light.

There is a broken chandelier not far from the end of the stairs. The glasses shatter on the floor, leaving sharp pieces and shards all over like hidden blades, shimmering with flame's reflection. Another empty matchbox has been tipped upside down on the floor, a dozen charred match stumps scattering around it.

"Careful," Dean breathes. Amy startles, dropping the match.

The weak flame dies on the floor a second later. The utter black takes over. The sound of some distorted giggle and pitter-patter of small stone feet stepping on the broken glasses comes from the darkness.

They gasp together. Amy strikes a second match.

From the flickering light, they see a small group of cherub statues crowding in on them. The little stone babies, barely able to stand straight, lie around on the dusty floor, chubby little hands and legs entangled together. Looking as harmless and innocent as the ones from Bethesda Fountain looked initially. But they know better than being fooled by the look.

They stare at the cherubs, edging slowly backward on the stairs, ascending to where the door is. Amy moves on to higher steps. Dean follows her, keeping a barrier between her and the statues. His shadow stretches long in the faint flame and merges with the rest of the darkness.

Amy curses when the match burns her finger.

She drops the burned-down match and hurriedly strikes another.

The cherubs -- there are three of them -- have moved. They turned to where Dean and Amy are, frozen in the act of getting to their feet. Their tiny faces turn feral and full of fangs. Dean stares at them without blinking. But without a steady light source, this does very little help.

"We are dead," Amy says with a trembling, dreadful voice. "The stone babies are going to send us back in time, and we'll just die of old age somewhere in the past. I'm never going to see Rory again."

Tears stream down her face.

The match burns out again. Her quiet sob mixes with the creepy giggles.

"We'll find a way," Dean stumbles up a few steps on the stairs in the complete darkness, blindly looking for the way. "The smart people upstairs, your Doctor and my -- and Cas, they'll think of something. We just have to last until they come."

Amy lights another match with unsteady fingers.

The cherubs reached the lowest level of the stairs, and the two of them are on the highest, no more distance to put between them. The cellar door is shut tight and unmistakably latched from the outside, no way to open it from inside. Their lives are as long as the match lasts, until the baby statues climb up the stairs.

"How many matches left?" Dean asks.

"Does it matter?" Amy glances at the box and answers anyway, "Ten, maybe fifteen."

"Means one minute, maybe two." Dean thinks quickly.

He takes off his tie. "Burn this next," he tells her. "Should buy us another two minutes."

Dean starts taking off his suit.

"What are you doing?" Amy panics.

"Improvise," he holds the suit jacket like a muleta, descending the stairs cautiously. "Just keep the light going."

Amy does as she's told. The cotton tie burns from the end, the flame is more steady than the one from the matches, but it still burns too quickly.

"I liked that tie," Dean tells the cherubs in grudge, "and this suit. Now I need to get a new one, and it's your fault."

He covers the baby angel statues with his suit, kneeling down to turn over the bundle, tying the sleeves and the lower hem together in a dead knot. And then leaves the bundle in the middle of the shattered chandelier's glass shards on the floor.

The light goes out just as he finishes the work.

"Come back quickly," Amy urges him, striking another match.

Dean stares at the cloth bundle as he moves back to the top of the stairs. The bundle didn't move in the blink of darkness between the lights.

Between that match burning out and them lighting the next, the bundle still remains in the same place, not an inch closer to the bottom of the stairs than they were. They don't hear any giggle or pitter-patter either.

Amy lets out a long breath, "How do you know it would work?"

"I don't," Dean admits. "Lucky guess. Figured if they couldn't see us, they might lose the nerve to move, so I took my chance. Or at least it will be hell trying to climb up the stairs like that, have you seen a three-legged race?"

"Nice job," Amy sits down on the top step, still holding the matchbox tight. There are still perhaps about ten matches left, and she doesn't want to stop lighting, even just for ten seconds of comfort.

"Hey," Dean puts a tentative pat on her shoulder, "we'll be fine."

"Thanks." Amy nods once, jaw still tight, wiping her face. "You know, Doctor says that a lot too, even when we first met, he said to me, 'You know when grown-ups tell you everything's going to be fine, and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?' right before he said 'Everything's going to be fine.' I was only seven." She chuckles tightly at the memory.

"Was everything really fine then?" Dean asks gently, sitting down on the stairs one level lower than her. The cold cellar door is over their heads.

"Not really," Amy says, "there was a crack on my wall, which turned out to be a crack in the time and space, and then it killed Rory and wiped my memory, and he came back becoming a Roman robot, and we exploded the universe."

"Wow," Dean blinks, "that's gonna make my story of blowing up Hell and letting Lucifer out sound so lame. What happened next?"

Amy sniffs slightly, "We fixed it together. The Doctor saved the world, and we all went home. Rory and I got married, happily ever after."

Dean knows the sound of tears in a sentence when he hears one.

"And yet here you are --" He says slowly. He doesn't mean to pry, but it seems to calm her down.

"We tried," she tells him, "the normal life, we really tried when the Doctor was not around. Rory worked in a hospital; I had a blog. We spent a year in our house, watching a box." She trails off. Dean doesn't rush.

"It feels like yesterday," Amy continues, "it might actually *be* yesterday -- Tardis can send us back right when we left, so it would almost be like we never left. But then the Doctor would drop by again, have some dinner, or watch TV with us. He doesn't have to say anything but we know he can't just leave us, and to be honest, how can you -- how can *anyone* -- stop following him around, traveling through all the time and space, fighting monsters, saving the universe? This 'other life', we call it 'Doctor life', it's part of me now. I think it's always been."

"It's like the hunter life and the normal life," Dean murmurs quietly, realizing the similarity.

They decided to save all the remaining matches for the moment, sitting quietly in the darkness on the top stairs. The air is quiet with only their breath and low voice. If the statues manage to shake off the wrap and move again, they should be able to hear them first. So for now, in the quietness and the darkness, they should be safe. Dean just wishes Cas and the rest of them could figure things out quickly on the other side of this heavy cellar door.

"You are a hunter?" Amy asks.

Dean nods, then remembers she can't see him in the darkness. "Yeah," he admits, "not really an FBI agent, sorry. Should have done a proper introduction back there. Hi, I'm Dean Winchester. I'm a hunter."

He holds out a hand in the dark blindly, meeting Amy's in the middle.

"Amy Pond, I'm um -- a traveler, or an adventurer, I guess."

They shake their hands.

"And the dude with me is Castiel, Angel of the Lord."

Amy stiffens reflexively when the word "angel" is mentioned. Dean notices it from the hands they connected.

"Sorry," he says quickly, "you know, it sounds really strange, the Weeping Angel and the actual angel I know, I was so used to angels being only dudes in suits like him."

Amy nods in understanding, then asks, "Are other angels all like him?"

"No, there is no one like him," Dean answers automatically. "He's..." he trails off temporarily, staring at the dark space. "He saved me from Hell, he rebelled, he fell. He died so many times, but he always comes back to me, always helps me when I need him. Yeah, he's the only one like that." A small smile crawls onto his lips that no one sees.

"Rory is like that, too," Amy tells him. "I lost count of how many times he's... gone." She chokes. The blackness brings the truth out easily. "You know, I crashed a van once, after he was killed. Because I decided, if that was a world I had to live without him, I don't want it. I wasn't sure how I felt about him until he was gone, and at that time, I never even told him I loved him. I don't know what I'd do without him. And lucky for me, it turned out to be an evil Dream Lord's dream world. I was so happy we got a second chance, then third, then fourth. I lost count. Rory was taken from me a lot, but he always comes back."

Dean stares at the pure darkness before his eyes, blinking hard, thinking he must be hallucinating to see images flashing by on the black curtain -- the rain of exploded flesh and blood, the floating trench coat on the lake water, the hand slipping from his palm. "I know what you mean," he replies, his voice hoarse.

He can feel Amy turn her head to him, cloth rustling. If they can see, her eyes must be searching his face.

Silence falls between them. They breathe shallowly and slowly. There is no sound or light in the cellar, as if time and the universe don't exist in this small space.

Then Amy speaks again. "I've never been loved by anyone like that before; it terrifies me," she says slowly. "We grew up together, I've known him my entire life, and then he waited two thousand years for me, alone, to save me. I didn't even know." There is the sound of tears dropping to the floor. She whispers, "He died for me so many times. How can you love back someone who loves you like that? Is that even possible?"

Dean swallows hard. "I don't know." His voice is a croak. "You save him back, whatever it takes."

Amy wipes her face, "You're right, now you get it why I *have* to save him. And," she pauses for a beat, "if for whatever reason I fail, or I get killed, or sent away by the Weeping Angels --"

"Amy --"

"Let me finish," Amy's voice is now firm and steady, though still wet, "can you promise to save him for me, and tell him that I loved him, and that I'm sorry, I tried, I died trying?"

"I --"

"Please?"

"Okay," Dean swallows the lump in his throat. "Okay. Amy Pond, I promise you. Is that why you're telling me all that?"

"I don't know, just in case," Amy says, a lot calmer than before. "And I will try my best to do the same for you and Castiel, if the worst comes."

She strikes a match right then, flashing bright both their solemn faces.

"What?" Dean is surprised, staring into her sparkling eyes.

"I'm not blind, Dean," she says, looking into his eyes, "I see the way you two look at each other. It's the same way Rory looks at me, every single time."

The match burns out.

Dean can hear blood pumping in his eardrum, deafening him, muting him completely.

Except, it's not the pounding of his heart that he's hearing.

The cellar door above their heads is punched from the other side. There are noises of fighting and yelling, and then a gun shot. Metal dropping on the surface, something heavy collapsing onto the floor shortly after. Dean's heart clutches in worry.

"Amy!" The Doctor shouts, followed by a series of familiar metallic whirling sounds from the sonic screwdriver. "Amy, if you're in there, stay clear!"

Amy and Dean hurry back down a few steps in the darkness, covering their ears, looking up at their way out, waiting.

"Dean!" Cas's voice passes through the noise.

"Cas." Dean's heart skips a beat, jumping too lightly. Cas is okay, and he's coming for him, again.

The cellar door is blasted open, two metal plates flying into the space. Dean covers Amy with his body, getting a harsh hit on the back, throwing both of them down to the bottom of the stairs.

"Amy!" The Doctor thunders down, beaming the sonic screwdriver at the dark space like a torch, pulling Amy into a tight hug.

"Doctor," she clutches on his jacket, "it's so nice to see you again."

Cas follows into the cellar in a rush, looking around, asking in s tense voice, "Where is Dean?"

Amy turns sharply, pointing behind her, "He's right here --"

But there is no one there. The air is empty where they landed from the blast.

The chilling giggles echo in the dark shadow.

"Angels." The Doctor hurries backward, taking Amy's arm, leading her back onto the stairs.

He points his sonic screwdriver lower, its green light shining on the broken chandelier. On the floor, near a wall by a pile of shattered glasses, a ragged suit jacket lies open, two cherub statues frozen in their gaze.

### Act 1

Unsteady on his feet, Dean staggers at the sudden change of the ground and chilly air. Humid outdoor air replaces the stale underground air, coming to his face.

One second he was ten feet from Cas, the next, he doesn't know where he is again.

For that blink of a second, he swears he saw Cas standing right there, at the opening of the stairs, stepping down hurriedly toward him. He wanted to call him, he wanted to laugh with joy that once again they escaped a dangerous situation, and right that moment, he felt a cold pull at the heel of his feet. And the ground spun under his feet.

He is outside -- still New York, undoubtedly, considering he can see the light from the Statue of Liberty on the Elise Island from across the water. He is in the south bay of Manhattan, then. The ground is wet with reflections glinting on the puddles, just like the after-rain road they first stepped on when Cas first flew them to 1938. So if he's lucky enough -- Dean puts a mental question mark on the assumption -- it might be the same rain, and he might still be around the same time, give or take. Fingers crossed.

The street view looks different, though. There is no more posh, wealthy collector's mansion, only a much taller and much plainer-looking apartment building standing before him. Each window is tight and small, tiling side by side like a beehive. Whoever lives in there, the space must be as small as single motel rooms. Dean feels bad for them.

A bright red neon sign reads "Winter Quay" hanging on the very top of the building.

There is barely any light coming out from the windows, with the majority of them closed tight and only a handful of them open. If he looks closely enough, there are people sitting next to the windows, idly looking out. He has glimpses of some old people moving sluggishly behind the windows.

Not just any apartment building, then, but an elderly living building. Dean thinks, instantly feeling a prickle at the back of his neck. He doesn't like it, but he can't really tell why, just the usual hunter's instinct kicking in. Something about this building gives him the same feeling whenever they have to go into a haunted house -- the lingering sense of death and a creepy sense of something terribly wrong there. The places where most cases happen and people die. Talking about heebie jeebies.

He reaches for the back of his belt automatically and then his pocket, his fingers closing on empty air both times. The damned Grayle and his guards took his gun and phone, of course. Dean curses quietly, clenching his fist.

He doesn't like it -- he's all alone, weapon-less, backup-less, clueless. He doesn't know when or where he is, and there is this creepy-looking old people's house waiting for him to enter. The gate creaks open by itself as Dean looks, like an opening mouth waiting to swallow him in.

"Standard opening of a B-movie, replacing ketchup with blood. Great." He murmurs to himself, wondering if there is anywhere he can go other than stepping into the unquestionably biggest creepy house that looks like trying to invite him in.

There is a fluttering sound of wings somewhere behind him. Dean turns sharply, but he can see nothing but trees jittering in the light breeze. The yellow bulbs of the street lamps are only bright enough to light up maybe twenty feet of the road around them. Something lurks in the dark shadow.

Dean turns back to the apartment building. The two angel statues standing by the gate have shifted their postures. Dean's pretty sure their hands were covering their faces before he turned, and now their hands are lowered, their faces showing. Their wings are furled close to their backs, both wearing long robes.

"Dammit, more Weeping Angels," he curses, staring at both of them, not daring to blink the slightest. "Don't tell me every single statue in Manhattan is a freaking Weeping Angel."

The dark night doesn't answer his question, only sending more movement behind his back. There is no way he'd turn around to check if it's more angel statues shaking the trees or just wind, with the two very adult-looking angels eying hungrily in his direction.

Walking inside the obvious trap defenseless seems to be the only option now, whether he likes it or not.

Dean mentally calculates the route where he can walk into the gate of the building without looking away from both gatekeeper Angels. The conclusion seems to be impossible, but he bets his luck.

Dean walks toward the gate, feeling his eyes start to sore again. He blinks one eye at a time, barely wetting the dried eyes. The statues didn't move.

There is a stretch of stairs leading to the door, five steps, give or take. He has to measure the distance with the periphery of his eyes, keeping the focus on the statues. For the first time, he feels two eyes are not enough. He can't help wondering what Cas's "eyes in all directions" look like.

No way of keeping eyes on both angels now, Dean holds his breath and dashes into the gate, then takes a sharp turn the moment he's inside. He gasps as the gatekeeper angels stand right behind his back, face to face with fierce expressions. Their fingertips might only be an inch away from him, if he hadn't run faster than he ever did in his life.

Dean stares at their faces, and the statues remain still. "You are really some ugly son of bitches, you know that?" He spits at the female angel statue with short curly hair. He imagines it might be supposed to portray some beautiful, fairy-tale looking, gentle, halo-and-harp style angel, and now, they are all nothing but monsters. The other male angel looks as strong and fit as Michelangelo's David, his socket deep and chasmal, his nose tall and straight. Dean has a weird feeling of familiarity but he can't quite place it.

He keeps eye contact with both of them while backing up slowly, pulling one leaf of the door over, then the other, bolting them tight. Looking around, he spots a long, loose pole lying by the doorframe. He blockades it on the door handles for good measure.

Regarding his work, Dean lets out a short, relieved breath.

A man talks behind him, "It won't stop them, I tried."

Dean jumps and almost hits him in the face.

The Coffee Guy rubs his shoulder that just got punched, moaning in complaint.

"Sorry," Dean says apologetically, then recognizes him, "It's you. The Coffee Guy."

The guy raises his eyebrows, the same recognition dawns on him, a tight joy showing. "You're the one from Central Park," then the raised tip of his lips quickly drops, "I'm sorry, if you're here, did you also get sent back by the Angels? River told me a little bit, but I got no idea..."

"No," Dean answers immediately, thinking about Cas's wings, but then the cellar, "Yes. Sorry, yes and no. It's a bit confusing."

"Rory Williams, also confused." The man holds out a hand.

"Dean Winchester." Dean shakes his hand. "Amy told me all about you."

Rory's jaw immediately tightens, "Amy is here too? Where is she? Is she safe?"

Dean holds up two hands in a soothing pose, "Calm down, she's okay -- at least last I saw her, Doctor got her."

"Doctor is here too?" Rory is visibly more relieved.

"Yeah, your whole big happy family, Amy, Doctor, River, everyone. You guys are having a family trip or something?" Dean can't help but remark.

Rory shakes his head, shifting his feet restlessly on the floor. "We were just hanging out in New York. Then everything went wrong, as usual." He looks a bit frustrated, but not irritated, as if already getting too used to being thrown into a rabbit hole of trouble.

"Things always went wrong, didn't they?" Dean seconds that in annoyance.

He looks around the place, examining the lobby they're in. It's a shabby place, bare and dusty, old already even as they're in the thirties, god knows how long the building has been standing and probably no one has tended to it ever since. The typical look of a deserted place. Dean can't help wondering if those old people he caught sight of from outside by the windows, if they are ghosts or residents.

Dim street light passes into the space from a grimy clerestory window high above reach, near the ceiling. The metal plaque by the exposed elevator well shows at least seventy floors, with twenty to thirty rooms on each story.

Dean does a quick mental math and frowns deeply. "Holy, that's gotta be like two thousand people here." If all the rooms are occupied.

"Why would anyone live in a place like this?" Rory asks beside him, staring at the same sign.

"Low rent?" Dean offers half-heartedly.

Right then, the gate rattles. The long rod he stuck on the handles is shaken loose. The door latches shudder like giants with great strength are shaking it from the outside, trying desperately to break in.

They gasp, hurrying toward the gate together, pushing with their backs to fight the door shut.

"Or the Angels force them to stay," Rory notes the obvious.

"Thanks, Sherlock," Dean grunts, pushing at one leaf of the door while Rory holds the other. "Any idea how to get out of here?"

Rory throws him an unhappy look, "I wouldn't be here if I knew."

Dean squints at the new finding he just noticed. "How long have you been here? You knew it wouldn't work when I blocked the door, you said you tried."

"I don't know, maybe minutes, maybe hours." Rory considers, then shakes his head. "My watch stopped working, I have no idea."

Dean glances at his own watch. The fingers are not stopped -- they are moving, but they're moving pointlessly, they skip ahead then move back, they shiver at one point then suddenly start ticking again, then hesitate again. The watch has no idea about the time. *The time flux is scrambled.*

"Any idea what the worst thing could happen if you get touched by one of those again?" Dean tries to prepare for the worst. Maybe they can still try to make a run, the brutal force way.

"Send you further back in time," Rory deadpans. "Why wouldn't they?"

Dean sighs, "So it's like the airplane chess -- get flown right back to the hangar. Friggin' Angels! The worst monster ever!"

The rattle on the door quiets for a moment, but they dare not move away.

Dean doesn't know how long he can keep holding on to it. His muscles are sore. By the look on Rory's face, the man is about the same on the edge.

"Tell me about Amy," Rory says suddenly. "Tell me what she's like when you last met her."

"What, you want a heart-to-heart *now*?" Dean disbelieves.

"If the Angels break in and send me back again, that might be the last thing I'd ever hear about Amy ever again," Rory says as if it's obvious. "So yeah, I want to know as much about her as I still can. The memory would be all I ever have."

"What's the matter with you two?" Dean sighs, staring at the young man that has a stubborn yet eager look in his eyes. "She said she loved you, more than anything," he tells him dutifully.

Rory's eyes brighten up like the Sun rising from the horizon. "She said that?"

"Why would I lie about things like that?" Dean's eyes study his face, even the tiniest crinkle glinting with happiness. Is it what love would do to a person?

Eyes unfocused on the dim air of the lobby, Rory says, "You know, sometimes I still can't believe how lucky I am. For a really long time, I thought she wouldn't ever love me the way I love her. Did she tell you we grew up together, and that we were always best friends?"

"Not the 'best friends' part." Dean swallows, feeling a funny twist in the gut.

"We were practically together every single day. I was always so happy to just *be* around her. But she never really looked at me that way. And you know what she said when she told people why we were just 'best friends'?" Rory pauses for a brief moment, not really waiting for an answer. Dean just waits.

"Because she thought I wasn't into girls." Rory chuckles softly. "Because I never spared a look at any other girls."

"That's how she realized you love her," Dean guesses.

"Yeah. Like I can look at anyone other than her." Rory smiles, sinking in his memory. "Then we got engaged, then she ran away with the Doctor the night before our wedding."

"What?" Dean almost laughs, but he manages to stifle the chuckle at the last moment. "Isn't that a little too late for cold feet?"

"I think she was never really sure --" the gleams in Rory's eyes drop a few degrees, he stares at the dusty tiled floor, "-- or it's me that's never confident in her enough. When we travel with the Doctor, I always think one day she'd run away with him and never come back again, choosing him over me, choosing the 'Doctor life' over our normal life. I mean, why wouldn't she? The adventures and stars, killing monsters and saving the world -- that's the story of amazing Amy Pond. And silly old me? All I ever really want is to live in a peaceful small town, with her, raising our babies, growing old slowly together. But I wasn't sure that's what she wants too. And I was okay with it."

"But even so, you waited for her for two thousand years," Dean remembers what Amy told him.

Rory nods like it's nothing.

"Why?" Dean can't help but ask.

"Do you have anyone you'd do anything to protect, save them whatever it takes?"

"I guess," Dean says, shifting his feet.

"Then you should know how it feels to leave them behind. I couldn't do that. So I stayed. I had to make sure she's safe," Rory answers easily.

"She doesn't even know," Dean says.

"It doesn't matter," Rory says with a firm voice. "To save her, I can do anything."

"Even condemn the world?" Dean doesn't know why this slips out of his tongue.

"Hopefully not," Rory thinks about it, "but if it means she's saved, then I don't know, maybe. Not like we haven't done it before."

Dean raises his eyebrows, "The 'exploding the universe' thing?"

Rory nods sheepishly, "More than once." Then adds quickly, "Sorry." As if afraid it personally offended Dean.

"Cool," Dean grins slightly, "I'm feeling so much better for jump-starting the Apocalypse, twice. And then my best friend let human-eating monsters out running around all over the world."

"We restarted the universe, though, for the record." Rory looks like compelled to add that. "No one remembers anything; history is back on track."

"And we locked the monsters back into the monsterland." Dean mirrors. "Cost me a year in that place, though."

"Is that your version of 'waiting two thousand years'?" Rory detects the tone acutely.

Dean widens his eyes, a little surprised at the way he put it, but thinking it through... "Actually now that you said it," he says slowly, surprised again, this time at how accurate the analogy actually is. "Yes, it is."

"I just couldn't leave the place until I found him, but then I almost lost him again because he didn't want to be saved. If the angels didn't save him, he didn't come back to me again, I don't know what I'd do." Dean grimaces, doesn't know why he starts telling this stranger -- maybe already a friend now? Since they've been sharing stories -- the things between him and Cas, but what the hell, they might die any moment anyway. Better than stew in the dark and horror.

"I killed all the monsters I could hunt down to look for him. I think the whole Purgatory knew I was looking for him by the time I found him." Dean remembers the looks on those monsters' faces, the way they smirk and call him "his angel." Purgatory was pure, so pure that he couldn't even feel his cheek burn, because that was true. Cas was -- is, has been, and always will be -- his angel. *How can you love back someone who loves you like that? Died for you so many times? -- You save him back, whatever it takes.*

"I was an idiot," Dean laughs at himself quietly, "not seeing what it is. Or maybe I knew, all along, but never let myself see it."

Rory glances at him. "I'm glad you figured it out, mate," he says sincerely.

Dean ducks his head, "But how does that work out?" Because things are never easy and cut clean with them, aren't they? Even with that -- the new realization -- in mind, that still gotta be more trouble than he knows how to handle. There always gotta be complications and frictions, or things like ideal lives that you imagined differently. Everything standing in between -- sometimes it almost feels like the whole world stands in between them.

"It can't possibly be 'happily ever after.'" Dean says.

"We don't live in fairy tales," Rory gives him a look, "even Amy and I almost got divorced."

Dean drops his jaw. "How?" He doesn't need to deliver the whole question: I see how deep in love you two are, how can you two possibly walk away from each other? If even you two can't work it out, does that mean...?

Rory closes his eyes, refusing the pained memory. "We just... fell apart, I guess. Normal life happened, the Doctor didn't come to us for months, and we had a big fight. It happens."

"How did you fix it?" Dean stares at the middle of the dim, shabby room, seeing holy fire burning around the angel in a circle. And the last look they shared before he left him there. He blinks the image away. He hopes never to see that look again.

"Oh, um, Amy almost got killed by the Daleks, and we saved each other," Rory replies evenly, "because I need her, and she needs me."

"Of course." Dean actually laughs. Of course. How can it be any other way?

Right then, the gate rattles harshly again, catching them in a moment of laxity. It sways fiercely as if the strongest hurricane blows at it from the other side. The latch flies away and the door sways open.

Dean and Rory get shoved heavily away by the door leaves, thrown backward into the middle of the room.

Two Weeping Angels stand in the open doorway.

<br>

### Act 2

"Don't blink!" Dean gasps, stumbling to his feet. Rory does the same, pulling himself up.

The two Angel statues are the same two standing guards at the gate earlier, holding out their hands in the pose of pushing the door open. The female one has unfurled her wings slightly; the male one, without hands cupping his face, shows side-swept fringe on his forehead. Why on earth do they look familiar? Dean scratches his head.

"Why the hell are they just biting our tails?" Dean steps backward slowly, putting some distance between them and the statues, the distance that he has seen them cross within a blink.

He barks at them, "Come on, I didn't do anything to you."

"I don't think they care," Rory draws back by his side. "What do we do?"

The elevator well is a hollow metal structure, the classic ancient design from the thirties with bare bars and cables that are not protected with sealed sides. They might be able to climb in it to the second floor, but they'd be killed easily and nastily if the lift decides to drop or the angels flap their wings. That leaves only --

"The stairs. Where are the stairs?" Dean asks frantically.

"Locked," Rory breaks his last hope. "I checked before you arrived; all the doors are locked."

Of course.

Dean has backed to the wall right next to the elevator, punching blindly at the mounted buttons.

"Come on!!" He begs the damned thing.

He stares at the Weeping Angels without a blink. The two of them cast long shadows on the floor. The street lamp outside flickers dangerously. "No, no, no --"

The elevator comes to life like a miracle, clanking down to their level, opening the barred door.

"Go! Go!!" Dean yells, fingers fumbling on the wall, eyes on the Angels, moving toward the lift blindly.

Rory dashes into the lift, holding the door for him. "I got them, come on!"

Dean takes the last two steps, jumping into the ancient-looking metal cage.

The rusty bars clink clank before him, sliding closed. The lift starts rising.

"Which floor are we going to?" Dean asks Rory.

"No idea," Rory searches the four sides in vain. There is no button or control handle inside.

A large human-sized poster at the back of the elevator gives them a jump. The Statue of Liberty in the image looks as realistic as the real thing. Too damn many statues in this city. Dean decides he would never come to New York ever again, if he manages to get out of here.

The wheezing sound of the old mechanics echoes loudly in the place, disturbing dust in the stale air.

Dean and Rory watch stories after stories rising into their view then being left behind. All have the same long, bleak look. An empty and straight corridor stretches in front of the lift on each floor, covered in thick scarlet velvet carpet. Not a single person in view.

The lift comes to a halt at a floor near fifty or sixty levels high -- they lost count when it got above thirty. The thing doesn't seem to be willing to move further up, so Dean and Rory have no choice but to walk into the corridor. The elevator clanks back down, leaving a dark, empty well in the space.

The bulbs on the ceiling give off smoky, tawny light, barely lighting the corridor.

Dean leads the way, looking left and right. The carpet muffles their footsteps; no wonder the whole place is quiet like a tomb. They don't even dare to breathe too loudly.

The doors have two-digit numbers on them showing the apartment numbers, and almost all have name tags labelled next to them: "W. Wallace", "J. Watson", "M. Wheeler", "J. Whittaker"...

Dean recognizes one from the missing people report he and Cas saw in the newspaper that morning -- this morning, this very same day's morning when he was having that awesome breakfast. God, that feels like ancient ago. At least it seems like he has found all the missing people, then, if they are all in this very building. But how on earth can they get everyone outta here, with probably a million creepy Weeping Angel statues guarding the place and the whole of Manhattan?

Dean shifts his attention to the end of the corridor. The light on the ceiling is not bright enough to shine all the way toward the end.

"Dean --" Rory calls after him.

"Give me a sec," Dean says, walking cautiously toward the shadowed end wall. An instinctive feeling growls in his brain like some answers are dying to crawl their way out, waiting for him to put the last missing piece into the puzzle. And something tells him the answer is *right there*.

The stone alcove in the wall blends in naturally with the rest of the decoration, looking exactly like a coherent part of the building -- as old and dusty as everything else is, covered by cobwebs.

Dean stands close enough to see there is an Angel statue sitting in the alcove, but not close enough to have a clear look at the face. This one looks particularly familiar, but her face is hidden in her palms. Her short, straight hair dangles down before her ears, reaching her shoulders.

Dean knows intuitively that if the stone statue has colors, they would be dark black.

"Dean!" Rory raises his voice more alarmingly, half a corridor away from him. Distantly, the elevator dings again.

"Coming!" Dean answers without turning back, keeping his eyes on the statue.

Then he blinks deliberately.

The statue shifted its pose. The Angel has lowered her hands. She looked up from her sitting position, two hollow stone eyes looking straight at Dean. The hairs dropped from her face, showing the soft lines of her lips and face.

Realization hits him like lightning.

"Tessa," Dean breathes out the Angel's name in shock.

The reaper he remembered from four years ago, the angel of death, is just another one of many real angels. All the dots are connected together now.

That's what they are, the Weeping Angels -- the real angels, confined in a stone body, restricted by some quantum lock. But they're still the angels he knew, not some new monster species like the Doctor said.

"Oh God, I'm so dumb, of course," Dean gasps, backing away from the stoned Tessa, back to where Rory stands. That's exactly why he felt like he knew them, because he really does. The gatekeeper angels down there, aren't they the ones coming for Cas when he was broken? Inias or what's-his-name? And the other one with curly hair, isn't she the Angel of Water Cas pointed to him? The one called Hannah. Must have gotten bored with Bethesda Plaza. Both of them Cas mentioned had gone to Purgatory for him and hurt by the Leviathans.

He claps on his head. "I have to tell Cas." Dean sends out a rushed prayer as he walks back down the corridor.

He is back next to Rory then, who points at two side-by-side doors with his mouth open. "Dean, look at this!"

"Watch out for that angel!" Dean tells him, then he turns.

Right on these two doors, the name tags unmistakably spell out:

"R. Williams"

and

"D. Winchester"

The elevator lets out a final ringing sound, and stops at their level.

### Act 1

*Thirty minutes ago, in Grayle's mansion.*

<br>

"What are you going to do to them?" Cas glares at Grayle, as Dean and Amy are pushed out the door. He wants nothing more than to follow, to strike them down and bring Dean to somewhere safe, bring everyone to somewhere safe. He hates the way his feet shake and he can't quite feel his grace or his wings -- he hates being weak and doing nothing but watching Dean suffer, and that is where all his thoughts center. But Grayle makes a gesture, pointing a finger at him, catching his attention.

"I'd worry about yourself first if I were you, sweetheart," Grayle says in an almost sweet voice, gesturing at the light switch his left hand is still hovering over. "And don't you move. You do anything, lights off, she dies." He shifts that index finger at River. River tries to struggle again, but her wrist is held so tightly by the Angel, there is not any chance of slipping off.

The lines around Cas's eyes are pressed tight. He glances at River, then meets the Doctor's eyes. He forces his fists lower, inch by inch.

"You, too. Put down that thing, will you? Then we can talk." Grayle points at the sonic screwdriver in the Doctor's hand. The Doctor makes a growling face, but he leaves the screwdriver on the floor.

"Happy?" he grits.

Grayle hums, pleased with himself. "I would never know you have so much more use than I thought, Detective," he says to River without looking at her.

"I assure you, whatever you're going to do, you *do not* want to piss off those two boys," River says, voice carefully controlled. "They are so much more than what they look like."

"I wouldn't worry too much," Grayle answers, grinning, turning his attention back to Cas and the Doctor, eying them like a collector regarding a pair of ancient Chinese vases from two thousand years ago in a museum. "In fact, I'm counting on that."

Cas squints at him. The Doctor follows his gaze. "What do you mean?"

Grayle doesn't answer immediately, and one of the two guards comes back right then. "Tie them up," he waves him over and gestures at them.

He makes sure his finger doesn't leave the light switch when Cas and the Doctor shoot murderous looks at him. He raises a challenging eyebrow, pointedly tilting his chin at River. Neither of them resists as they're tied up.

The guard is very thorough with ropes and chains, wrapping around their bodies, making tight knots behind them, and a second layer of iron chain locking their neck, hands, and feet to the ground -- just like how the Weeping Angel statue is chained to the alcove.

Rough metals and fibers brush against his skin through the ragged cloth, Cas gets reminded of his cuts from the flight, still fresh, some of them still bleeding. He can feel the grace flow sluggishly inside him. He barely scraped enough grace when he had to stand with Dean in that brief gun-fight moment, knowing he should at least have *something* ready in case he needed to protect him, protect all of them. Now that the moment is over, he realizes he has pulled most of the grace away from where it was trying to heal his body. His body must look even worse from the outside, but he can't really spare any thought for himself.

Grayle walks slowly closer as they are tied up and not able to move, closing in on Cas, eying his bloody wounds and cuts on the chest almost admiringly. A look of awe, but looking down, as if he's nothing more than a beautiful specimen he collected, and now he's just enjoying the view. "You're not human, aren't you?" he says with widened eyes.

Cas realizes he must be watching his leaking grace through the wounds on the vessel. Sometimes it's so easy to forget he's not human, especially when Dean is around. He doesn't treat him as if he's anything different, anything more, or anything less. He treats him like an equal, a friend. Apparently other human beings are not like him.

"You will make such a fascinating collection. I cannot wait to hear what everyone says when they see I acquired such a pure and bright creature," Grayle speaks as if he discovered a new species when traveling through some remote rainforest.

Cas can do nothing but glare at the middle-aged man taking control. He finds his mind keeps slipping to Dean, wondering how he's doing right now, where he is, whether his situation would be any better than his or worse, thinking of the danger he put all of them in by flying them here. For a split second, he's distracted, forgetting the man before him.

"I have to ask, what are you?" Grayle holds out a finger, lifting his chin up, observing his face with great interest.

Cas snaps his head hard, trying to shake his hand off. The chain rattles heavily, dragging him down, exhausting his already wounded body.

"Naughty," Grayle tuts, taking his hand back. "Very defiant. Would you rather be tied to that Angel instead?"

Cas glances at the Angel statue. The face of the chained Angel statue is so hollow and broken beyond recognition, but similar to Hannah's statue back at the fountain, for some reason, he thinks he can still sense a familiarity in it. If it's the statue of some other angel he'd known, it's not entirely impossible. But he still can't understand how it happens; it never happened before -- angels aren't usually tied to their vessels, let alone statues of their images; the Lord had demanded no image in the form of anything in the very early Ten Commandments.

Cas tries to channel some of his sense toward the statue, to feel her, to hear her. She's suffered greatly, Cas thinks, she must have been constrained by this man for a very long time, starved and tortured, until one day, she would be eroded to nothing but a pile of sand and dust, like all humans after they die, like all stars after they die.

"Do you realize she's screaming?" Cas says angrily, before he can stop himself. He doesn't know why he said that, but he doesn't stop. "They can feel pain. And others can hear it."

He can feel the Doctor and River's eyes land on him, heavier and more gingerly than before.

"Good," Grayle answers with a grin. "I was wondering about that. I don't want all my effort to go unnoticed."

"And what *effort* is that, exactly? By sending people to torture rooms? Sending them to danger, to death?" The Doctor cuts in, eyes burning with flames of fury. "Did you realize those are all good people, important people, people others care about and would do anything to save?"

Grayle's attention is captured by him. He moves to stand before him now, scrutinizing the Doctor in a similar manner to the way he treated Castiel. "And why do you care? Who are you?"

"I'm the Doctor." He looks at the human dead in the eyes, keeping his words weighted.

"Doctor who?"

"Ha!" The Doctor grins, his mood visibly getting better just from hearing that.

Grayle narrows his eyes. "You don't even have a name, why do you have so many hearts for others?"

"I only have two, hardly 'too many'," the Doctor answers casually, then his face glooms. "Though I guess compared to you, with no heart, it does seem a bit too many."

"Doctor --!" River raises her voice alarmingly suddenly, eyes on the door's direction.

The Doctor turns his head sharply, so does Cas. Even Grayle pauses and looks over their shoulders to watch. A flash of lightning sparks in the air, as if tearing open the fabric of reality, and a figure squeezes through.

And her first sentence is: "Hello, Sweetie. Again. What are you boys going to do without me?"

<br>

The Doctor stares at the newcomer: "River?"

The figure that looks exactly like their River -- who is still grasped by the Angel -- marches to the sleeky, fleshy, now mouth-gaping man, without a word, punches him in the face and knocks him down clean and quick. The beefy guard receives the same treatment from her left hook fist before he has time to react, falling onto the floor in a loud thump.

River complains, "Oh, I wanted to do that!"

The new River answers with a smile, "You get to do it in ten minutes."

The Doctor understands now. "Vortex Manipulator," then immediately, annoyedly. "You had it the whole time, and you couldn't come back earlier?"

The future River shoots him an unimpressed glare while picking up the sonic screwdriver and beaming their ropes and chains off. "You try to ride a motorbike in traffic like this! I can tear the world apart if I get one second wrong. And don't forget all the new paradoxes it could have created! I wouldn't do it if I didn't know it already happened."

The device on her left wrist blinks and beeps sharply.

She raises her arm and presses the screen stiffly with her right index finger. "I gotta go now."

"That's all? You can't give us anything else?" The Doctor shakes off the now loosened ropes around him, jumping to his feet, reaching to the future River.

"It's only ten minutes into the future, Sweetie, not too much can be done, especially when I was chained up most of the time," the future River rolls her eyes. "But you do want to hurry."

"Speaking of, can't you help sonic me free? I need my hand back," River says loudly, using her free hand to gesture at the Angel that captured her.

"Sorry," the future River turns to herself. She leans in closer, her look turning carefully controlled, voice low to almost like a whisper, "You got all the spoilers from the book. And I'm sorry, it's gonna hurt."

"See you later," she smiles at the Doctor, leaves the sonic screwdriver back where she picked it, and disappears in a quick buzzing sound and lightning sparks similar to the one when she appeared.

"What's gonna hurt?" River asks after her with a raised voice, but she's no longer there to answer.

"Am I always so annoying?" River wonders aloud.

The Doctor chuckles. "Most of the time, yes. That's a clever trick, by the way."

River hums dismissively. "I must have learned it from you. The way you escaped the Pandorica."

The Doctor grins slightly, recalling the same. "That's right."

He walks past Grayle's unconscious body to pick up the sonic screwdriver she left behind, and the book Amy dropped on the floor before she was taken away, looking at the cover thoughtfully.

"She said the spoilers are in the book," Cas says, freeing himself from the loosened ropes and chains, taking them off his neck and body, all the while looking at the same book as the Doctor does. "It must have answers to what's happening to the Angels, and how to save everyone."

"Does that include *saving the Angels*?" The Doctor asks slowly, not looking up.

Cas thinks about it briefly. "If we can, if they're still savable."

"You talk about them like they're alive. You knew they're in pain," River says acutely.

"Like it's your own kind," the Doctor continues, staring at him now.

"You said 'she'," River points out.

The Doctor narrows his eyes, "What are you, really?"

Cas blinks, glancing between them, taken aback. "I told you, I'm an Angel of the Lord."

"And you're sure you don't have any connection to the Weeping Angels?" River says cautiously.

Cas realizes. "You don't trust me."

The Doctor wiggles his eyebrows. "Don't take it personally. I don't trust most people."

River mouths quietly. "That's true."

"You don't seem to have a problem working with me when Dean is here," Cas says, a little uneasy.

"Well, he's not here to endorse you now, is he?" The Doctor notes the obvious. "There is something you didn't tell us, I doubt even he knows, and I wonder why."

"What else do you know about the Angels?" River follows the interrogation closely. "What do you know about *her*?"

Cas glances at the statue again. "She has a name," he finally says.

"What?" The Doctor is surprised.

"Hael. Her name is Hael, I believe." Cas closes his eyes briefly, meeting their eyes again. "We met in Heaven. And I can sense her from the statue. I don't know how or why, and I don't think it *is* her. But there is a connection between the statues and the angels, the fountain in Central Park is Hannah, those two outside are Mirabel and Samandriel, that's all I know. Now, can we talk about saving the humans we care about?"

The Doctor exchanges a questioning look with River.

River shrugs. "Good enough for me."

The Doctor exhales a short breath. "We don't know where they're taken to. You should have asked him before knocking him out."

River looks unregretful. "Sorry about being too eager to take down the bastard. Guess I couldn't wait."

"The book," Cas says glumly. "We have to read it now."

"We can't. It's too dangerous." The Doctor grasps it tight, as if afraid Cas would snap it from him.

"If River is to write the book, she'd make it useful, right?" Cas says thoughtfully.

"I'd certainly try," River answers easily.

"What, you want to find something spoiler-free to read? A page of handy prints? Previews?" The Doctor says skeptically.

"It doesn't matter. The spoilers are already out." Cas suddenly says. "She would know them in ten minutes whether we like it or not. So we can read anything. Pick a random page, and that will be the page we need."

"Closed time loop, I like it," River comments.

The Doctor still hesitates.

"You know he's right," River says encouragingly. "We don't have much time, Doctor. We have to find them quickly before the Angels do. Read it, let's say, Page 43, that's my lucky number. Let's see what it can give us."

The Doctor swallows, opening the book carefully, reading the lines on the page: "If my hand doesn't hurt like it's falling apart, I'd make sure he gets more than a punch. For a second, I want to murder him, but I know the Doctor would never approve. I have to restrain myself. And besides, there are more things I have to worry about now, more things that are hurting so much worse than a broken wrist, everything I wish I didn't know but the Doctor already read it -- where the Angels send them from the cellar, the sacrifices our new friends are going to make, and Amy and Rory's last farewell..."

The Doctor snaps the book shut, his chest heaving and falling violently with each breath. He glares at the cover so fiercely as if his eyes can torch it to ashes. The shock drains the blood from his face. "No! NO!!" he yells, furious and painful. "I can't believe I made this mistake."

"Calm down, Doctor," River tries vainly.

The Doctor strides to her, speaking right to her face. "This is all your fault! I shouldn't have read anything! You get your wrist out without breaking it!"

"How?"

"I don't know! Just do it! Change the future!" His voice is broken, savage and outrageous.

River is taken aback, blinks at her wrist caught at the Angel's grip.

"Come on, angel, they're in the cellar." The Doctor slams out of the room. Cas hurriedly follows.

<br>

The guard who took Dean away stands outside the cellar door. The Doctor raises his sonic screwdriver at him, but Cas is faster. He marches to the man in such fury, a powerful fist is already greeting his face. The man is caught off guard, but he's surprisingly strong enough to take the beating without collapsing. Instead, he draws the gun and shoots within a blink.

The gun shot startles both of them.

Cas lets out a low moan of pain. A fresh gunshot wound shows on his shoulder, blood gushing out. His steps stagger backward by a step, but it doesn't stop him. He hand-chops the gun off the guard's hand, grabbing his arm and pushing him backward forcefully. The guard yells in fury, throwing himself back at Cas.

The Doctor sonics him right that moment, pinning him down. Cas catches the break and gives the guy another punch on the head, which finally knocks him out.

"Amy!" The Doctor shouts at the closed door. Cas tries to pull it open by hand, but the door doesn't give.

"Amy, if you're in there, stay clear!" The Doctor waves Cas to clear the way, beaming the screwdriver at the door. The door shakes under the sonic wave, vibrating violently.

The door is blasted open, and Cas yells, "Dean!"

The two metal plates are knocked down the stairs. Flying dust of iron and wood float in the air, showing stairs leading to a dark space.

"Cas." He hears Dean's voice. Though light, he hears him. His heart leaps just from that voice.

The two of them rush down the stairs. The girl is the first to come into view. The Doctor pulls her into a hug with such joy and relief that Cas can't feel anything but happy for them. But --

"Where is Dean?"

The dark space is empty. For the blink of an eye, Cas swears he saw the face of that familiar human, but the next, as he moves two steps down, there is no one there, as if Dean's face is just a brief hallucination his brain conjured.

Cas raises his voice, "Dean!"

Amy turns around sharply, pointing behind her, "He's right here --"

The horrible truth catches up and her voice is caught in her throat. There is no one behind her, except on the ground, there is a loose bundle of a suit that Cas recognizes without doubt belongs to Dean. Two small statues of cherub tumble on the floor, not moving when they're staring, with an empty space right next to them.

There is a third missing one, one that cursed Dean and sent him away.

"Dean --" Cas stares at the space where Dean should have been, where he saw him for a blink of an eye, where he no longer stands.

His heart bleeds worse than the fresh gun wound on his shoulder.

He lost him, again.

<br>

### Act 2

"I'm sorry." Amy sits down at the bottom of the stairs in the mansion's hallway, too tired, too defeated.

Cas stands next to the banister, quiet. "It's not your fault," he manages to answer.

"Did you see Rory?" The Doctor asks.

Amy shakes her head. "I was hoping you would find him."

"Is he not in the cellar?" The Doctor says. "That man said 'take you two to the babies, like the other one', I thought that other one must mean Rory."

Amy shakes her head again, then stops herself. "He must have been there," she realizes. "There are those burned matches on the floor, even before we were there. He must have been trying to use the matches to light up, and then..." she trails off.

"The babies must have got him, the same way they sent Dean." The Doctor nods miserably.

"Do you think they'll be in the same time and place?" Cas prompts.

"I don't know," the Doctor says. "Let's hope so."

"So is this what's going to happen? We just keep chasing them back in time, and they keep pulling them further back?" Amy winces.

"They're not back in time," River chimes in, walking down the stairs calmly, reading the devices on her left wrist. "I'm reading a displacement, but there is no temporal marker. They've been moved in space, not in time -- not that far from here, by the look of it."

"You got out?" The Doctor watches her, with amazement in his eyes, glittering like stars.

Amy and Cas snap at the same time, "So where are they?!"

River frowns at the screen, squinting and reading, shaking her arm to seemingly urge the device. Her right hand is held at her side.

The Doctor paces up and down the hallway impatiently. "Well? Come on, come on!"

River doesn't spare him a look. "If it were that easy, I'd get you to do it."

"But how did you get your wrist out without breaking it?" The Doctor is still looking at her with wonder, like she's the most amazing thing in the world.

River rolls her eyes. "You asked, I did. Problem?"

"You just changed the future!" The Doctor says, with such awe and appreciation in his voice.

"It's called marriage, honey. Now hush, I'm working." River turns her attention back to the device.

The Doctor sits down at the stairs, still grinning widely, looking just a little dazed, so happy, so hopeful.

"She's good, have you noticed?" he glances at Amy, then Cas. Voice and smile both proud. "Really, really good."

"Actually..." Cas starts slowly, tilting his head at River. He examines River, watching the way her right arm is carefully, stiffly held next to her body; she doesn't even use her right hand to tap on the screen, merely shaking and staring at it. He may not have much grace, but his eyes are still better than average humans, and he can see the fractures in the bones and tendons, the swell that's happening fast, but she manages to keep it all hidden inside her sleeves, acting as if it's nothing. Cas looks at her, wondering why. She reminds him so much of Dean, especially when he would say "I'm fine" when he's clearly not. Humans are always so much more complicated than he can understand.

Cas hesitates, wondering if he should point it out.

River clears her throat loudly. "Ah, whatever it is, it's within a few blocks. There's a car out front -- shall we steal it?"

The Doctor jumps to his feet, running to the door. He grabs her hand in the way.

River moans in pain, snatching it back from him, cradling her wrist closely to her chest, gasping from the pain as she recovers.

Blood drips slowly from her wounded wrist, the one that didn't escape the Angel's grip. It's swelling fast. The joint twisted.

The Doctor stops dead, staring at her hand, then her face. The shock and pain crawl back onto his face. The color is draining from his face as that hopeful look leaves his eyes. Huge pain and sorrow rush in like a wave diving onto the beach, washing out the little sand castles.

Cas swallows as he watches. He can feel it. Just from watching those humans and that Gallifreian, he's feeling so much. The emotions are overwhelming, and he can't make out names for most of them. He wonders if that's how human emotions are; he wonders if that's how Dean feels things.

"Okay, so when all these numbers go to zero, that's when we get a lock, okay? It's how we find Rory." The Doctor is taking off the wrist strap and her device from River, handing them to Amy, explaining the diagrams and numbers on the screen.

Amy fumbles with the devices, taking them over. "Got it."

River sits down on the stairs, trying not to cradle her bad wrist, not to meet the Doctor in the eyes as he walks to her. Her arm lies limply on her lap. Her face is frosty, decidedly stiffen -- not like being caught out, and especially doesn't like being vulnerable.

"Why do you lie to me?" The Doctor gentles his voice, sitting down next to her.

"When one is in love with an ageless god who insists on the face of a twelve-year-old, one does one's best to hide the damage," River says, without looking at him.

Cas blinks, looking away. He shouldn't be here, witnessing them, overhearing them. He understands personal space and intrusion now, thanks to Dean. But he also can't move away.

The words coming out of River surprise him. Up until now, they've been too busy saving the world, saving people, saving Dean; he never really has time to think about much, let alone talking with Dean about... anything that involves feelings. Dean doesn't like talking about feelings, and he understands.

But now that River's words start touching the edge of the topic, the constant question hovering in Cas's mind crawls back up, itching in his head -- the most mysterious and delicate concept in human emotion that he never really understands, the concept of love.

*When one is in love with an ageless god who insists on the face of a twelve-year-old, one does one's best to hide the damage.*

He's not ageless, and he's certainly not a god -- not now, at least. But it might not seem too different to a mortal from existing for eternity and existing for millions of years. And his angelic powers have certainly been mistaken as god, even Dean had once asked, after he was mysteriously resurrected in the Cemetery after Sam jumped into the Cage -- he looked at him from his kneeling position, he looked up with tears in his eyes, and Dean asked, "Cas, are you God?"

That is before he left him for an entire year, and lied in his face for another.

Cas grimaces at the memory. Is that why Dean always hides the damage, the pain, and the suffering? Keeping them only to himself? He was strong, Cas knows that, but not strong enough to carry everything -- the whole world -- on his shoulder. Yet, back then, the angels asked that of him, *he* asked that of him, when they were stopping the Apocalypse. He has hurt him so many times, so badly, since the moment they met, Cas realizes. No wonder Dean would not turn to him when he needs help, when he's in trouble, when he needs someone, anyone, because he was never there for him. He remembers all the time when Sam was hurt, or Bobby, or himself at the brink of death, all Dean would say is "I'm fine" and drink himself to almost alcohol intoxication.

Cas stares at the beautifully lit and decorated interior of the mansion, and all he can see are the shabby motel rooms Dean stayed in, alone in the dark, empty bottles sitting on the bedside stand. He watches him enough times when he's in the sleep like that, and he doesn't realize how much it pains him until now.

"It must hurt," the Doctor says quietly, taking her wounded wrist in his hands, handling it extremely gently and carefully.

River looks away. "Yes," she says. "The wrist is pretty bad too." 

The Doctor just looks at her. And Cas sees -- feels, actually, more than sees -- it pains him. Just like the aching in his own heart now. The feeling of something quietly breaking.

The Doctor leans in, holding River's wrist closer to his lips, and kisses her hand. A bright orange colored light glows from his lips and surrounds her hand, enveloping it like a magic glow.

The regeneration energy. The one thing that the Doctor needs to live that long regenerative life -- it's his life as much as grace is angel's life, and the Doctor is using it to heal the woman he cares.

River gasps loudly. "No! No, stop that, stop that! Stop it!"

He doesn't let go of her hand until the light stops, and the swell and bloodstain around her wrist are all cleared.

"There we go." The Doctor says gently. "How's that?"

River snatches her hand back, trying her fingers. She glares at him. "Well, let's see, shall we?"

She uses that hand to slap him hard across the face.

"Aw!" The Doctor grumbles loudly.

"That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy -- nothing is gained by you being a sentimental idiot," she snaps furiously.

"It's not like I need it anymore," the Doctor defends.

"What?" River turns to him sharply. So does Amy.

"We both know the Time Lords only get twelve regenerations -- twelve chances, twelve lives. I'm running on my last, so this is it." The Doctor says easily.

Amy widens her eyes in horror.

"No!" River says harshly.

"Yes," the Doctor tries to convince her with a small smile. "So might as well make you feel better, don't you think?"

"You... biggest, dumbest fool in the world!" River stutters, springing to her feet, pointing a finger at the Doctor. "We'll figure something out, we'll fix it. But not when you're being a sentimental idiot throwing away your life like it's nothing!"

"River --" The Doctor tries.

"You're unbearable when you do that!" She snaps at him, striding to the front door, and slams out.

"River!" The Doctor calls behind her pointlessly, blinking, glancing around. He runs into Cas's eyes.

"What?" The Doctor says, defensive.

Cas doesn't answer. He's already moving toward the door, following River out.

<br>

River leans outside the door, breathing heavily. The night is getting deeper, the air chilly.

Cas approaches her carefully. "Hey," he asks quietly. "Are you okay?"

River collects herself, shrugging dismissively.

Cas studies her. "Can I ask something personal?"

She flashes him a look, nodding small.

"Why did you lie?" he asks.

River looks at him properly now. "Never let him see the damage. And never ever let him know death or loss is coming close -- he can't handle it. He'll tear the world apart, or it will tear him apart."

Cas makes a small agreeing sound. "I know someone who's also like that," he says.

"It's Dean, isn't it?" River says. Anger is eased from her face and voice.

Cas nods quietly, thinking. "He's only trying to do the right thing, because he loves you."

River huffs a laugh that surprises him. "The Doctor does not and has never loved me. I'm not lying."

Cas stares at her. "I don't understand. You love him."

River smiles bitterly. "Of course I do. But who said he loved me back? He's the Doctor. He doesn't go around falling in love with people. He's not that small or that ordinary. And I'm just fine with that."

Cas finds himself muted.

River continues, "When you love the Doctor, it's like loving the stars themselves. You don't expect a sunset to admire you back. I've always believed, whenever I happen to find myself in danger, the Doctor is not stupid enough, or sentimental enough, and he's certainly not in love enough to be there standing in it with me."

Cas blinks, the pain in her voice jabbing a place in his heart very closely. "That's not what I saw. He cared deeply for you," he tells her. "And the two of you are married, are you not?"

River huffs a laugh again. "That's very complicated. We were in the middle of saving the world, and he's about to sacrifice himself, again -- or rather, I was killing him. And I just, I couldn't let him die without knowing he's loved by so many and so much, and by no one more than me. You see, I was brought up by one reason and one reason only -- I was trained to kill him. All my life, I learn about him, know everything about him -- who else would I fall in love with? But I cannot say it's the same with him."

"How do you know?" Cas asks. "Did you ask?"

"I don't have to, I know." River answers easily. "And I'm fine with it. I live my whole life like that, I don't need him to break my heart every other day like all those other love birds out there."

"Maybe you should have asked," the Doctor chimes in calmly, emerging from behind them. "Then I'll tell you that you are wrong, that nothing should be broken, and the sunset and stars do love back. I checked."

River stares at him unbelievably, wordless.

Cas looks at them, lost in thought.

Amy waves the locating device, telling them. "We got it. They're at a place called Winter Quay. We should go."

They race down the steps before the mansion, leaving the door wide open.

"Don't you need to go back there to save us from that Grayle guy?" The Doctor suddenly remembers.

"Already did," River answers smoothly. "That's before I came downstairs and you acted like a fool."

"I didn't --" The Doctor defends automatically.

"Guys!" Amy stops their bickering in time, pulling open the door of the small car parked before the building. River moves to the driver seat, the Doctor on the other side. Cas eases into the backseat with Amy.

The car runs down the empty, dark street.

The plinth on the opposite side of the street to the mansion where the mother and child statue once stood, is now empty.

Grayle's panicking scream sounds up shortly.

<br>

### Act 3

The car screeches to a halt outside the building.

They scramble out, scanning the building and the surroundings quickly. The red neon sign with its name hanging from the rooftop.

There are no statues in sight. The two bases outside the door are empty. The gate is wide open.

They rush up the steps together.

"Why would they send them here?" River asks. "Why not back in time, like they normally do?"

"The babies might not be strong enough," the Doctor guesses.

"What is this place?" Amy asks, following the rest.

"Let's find out," Cas marches in.

The lobby is dark and dusty, but the dust on the floor has been disturbed recently, leaving visible signs of footmarks and a fight.

Cas glances at the empty stairwell, pressing the button. The rest of them scan around the space that is over quiet, over dead.

"I don't like it," Amy whispers.

"I don't think anyone ever does," River replies.

The elevator clinks to life, descending to their level, the echo sounding too loud for the space, loud enough as if it can stir awake ghosts living here -- that's what this whole place feels like, a building for ghosts, for the dead. Cas thinks, shifting uneasily.

They run into the elevator the minute it opens the barred door, and let it take them wherever fate decides to bring them.

"They're close," River reports, looking at her device.

A voice pierces through his head, as if speaking directly inside his brain. Cas presses his temple, focusing on the sound.

"Cas --" Dean's voice says rapidly through the prayer. "They're here, the angels. The Weeping Angels *are* the actual angels. I saw Tessa, Inias, and Hannah. I think every statue *is* a real angel, the ones went to Purgatory to get you and got wounded, must be Leviathan infection or some mutation. Be careful!"

"What is it?" Amy looks at him.

The elevator rings as it ascends, until it comes to a stop.

"It's a prayer," Cas doesn't have enough time to explain the whole thing, so he wishes they'd just understand. "Dean's praying to me."

The level they stopped at has a long, dimly-lit corridor lying before them, with numerous rooms placed on either side, just like all the other levels they have glimpsed on their way up.

Cas runs down the corridor first.

"Rory!" Amy follows him closely.

"Dean!" Cas yells his name.

The doors all have number plates and names labelled, alphabetically arranged. The first room starts with the last name "Wallace." That's a "W", so does "Williams" and "Winchester."

"Oh, that's bad," River says loudly.

Amy corners into an apartment first, throwing herself into the arms of the man behind the opened door. "Rory!"

Cas notices the room next to them also has an opened door. He rushes in without thinking.

Dean stands in the narrow hallway of the cramped room, looking unsure of himself.

"Dean!" Cas lets out a sharp breath, dragging the hunter into his arms. "I thought I lost you."

Dean pats his back with a relieved smile of his own, "That's a record. I was just praying to you."

"I heard," Cas tells him. "We're already coming to you."

"That elevator is you!" Dean realizes. "Almost gave me a heart attack, thought it was the angels. Did you see them?"

"Not on my way here," Cas says.

Outside, River notices the angel in the alcove, already moving halfway down the corridor. "Doctor, look!"

The angel freezes in their stare, but her hands are lowered from her face, pointing at the opened doors beside them. On her face, a simple, unsettling smile hung on her lips.

"Why is it smiling?" River asks with a shaky voice.

The Doctor follows the direction she points at; only then does he see the names on them. He lunges into Rory's room, grabbing Amy and Rory's shoulders. "Amy, Rory!" he yells, "Get out of there! Don't look at anything! Don't touch anything!"

That's when Amy stares over Rory's shoulder at the single, small bed in the room, asking, "Who's that?"

Next door, Cas is looking at a same cramped, shabby bed, with an old man lying under the cover, who reaches a trembling, withered hand toward him, pleading, "Cas --"

<br>

Cas lets go of Dean, moves to the bed slowly.

The man looks at him without blinking, as if afraid he'd disappear if he does.

"Cas..." he says again from a voice not used in decades, sore and croaked. His hands shake hard, wrinkles and pigment covering his arm. He lowers it to the bed in mere seconds like he doesn't have enough strength to keep them in the air, but still reaches in Cas's direction.

His eyes are foggy with a white layer from old age. The man must be in his nineties. Cas stares at his face, searching his eyes. Dean stands behind him, at the tail of the bed.

Cas lowers himself to the bed. That ancient face is still familiar, still recognizable, still unforgettable. "Dean," he breathes out difficultly, as if for his whole long life, for all the millionth time he calls the man's name, this is the most difficult time he's ever had.

He glances back, at the young Dean behind him, a look of unsure. "He's you," Cas says.

"Cas, please..." the old Dean moans weakly, fingers twitching, but still as if trying desperately to reach Cas, to touch him.

Cas wraps his withered fingers in his hands, holding him.

"Dean, what happened?" Cas asks the old man, voice tight. He swallows hard. He wants to glance back at the young Dean again, to know he's still there, the one he's more familiar with, but he also knows at this moment, he can't look away, he just can't. The old man lying on the bed, so desperately sad, so terribly old, breathing with a loud noise in his chest, with eyes so old and tired to open but still trying desperately to look at him, to hold him, that's also his Dean, the very same Dean. Cas gives him his full attention.

The old Dean pulls an exhausted tiniest smile, and he whispers, "It's... so good... to see you again, Cas."

His fingers slip from Cas's hold, and the lights die in his eyes. His body slumps back into the bed, not moving again.

Cas blinks hard, still holding the hands that are getting stiffer and colder fast. He breathes sharply, reaching out to close his eyes for him. He finds his hands shaking.

"Cas?" The young Dean moves closer to him carefully, putting a hand on his shoulder. Cas reaches to cover his hand with his own, finding himself lacking the courage to look back.

"What's happening?" Dean asks, utterly confused, looking from Cas to the old man on the bed.

Cas swallows hard, then tells him with a deep mourning voice, "I'm sorry, Dean. But you just died."

Next door, they hear Rory's panicking, high-pitched voice, "Will someone please tell me what is going on?"

And the Doctor answers him, painfully, regretfully. "You just died, Rory. I'm so sorry."

I'm not lying. But **whoever said he loved me back? He's the Doctor. He doesn't go around falling in love with people.** And if you think he's anything that small or that ordinary, then you haven't the first idea of what you're dealing with. God knows where he is now but I promise you he's doing whatever the hell he wants and not giving a damn about me. And **I'm just fine with that.** **When you love the Doctor, it's like loving the stars themselves. You don't expect a sunset to admire you back.** And if I happen to find myself in danger, let me tell you, **the Doctor is not stupid enough, or sentimental enough, and he is certainly not in love enough to find himself standing in it with me!**" "Hello, sweetie."

### Act 1

"No, no, that can't be right, 'cause I'm still here, very much alive." Dean paces in the room. Rory nods eagerly beside him.

They all gather in Rory's room now, door closed. River fetched Dean and Cas. Apparently, what they have just witnessed, happened exactly the same to Rory, with Amy by his side, shaken like never before.

"Not for long, you won't," River says the cold truth, glancing at both Dean and Rory. "They'll catch you, and send you back to the very room you are in. For fifty or sixty years, you live and grow old in that room, until you die on that bed. You know it will always happen like that, because you already witnessed it yourself."

Dean swallows, focusing on the existence of Cas next to him, to wipe the image of his old self from behind his eyes. It's so much different from getting caught by an aging curse a few years back.

"Will Amy be there?" Rory prompts.

Dean jerks his head, silently asking the same.

"No," the Doctor answers, breaking their last hope.

"How do you know?" Amy asks sharply.

"Because --" the Doctor breaks off, looking down at his own hands. So sad and so defeated. For a moment, Dean thinks he may never answer again. But he summons the will to speak in the end, "Because he was so pleased to see you again."

The horrible truth smashes onto Dean's face. He can't un-see the face of that old man -- the old man he'd become in fifty, sixty years -- he can tell that unmistakable glint of joy when he caught sight of Cas. That is the same relief and joy every time he's in trouble and he realizes Cas is there for him, with him. He takes a step closer to Cas, rubbing their shoulders together. He needs that solid touch more than ever to know he's not in that dreadful fate yet.

"But Cas can time travel," Dean says, remembering. "He can travel to whenever and pick me up. Right, Cas?" He forces a cheerful voice, knowing it's not that easy before even saying it.

"I won't be able to, if the city is continuously occupied and disturbed by the angels like this, the time flux would be impossible to fly through," Cas answers miserably.

"You already saw what that first trip did to him, you're asking him to do it again?" The Doctor looks at Dean.

Dean lowers his head, knowing he's right. "It will kill him." He understands.

"Why are they all over us?" Amy asks, the same question in all their minds without an answer. "Why Rory? Why Dean? What did they do?"

"Bad luck?" River offers. "They need food, and any living human is just a food source for them."

The Doctor fills in for her. "It's like a huge energy farm for them. Displacing someone back in time creates time energy, and that's what the Angels feed on. But normally it's a one-off -- a hit and run. If they could keep hold of their victims, feed off their time energy over and over again... They'd never worry about running out of food again."

He looks up at River. "How many Angels in New York?"

River glances at the window. They can see the night sky and the neighboring skyscrapers from there. She answers, "It's like they've taken over every statue in the city."

"The Angels take Manhattan!" The Doctor sighs, defeated. "Because they can, because they've never had a food source like this one before. So many statues, so many people. In a city that never sleeps. It's a buffet."

"Or maybe not," Cas cuts in suddenly. The rest of them turn to him. He continues, "Maybe they're not to harm them, but to ask for help, to reach out for touch, because angels have an instinct to heal by touching. Or they're too lonely, so they want to keep those humans for company."

Amy stares at him, "Are we still talking about the Weeping Angels? Or the Angel of the Lord species?"

Dean jumps in. "We have a theory, they might just be the same thing." He explains quickly about the Purgatory rescue and the patterns they've been noticing, the names of the angels they recognized from the statues.

"Purgatory infection," River repeats slowly, eyeing Cas, who nods solemnly.

"We're not sure. It's a working theory." Dean patches. "An infection, a mutation, a disease, something like that."

"Then why aren't you infected? Why aren't you a statue?" The Doctor looks at Cas.

Cas thinks about it. "I'm not wounded by them. Or touched by other angels, I guess."

"Thankfully," Dean adds, curling his lips a tiny little bit.

"But you said you only came back about a week ago," Amy asks. "But we've been running into the Weeping Angels for ages. It's all over the timeline." She meets eyes with River and the Doctor, "Like that time when we were in Byzantium, that's the 51st century."

"And I ran into them in 1969, too." The Doctor supplies.

Cas tilts his head to consider. "Because of the time travel," he answers. "As soon as they exist at one point on the timeline, they spread across the whole timeline all at once. That's why you said no one knows where they come from, because they can be in all the time. Chronologically, they didn't exist until a week ago."

"Like our ground zero," Dean says.

"And ever since then, they spread across the whole time flux, infecting more statues, more angels, and running further backward and forward," River nods. "It makes sense."

"How does that help us fix the problem?" Amy asks quickly. "More importantly, how do we keep Rory safe?"

Dean raises his hand, "And me."

Outside the window, they hear a loud crashing sound in the distance. The floor shakes beneath them.

"What was that?" Rory panics.

"I don't know. But I think they're coming for you." The Doctor glances at the window. The city light shakes as the crash echoes, blinking dangerously. The forever bright night skyline of Manhattan falls dark briefly, then comes back up.

"What if we run?" Dean asks, thinking it seems to be an obvious solution. "They haven't got us yet. What if we just get the hell out of here and never get captured?"

"Then that would never happen, right?" Rory points at his own dead body on the bed, asking the group with hope in his eyes. Dean admires his courage to even look at his own dead body a second time.

"But it already happened -- it's destined to happen. You know it will come sooner or later. You can't run for your whole life." The Doctor says, in a pained voice.

"Doctor, they're right," River prompts.

"No, they aren't."

The loud thumping noise comes again outside, and it sounds getting closer. The floor shakes again. The light of the whole city shakes again.

Amy shrieks, "What is that?!"

River says quickly, "If they get out, if they die anywhere else, it creates a paradox. This is the Angel's food source -- paradox poisons the well. It could kill all of them. This place would literally unhappen."

"It would be almost impossible." The Doctor argues.

"Love the 'almost'," Dean says immediately.

The Doctor says rapidly, "But to create a paradox like that, big enough to clean up a whole city, possibly a whole world, it takes almost unimaginable power. What have we got? Come on, tell me, what?"

A short silence.

Amy reaches to grab Rory's hand, standing right next to him, holding him tightly. She looks at them, unfearful and determined. "I won't let them take him. That's what we got."

Dean quickly glances at Cas, running right into his eyes, realizing Cas is looking at him in exactly the way Amy looks at Rory. He swallows hard, wetting his dry lips. His heart pounds hard in his chest. He remembers every single word he talked with Amy and Rory earlier that night; he just hopes he can have one damn minute to talk to Cas about it.

"You'll do the same, right, Cas?" He hears his voice ask hoarsely, desperate to make it sound like a joke.

"Of course, Dean," Cas answers instantly. "I won't let them take you."

That massive crashing voice outside the window hits again. Now, not only does the floor feel like shaking, but the whole wall and building are shaking with it. It's like the damn thing is quaking the earth.

"Whatever that thing is, it sounds like it's getting closer," Rory says, clenching their hands tighter.

The Doctor looks at him, then Dean. "Even if you two managed to get out tonight, you'd have to keep running for the rest of your life. They would be chasing you forever until you die."

"That's pretty much my job description," Dean answers flatly.

"Well then, better get started." Amy lets out a breath, almost relieved, now that they sort of have a plan.

She goes to the apartment door, throws it open -- an Angel is there, Tessa is frozen in her feral attacking position. Her hands are raised high above her head, long claws extending from the ends of her fingernails. Amy stares at her without blinking, yelling back, "Husband -- run!"

Rory ducks into the opening under the statue, dashing outside.

Amy races out with him.

"River, I'm not sure this can work..." The Doctor tries again.

River fixes him with a look, "Husband -- shut up!"

The two of them sprint to the hallway.

Dean glances at Cas quickly, feeling his cheek burning at the imagined yell with a similar term. He clears his throat loudly. But Cas only yells, "Dean -- go! I got them!"

Dean ducks past the frozen angel, running to the hallway.

The dim lamp overhead shakes violently, blinking on and off. Two angels are cornering them from both sides, Inias from the direction of the elevator, Hannah from the alcove. They still have Tessa at the apartment door. The other four must have found the stairs and left the hallway. It's only the two of them against three angels with a dying lamp.

Dean stares at the statue of Inias and Hannah, and every time he shifts his gaze from one to the other, the unnoticed one moves closer in the blink.

"Cas -- we need to figure out something quick! I don't have enough eyes!" he yells.

"I do!" Cas answers.

"And we're running out of light!" Dean shouts, squinting at the light that is getting dimmer by each flash, until with a pop, it breaks completely. He can hear glass shattering from the bulb.

At the same moment when the corridor is covered in almost darkness, a new light source starts, warm and bright, steady, silvery blue, coming from Cas's direction.

Dean swirls on his heel, staring at Cas. The view catches his breath.

Cas is lighting up. Grace shines from his eyes and his body, his wings spreading from behind him. But instead of the shadow of the wings that he caught a glimpse of all those years ago when they first met, this time, they are the real wings made of light. It's not burning bright, so even if it's still slightly too bright to look at for long, he can see it without burning his eyes. The wings are directly made of light, but they also look soft, feathery even, though he's sure if he touches them, they would not feel fluffy. And the most astonishing thing is, the wings are covered by eyes. Big and small, blinking and staring, they look in all directions, guarding their back, their side, monitoring all the danger that can possibly approach them.

Dean finds his tongue caught, his throat tight. His voice is completely choked in his throat. It's beautiful beyond human language. Cas is beautiful. And for the first time in many years, more than ever, he realizes -- Cas is an angel.

"Go!" Cas opens his mouth, and even his mouth is filled with light. "I got them. Go to the stairs! I'm right behind you."

Dean blinks fast, shifting his eyes, squeezing the tears off the corner of his eyes triggered by the light and the view. The corridor is lit enough that none of the statues can move an inch. He finds the door leading to the stairs and pushes it open.

He can feel Cas move right behind him, as the light and the shadow of it move together with him.

The angels already occupy the lower stories. With a glance, he can tell there is no way they can run down those fifty or sixty floors safely, even with Cas. And no way the other four headed down.

He races up toward the rooftop.

Dean thinks he has never climbed the stairs faster than today in his entire life.

Two minutes later, he's already reaching the top floor, bursting through the door to the rooftop, and Cas follows right after.

Amy and Rory hold hand in hands near the edge of the roof, staring at something huge and tall behind them. River and the Doctor are staring at Cas.

"Holy!" River exclaims. "You really are an angel!"

Dean can't help grinning a little, too proud, chest too full. "That's the second time of the day I heard people say that about him. Isn't he amazing?"

But further down from where they can't see, the sound of stones moving through the stairs is loud and clear. Dean pushes the door closed, and the Doctor gives him a hand to shut it tight.

They back away from the door toward the edge of the rooftop. There is no way down now.

Amy and Rory are still staring at the thing over their heads behind the building with their mouths open in disbelief.

Dean has a bad feeling but he forces himself to turn around and look up. There, feral and fangs out, stands the Statue of Liberty, in an attacking pose. Only to be frozen under their gaze.

Dean lets out a harsh breath, hearing his mouth say: "Always wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty. I guess she got impatient."

And next to him, another gasp comes from Cas. He says, astounded: "That's Naomi."

<br>

### Act 2

A loud pounding on the closed door. The door shakes, looking like it's not going to hold for much longer.

The light from Cas dims rapidly. His wings slump down, almost drooping completely to the ground. The color in his eyes waned to no more than a glint that's barely there. The eyes on his wings blink sluggishly. Cas drops to his knees, not having enough strength to even hold his body straight. It's exhausting him fast.

Dean rushes to lend him a shoulder, having his arm around Cas's shoulder and waist.

"Turn that off, Cas! It's burning you up!" Dean yells at him, shaking him a little.

Cas closes his eyes tiredly. His wings disappear, so do the eyes and light. The rooftop suddenly looks as dark as the night. They realize the power of the whole city has been cut. The city that never sleeps has become the city of darkness.

"I'm sorry," Cas staggers when he tries to stand still by himself, his voice hoarse and dry, like sandpaper rubbing. Dean can smell a taste of bloody iron just being this close to him. How many new wounds has Cas added to himself just by lighting himself up? Burning away some internal organs without him knowing, maybe?

"Stop burning yourself up!" Dean snaps, and Cas winces. Dean immediately gentles his voice. "I mean you did great, but I need you alive, you hear me? Still need you to fly us home, remember?"

Cas gives him a tired, apologetic look. Dean can feel the gaze from the Doctor and River. All saying the same thing -- they are probably not going to go back now.

"No, there must be a way," Dean thinks aloud.

"The paradox," Rory meets his eyes, walking cautiously toward the edge of the rooftop.

"What are you doing?" The Doctor raises his voice alarmingly.

"Rory?" Amy queries.

"Keep your eyes on the Statue!" Rory glances down, and Dean watches him closely.

"Is there a way down?" Amy asks without looking back.

"Uh, no," Rory answers hesitantly.

"But there's a way out," Dean says for him.

Rory clearly walks toward the low wall skirting the edge of the building, ready to climb up.

Amy turns around sharply, tears in her eyes. "Rory, what are you doing? Stop it! You'll die."

"Yeah, exactly." Rory smiles shakily. "Twice in the same building on the same night. Who else could do that?"

Dean lets go of Cas, walks carefully toward him, holding out a hand to grab him at the edge of his shirt. "Actually, I can."

"Stop it, both of you!" The Doctor yells.

"Dean!" cries Cas.

Rory meets Dean's eyes, then turns back to Amy. "This is the right thing to do. This will work. If I die now -- " Dean cuts him off by "if one of us dies now", Rory continues, "-- it's a paradox, right? The paradox kills the angels. River said so. Tell me I'm wrong, please, 'cause I'm really scared."

Amy stands before him, holding his hand. "Stop it! Just stop it!"

Dean adds a little more force to the grip he has on this brave man, and it makes his head clearer than ever. "Come down here, Rory. I should be the one jumping down."

"Dean, no!" Cas yells desperately.

Dean turns around to face Cas, who stands just a step away from him now, looking at him, devastated.

"It's okay, Cas." Dean finds his heart suddenly so light and bloated. It feels easy. It feels the right thing to do. "This will work, this will kill the infected angels."

"It will kill you too!" Cas snaps.

"Will it?" Dean glances over his head. "They said this place would be erased from time, never exist. Angels are never infected. If this place never existed, what did I fall off?"

"You think you'll just come back to life?" Cas's lips tremble. Dean realizes that's exactly where his stare has always landed, focused on, longed about.

"When don't I?" He smiles easily.

"Dean --"

"And compare to the other life? Living downstairs, dying of old age, never seeing you again? What life is that? I've never imagined a long life anyway. Swinging out in a glory, Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid style, that's exactly what I've been imagining anyway."

"Maybe there are other ways! You don't have to!" Cas says, voice choking.

"I want to," Dean tells him, gentler now. "It can save you, too."

"Save me?"

"That's the bad witch right there, right?" He glances at the Statue of Liberty. "That angel Naomi? Chasing you around, hurting you? Don't you think it's about time to kick her ass?"

Cas's eyes glint with tears. His hands reach out to hold Dean's, grabbing him tight. And he says, "I won't let you die. I can't."

Dean is almost amused. "I don't think I need your permission."

Right then, the ground shakes again. The whole building shakes. When none of them are looking, behind them, a huge shadow of a large claw falls toward them, unmistakably aiming at Rory and Dean.

Amy shouts, while Dean tries so hard to snatch his hand out of Cas's grip. He's still two steps away from the edge of the building -- too far to cross in the blink of an eye, if they blinked. And the angel is too fast.

As fast as any other angel, Cas takes action. An outrageous roar comes out of him, and his wings spread out from his shoulder blades again, wide and vast, covering the humans on the rooftop like a protective shield.

Before Dean can register what has happened, the touch of Naomi lands on Cas's wings.

He knows it from the way Cas's whole body stiffens. He looks at Dean in a horrified look, and his wings start turning into stone before his eyes.

"NO --!" Dean yells desperately. "No, no, no, no, no -- this is not happening! Cas!"

The tip of that beautiful, soft-looking wing turns into marble, extending fast across the feathers, freezing him in place. Dean stares at him, and Cas can't move an inch.

Dean reaches a hand to him intuitively.

"Don't touch him!" the Doctor yells behind him. "He's a Weeping Angel now! He can send you anywhere!"

"I don't care! He's Cas!" Dean growls back, taking back his hands, cupping Cas's face, where the stone hasn't reached yet, where the skin is still soft and warm, still in a human body. He wonders why he's never done this before.

Cas blinks tiredly at him, saying in a low voice. "He's right, Dean. I'm infected now, I could harm you. You shouldn't touch me."

"When could you ever hurt me?" Dean smiles back, almost chuckling, almost teary. "Remember that time when Heaven took you back? The first day you came back, you said 'You serve Heaven, you don't serve man, certainly not me,' and the next thing you did, you helped me."

A mirroring smile shows up on the tips of Cas's lips. "I don't know you remembered."

"Of course I do," Dean says gently, too soft, too choked. He swallows rapidly. "I remember everything about you."

"That time, that's Naomi too," Cas tells him. "She took me back, 'fixed' me, so that I could remember my priority is to save the angels, not the humans."

Dean scoffs. "Looks to me she's the one needs fixing."

The texture of stone covers Cas's body fast, from his feet to his hands, crawling up his neck toward his head next. Cas can't move at all except for blinking and holding a tight smile.

Cas chuckles quietly. "There is something I want to tell you, Dean. But I think we're running out of time."

Tears fall down on Dean's cheek. "I'll save you, Cas. You're not dead, I'll find a way and I'll fix you. I promise."

Cas looks him in the eyes, and answers gently, "Goodbye, Dean."

Right then, the stone covers his whole face, freezing his blue eyes into cold marble color.

Dean can't help but let out a loud cry of pain. "CAS!" His heart clenches so hard he can't breathe.

The statue that was once Castiel doesn't move an inch, and doesn't answer.

"Keep staring at him! Don't blink!" The Doctor yells behind them.

Dean wipes the tears away frantically.

There is no easier thing in the world than staring at Cas anyway. So he stares.

<br>

~~Amy: "Husband, run!" River: "Husband, shut up!" Dean: (swallow) others: (amused, glimpse at Dean/Cas) Dean: (blush)~~

(Liberty is Naomi)

Cas buy them time by using all his eyes in his true form to stare at all sculptures all at once so none of them can move again, so the sacrifice is he can't move either (not a solution, so give up)

Dean has to stare at Cas too when Cas is weeping angel. Not blinking, stare save the day

Cas is a "good" weeping angel with them (same as when with normal asshole angels) → deliberately turn off the light and/or close their eyes, and let Cas be free and move, Doctor/etc. freak out, Cas take care of other bad angels, Dean win the bet because he has faith (BAMF Cas)

### Act 1

The loud pounding of stone on the service door continues. And with a final push, the door flies. The angels march toward them fast whenever they blink or look away. There are too many of them.

"No way we can stare at all of them at the same time, Doctor!" River cries.

The Doctor aims his sonic screwdriver at one of them and sends it flying. But the next one is already in its place before he steadies his step. They spread out, making it even more difficult to keep an eye on everyone of them.

"Okay, I'm going, that's the only way." Rory starts climbing up the low wall at the edge again.

"No, wait! There is another, if you trust me. If all of you trust me, and I trust Cas," Dean says loudly, looking away from Cas.

"What are you talking about?" River shouts back at him.

"Have a little faith. And don't look at Cas for a second, that's all I ask," Dean smiles a little. It's a bet, but it's on Cas. He's willing to bet the world on Cas at any time. So why not this time, too?

"You are asking us to trust a Weeping Angel?" The Doctor glances at him unbelievably.

"I'm asking you to trust someone who's kind enough to help find your friend when we didn't have to, to fly all of you to 1938 when none of you can, to risk getting turned into a statue to protect me and your friend there, who's willing to sacrifice himself to save the world without blinking. I'm asking you to have a little faith in Cas, that even infected, he's on our side," Dean tells them firmly, pleadingly.

"Okay," Amy says, turning to the other side. So does Rory.

"I trust him," River follows quickly.

The Doctor sighs. "Do I have a choice?"

The statue of Cas disappears immediately.

Dean prays quietly. *Come back to me. Save the world, and come back to me. Let me save you, too.*

They blink. Half the besieging angels disappear from the rooftop.

They blink again. The remaining ones are also cleared out.

"Where did they go?" Amy asks loudly.

"He must have sent them away," River answers, amazed. "You can send people away, which means you can send anything away. And he's sending the other angels away."

"What about that big one?" Dean points at the Statue of Liberty -- at the bastard angel named Naomi.

"No reason he can't. The size shouldn't matter," the Doctor answers him.

Between one second and the next, the space that was occupied by the gigantic statue is wiped clean. So hollow and empty that Dean feels as if the chunk of space has been swallowed.

"People waking up tomorrow are gonna ask where the Lady Liberty goes," Dean jokes.

"At least there *are* still people waking up tomorrow," River answers.

Dean hums an agreement.

And then, Cas comes back.

Still statue, still with wings, though now tugged behind his back. His hands cover his face, as if he's weeping. The perfect image of a Weeping Angel.

Dean stares at him, regarding his shape. He's not broken or hurt, and his trench coat and suits look just like a natural intrinsic part of him. His hair is ruffled as it used to be. He might be a statue, but he looks just like when he's alive. And it makes looking at him even more painful.

The Doctor points his sonic screwdriver at him.

Dean jumps in front of Cas, facing the Doctor furiously with his arms open around Cas in a protective gesture. "He just saved all of us! Don't you dare hurt him!"

The Doctor blinks at him, then realizes. "What? No, of course I'm not hurting him. I was trying to link all the temporal energy he collected from sending other angels away to give Tardis a parking light. To get our flight ticket."

"We can all go back to 2012 now?" Dean asks dumbly.

"If you want." The Doctor answers plainly. "Since the situation is solved, more or less. I don't want to stay here another minute."

"'More or less'?" Dean parrots. "What does that mean? Will they come back?"

The Doctor says, "Technically, they still can, but if Castiel stays here, he can send them back again. Probably should call him Guardian Angel of Manhattan now."

Dean squints at him. "But what about Cas?"

"What about him?"

"Will he ever come back normal? Un-stoned?"

The Doctor looks down, voice quiet. "I'm sorry."

Dean says, "No."

The Doctor glances at him, "What do you mean, 'no'?"

"I mean -- NO. If this is the reality, I don't want it." He throws a quick look at Amy. "You taught me that. I'm going to bring him back."

The Doctor starts: "I know it's difficult to lose someone..."

Dean cuts him off harshly, "No, you don't! I'm not going to leave him again, not ever! We come here together, we go home together. I'm not leaving him in this bloody thirties New York like this. Paradox or whatever it takes, I'll do it. Whether you like it or not."

"I was trying to save you!" The Doctor defends.

"And I am trying to save him!" Dean says firmly. "We are here because we want to help you, so now, help me save him."

"You'll kill yourself," the Doctor says simply.

"Fine," Dean moves up the low wall at the edge of the building quickly, without hesitation.

"You weren't going to kill yourself for saving the world, but you'd do it to save him?" River says.

Dean thinks about it, realizing that's true. He shrugs. "He means more than the world to me."

"You should let him know," River says gently. "He would love to know."

Dean actually smiles. "Next time when I get the chance, I will."

"Maybe I should do it," Rory says suddenly. "Then you can have that chance."

"Rory!" Amy objects loudly.

"No," Dean says firmly, turning to him. "Thank you for offering, but no. You have each other; I have no one now. Besides, we don't even really know if it would work. If it doesn't, try something else for me, please, save him. And, oh --" he takes out his phone, tossing it to Rory, "-- maybe let my brother know, too. Tell him I'm sorry."

He stands straight on the wall. The whole of New York feels at his feet. The night wind flows around the skirt of his shirt. The Chrysler Building stands silently behind him under the night sky.

"Cas --" Dean says, looking at the statue of Castiel, and closing his eyes deliberately, thinking hard. "Thank you for everything you did for me. This time, let me do this one thing for you."

He opens his eyes. Cas has moved to him, the stone wings are frozen in a spreading pose, his hands reaching out, opening like a hug, marks of tears frozen on his face. But he's careful enough not to touch him.

The only Weeping Angel that is actually weeping, is because Cas is crying for him.

Dean leans in, kissing the cold stone of Cas on the forehead, and he says with a small smile, "Goodbye, Cas."

A breath. A step. He topples over the edge.

For a horrifying second, there is only silence. Then, screams from below, screeches of Cars braking and swerving, horns blaring.

Amy covers her mouth, eyes shut in unbearable horror. Rory pulls her into his embrace.

"Oh God!" River yells breathlessly.

The stone statue of Cas cracks before their eyes, starting from the chest where the heart is. The crack extends over his body and his wings. And with an explosion sound, the statue that forms Cas breaks apart into rocks.

That is when lightning flashes through the air, surges of energy pulsing around the place, light glowing blindingly brighter, the whole building starts shaking.

"What's happening?" River shouts over the sound of electricity cracking.

"The paradox!" The Doctor is grinning, wild with ecstasy. "The paradox is working!"

### Act 1

Dean wakes up with a light moan of a headache.

The light from the sky is too bright. The stone underneath him is too cold and rigid.

He sits up, realizing he's in a graveyard, with his recent four new companions waking up slowly near him. He would have thought they are some dream too vivid with too much imagination. Amy and Rory are hugging in relief.

"Where are we?" he asks.

The Doctor beams at him. "Back where we started, 2012. You collapsed the timeline, the paradox worked. And we all get thrown back where we belong."

"The angels?" Dean says, stumbling up, looking around.

There are still statues near some tombs, looking peaceful and tranquil, beautiful and solemn. Some of them are shaped like angels, others just human figures without wings.

"These are just normal statues," the Doctor follows his gaze. "I tested. Sonic-ed and blinked, they are just normal statues. I think all the Weeping Angels, sorry, the infected angels of the Lord, are wiped clean."

"Does that mean cured or killed?" Dean is suddenly tense.

The Doctor falls quiet for a second. "I don't know about that. Sorry."

"And Cas?"

The Doctor shakes his head mutedly. "Didn't see him since waking up."

"No." Dean breathes heavily. "I did that specifically to save him, you can't tell me he doesn't get a second chance."

He shakes his head, refusing to accept the reality.

There is a statue standing guard at the entrance of the graveyard. The figure looks tall and stiff from the back, with wings held out in a relaxing position, but he can't see it clearly enough from this distance.

He squints, and he blinks.

The statue disappears from its position. Dean jumps, and some device of the Doctor's or River's starts beeping.

"Survivors!" River is alarmed. All of them shift from post-battle celebration mode to battle-ready mode.

They look around, eyes sharp.

And then Dean sees him. The final remaining Weeping Angel. His angel that was weeping. The statue moves close to him at a safe distance, close enough for him to see, but not close enough to touch. Dean doesn't think; he dashes to him, ignoring the shouting of warning of the others.

"Cas!" Dean runs until he's right in front of him.

There are fissures all over his skin -- the surface of his stony form, to be exact. His eyes are filled with tears of sorrow, and even if there is no color in the stone, Dean can tell the blue in it. The sea of bitterness and desperation. The sea of pain and loss.

That is the moment Dean realizes, this time, when he jumped, Cas was the one having to watch him die and not able to save him.

He swallows hard, touching his cheek, the corners of his lips, and the marks of tears. He wants desperately to wipe those tears from his face.

"I'm sorry." Dean murmurs, pressing his forehead with Cas. "Please tell me how to save you."

"He's a survivor," the Doctor says behind him quietly. "Must be because he's in the center of that timeline explosion."

"Doesn't look like a survivor to me if he's still a statue," Dean answers, without opening his eyes, without taking his hand away from the statue.

"What should I do? Another paradox to fix him?" Dean asks desperately.

"That could rip the earth apart." The Doctor warns.

"The Earth." Dean actually laughs. "I save the Earth enough times, about time it saves us for once for a change."

A blink.

Cas moves. His hand raises up, reaching to Dean, as if he wants to touch Dean, but he remembers what he is at the last moment, and he has to restrain himself to stay away, stay far.

Dean puts his hand on it.

"Don't!" The Doctor blurts out.

"I don't care," Dean cuts him off, already knowing what he'll hear. "If he sends me back, then we go back together. Wherever he goes, I go."

He shuts his eyes tightly, painfully, letting the tears overflow. "Cas, I don't know if you can hear me," he says, praying before he realizes that's what he's doing, "but if you are in there somewhere, come back to me, please. Because --" his voice chokes, he swallows hard. Words fail him. Instead, Dean leans, pressing his lips on the statue of Cas, letting his tears wet the stone. He tastes the salty flavor of the stone and his tears.

That is when he starts feeling Cas start stirring, softening. The head is first to come back, as it was the last to turn to the storm. His eyes blink dazedly. And Dean doesn't stop as the lips beneath the touch turn soft, flesh, real. Cas kisses him back with a low, quiet moan, "Dean."

He waits until the whole of Cas turns back to normal to stop. Pull apart half a step, just to study him carefully, top to bottom, just to make sure he's really alright this time. The tear marks linger on his face, and he wipes them with the back of a hand.

Dean watches with so much joy that the ability to speak escapes him.

Cas makes a small shivering move, and the wings disappear from his back.

Dean frowns, pouting, "I liked them."

Cas looks at him in the eyes, the remnant of pain and desperation swirling in his blue eyes. Dean swallows. And Cas says, too gently, too terrified, "Please don't do that again."

And Dean answers with a choked, "Same goes to you."

Cas pulls him back into a hug so warm and tight that Dean never wants to break again. Every inch of skin is so soft and gentle under his touch; he would never imagine he would miss the touch of flesh so much. He rests his cheek on Cas's shoulder and leans his head on Cas's, thinking this is how he'll spend eternity.

But he forces himself to pull back again. "Listen," Dean says, heart pounding fast as those dazzling blue eyes staring right back at him. "There's something I should have said, before those things happened, before anything happens again." He glances at the other people, watching Amy and Rory bumping shoulders now, the Doctor and River wiping the exterior of the Tardis together. He wets his lips. Cas waits patiently.

And Dean tells him, "I can't let you die without knowing you are loved, by so many and so much. And by no one more than me."

Cas gasps quietly, eyes widening, blinking fast.

Unsure and shaky, Cas whispers, "You love me?"

And Dean starts smiling, ever so gently. "That's what I said."

Cas breathes out, biting his lips, and then, hoarsely, honestly, "I should have let you know the same thing."

And Dean answers, "I already do."

They pull each other in again, closing the gap between their bodies and their lips -- any gap feels too wide and too empty now, neither of them can bear.

<br>

"Look who finally decides to join," River jokes as they walk back to the group. Tardis looks fresh and new, showing no sign of charred, burning marks from the explosion, even the light bulb on top of the machine spins cheerfully and brightly.

"I see someone has finally figured *something* out," Amy says, eyeing their shared grins and holding hands.

Dean blushes slightly. "Thanks to you," he says half-jokingly.

"You're welcome," Amy takes the credit gladly.

"What now?" Rory hangs around, hands in his pockets. "I'm thinking some pub."

"I want to go to the pub right now!" The Doctor answers immediately. "Are there video games? I love video games!"

"We are so gonna hang out together." Dean agrees.

"I thought that's going to be their family trip, the Ponds and the Doctors." Cas points out.

Dean pauses his step. "Is it? Well, we can always go by ourselves. I want the burger from Josie's again."

Amy laughs warmly. "You are more than welcome to join. Except, Doctor -- there's something you might want to know."

The tone in her voice freezes the smile on the Doctor's face. "What is it?"

Amy holds Rory's hand tight, and says, "Rory and I had a discussion, you know, after we almost died, or actually he really did." They exchange a nervous look. Rory says quietly, "Even if we're not dead, we could have stuck there, never able to go back home. And... my Dad is going to miss me."

"You're resigning?" The Doctor says slowly, understanding, but not easily.

"We're going home," Amy corrects him, a shaky smile. "We're not giving you up, if that's what you're thinking."

"You can still come for dinner," Rory says, a tight smile. "And know we'll always set a seat for you at Christmas. You, too, Melody."

He reaches out a hand toward River, and River takes it. Her other hand in Amy's.

The Doctor blinks slowly, shakily, but not sad. Then, realization hits him. "We are still fulfilling the book."

"What did the book say?" Amy asks.

"Their big sacrifices," the Doctor nods at Dean and Cas, turning back to Amy. "And your farewell. I thought -- I thought..." He takes a shaky breath, starts laughing hysterically.

Amy catches on quickly, smiling too. "Don't worry, Raggedy Man," she says. "It's not a 'farewell', just a 'see you around'."

The Doctor says, beyond joy, "Let's go home."

Rory turns to Dean and Cas, "What about you?"

Dean shrugs, "Same old, just wandering around, working my job, I guess."

"You have anyone waiting for you to come home?" Rory asks seriously. "My Dad is watering plants for us."

"Not really." Dean glances at Cas. "I got him, I got a car, that's about it."

Cas says slowly, "That's not true."

Dean raises his eyebrows.

Cas says quietly, "You have a brother, and possibly soon a sister-in-law, who might have a house and that's a family."

Dean swallows, turning to Rory, "What he said."

"That reminds me," Rory fumbles in his pocket, fishing out his phone and giving it back to Dean. He adds hastily, "Probably none of my business, but I think you should give your brother a call or something, not just let a stranger tell him after you're dead. He'd hate that."

Dean struggles with the words fighting on his tongue. He wants to bite them back, but in this man's honest eyes, he finds it easy to let them out. So he confesses frankly, "He'd never be truly happy if I were alive. He'd never live the life he wanted if I'm alive. Now I can't really damn myself, so this is probably the second best thing I can give him."

Rory glares at him, almost furiously, which is the first time since Dean met him. "You dumb thing," he snaps. "Do you really think he'd ever be truly happy again when he believes you're dead?"

Dean falls quiet.

Cas adds, "I wanted to tell you the same."

Dean nods silently, then, "Alright, we'll pay him a visit then, and a big, happy family dinner after."

Rory nods approvingly. "That's more like it."

"You really sound like a dad now," Dean can't help but comment.

River chimes in, "Technically, he *is* my Dad."

Rory laughs slightly, moving into the Tardis. So do Amy and River.

"You want a ride?" The Doctor leans against the door of the Tardis.

Dean gives the blue phone box another once-over, knowing well enough now even though it looks nothing like a spaceship or a time machine from the outside, it's bigger on the inside. With his luck, it's probably going to be his only time riding in something like that. But --

Dean gives him a shake of the head. "My Baby is parked out of Central Park. Don't want to leave her behind."

The Doctor gives him an understandable nod, and a handshake for farewell.

"I'll probably see *you* again," he turns to Cas. "Somewhere in the universe, some time in the past or future."

Cas nods gently, "I'll look forward to that, Doctor."

The Tardis takes off shortly.

Dean takes Cas's hand, holding it naturally, as if he's done that a million times, as if he knows his hand belongs there. And he says, "I'm starving. Let's go to that amazing burger place first. I'll have large fries this time for all those pigeons. And we can call Sam after. What do you say, Angel?"

Cas smiles like the sun shines on him for the first time, like the most beautiful being is standing before him, speaking the most beautiful language. He braids their fingers, and answers, "I'd like that, very much."

They walk onto the street of Manhattan together, heading north. The warmth of the sun pours onto their face.

Dean takes a long inhale, breathing in the smell of the busiest city. Normal, ordinary people walk past them on the pedestrians, jostling their shoulders in the busy streets.

Dean looks up at the skyscrapers and all those towering buildings around them, thinking for the first time, he might actually start to like Manhattan.

### references

Brian looks to the Doctor, so serious: "What happened to the other people who travel with you?" Doctor: "Some left me. Some got left behind. And some... not many but... some died.  (off Brian's horrified look) Not them. Not them, Brian. Never them." ending: Doctor: "I know. You both have lives here. Beautiful, messy lives. This is what makes you so fabulously human. You don't want to give them up. I understand." Brian: "Actually, it's you they can't give up, Doctor. And I don't think they should. Go with him. Go save every world you can find. Who else has that chance? Life'll still be here." Doctor: "You could come, Brian." Brian: "Somebody has to water the plants. Just... bring them back safe." (S07E04) (Doctor: "You could bring the plants too, come on, Brian. Tardis needs you." Rory whisper: "He means he needs us, and we need you." Brian: "I'll go packing then.")

## Afterword

> (use as epilogue, letter format?, like Amy's letter to the Doctor from the past)
>
> some possible follow-ups (with some time jump? timestamp short scenes): Brian/Rory/Amy dinner, Rory/Amy/Doctor/River Christmas, Doctor/Cas meet in time flux maybe even for help, Sam/Dean/Cas reunite & intro to Sam's new life, surprise: Amy/Charlie meet

### draft notes

about Sam: Dean/Sam reunite; follow-up conversation about normal life vs adventure, talking about "the other life" and maybe the truth is not about whereto but runaway, make Dean think Sam → lead to: understand/call Sam, Dean realize he's angry/jealous/unfair to Sam (extend a bit more to show Dean/Cas actually visited Sam before heading out), but now that he realizes he has Cas, they don't *have to* choose, they can have both (similar to Rory/Amy)

## Deleted Scenes (Not a Chapter)

### draft notes

Dean: "Let me get this straight. You save the universe but only save the UK part, fly across galaxy is close enough but USA is too far away? This isn't your jurisdiction or something? Pal, not I'm saying, you did a terrible job in protecting the earth, in case you didn't notice, it at least trashed twice if we didn't ..." Doctor: "All due respect, who's behind that? Also, USA almost trashed twice doesn't mean..." River/Amy: "Don't mind him, London gets trashed every Christmas, it's a Doctor and Monster thing." Dean/Cas: "You can say that again."

Dean wrt Doctor/River: "I guess a thousand year age difference isn't a problem then." "You got anything to say about that?" "What? No, no, of course not." (Dean unintentionally glance at Cas, finding him look at him too) "We were married when I was half-way killing him and he was trying to save the world. It's complicated." Dean grins: "Isn't it always?" (unintentionally meet Cas's eyes again) Cas wrt Dean: "When we first met, he shot me and stabbed a dagger in my heart." Dean: "Sorry" Cas small grin: "It's okay. It couldn't harm me anyway"

about Tardis: Cas: "it says 'Pull to open', why do you push?"

on the Tardis console: buttons, handles, sliders, keyboards, displays, trumpet, glass floor, power cables, electrical lines; all sorts of toys. not really keyboards, old-style typewriter. Dean can't help touching them, Doctor: "Don't touch anything" Dean looks disappointed, taking his hand back. But Cas sees he still tries to press on the button closest to him, it blinks blue a few times, but does nothing else. Dean looks like a happy kid with a new toy.

No it's like, colleagues" (Cas narrow eyes), "comrade," (Amy raise eyebrow) "family," (River: "sure"), Dean: "You know what, forget it, just friends. Cas is my best friend, that's all. Drop it" Amy raise hands, surrender: "just asking, as long as you guys figured it out, no problem with me" River to Cas: "That's good enough for you?" Cas: "Why wouldn't it be?"
