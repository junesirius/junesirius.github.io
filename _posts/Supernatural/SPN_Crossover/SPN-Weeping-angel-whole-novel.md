### Locations

#### **Winter Quay**

(apartment block near Battery Park, south end, very close to Statue of Liberty by the shore)

exterior (in script): when looking up at the building from the outside: People are sitting at the windows -- not all of them, but most of them. Just sitting there, quietly looking out. A sense of such despair -- like they're trapped. The various faces -- hollow-eyed, lost, so sad, all of them quite aged. Somehow, just by looking, you can tell they will never leave this place. An old lady staring out. A small girl in a blue silk dress playing peek-a-boo hiding behind her hands.)

apartment interior (in script): A bleak, dusty, characterless apartment. Someone has lived here a very long time. Alone probably. (many items dusty and unused, the old self's breath, ancient and rasping)

(in film): in River's book when Sam Garner walks in : 22 floors, number of rooms in each floor: 0-1st (16), 2-5 (14), 6-14 (12), 15-16 (10), 17-18 (8), 19-20 (6), 21-22 (4), total to 252 rooms; in reality when Rory walks in: 7 floors, number of rooms in each floor: 0 (34), 1 (42), 2 (35), 3 (34), 4 (40), 5 (38), 6 (40), 7 (39), total to 302 rooms (but Rory's room is Floor 8)

### Characters

- The Doctor:
  - "I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings."
  - "Because --" Breaks off. So sad, so defeated. Maybe more defeated than we've ever seen him. He turns to look at the old man in the bed, summons the will to speak. "-- Because he was so pleased to see you again."

- Rory Arthur Williams (Rm. 802 Winter Quay)
  - ancient man lies on the bed. reaching an ancient, withered hand towards Amy. Rory 2 looking up at her, so desperately sad, so terribly old -- "Amy" -- and the lights die in his eyes. His hand slips from hers and he falls back.
  - Tombstone: In loving memory, Rory Arthur Williams, Aged 82

- Amelia Pond
  - Tombstone: And his loving wife, Amelia Williams, Aged 87

- River Song: detective, writer, book 《Melody Malone》(love Doctor and believe not loved back)
  - "She's got ice in her heart and a kiss on her lips, and a vulnerable side she keeps well hidden." -- Amy
  - "Just you wait 'til my husband gets home"
  - after reset: Doctor's wiping down his Tardis with a damp cloth (it's still a bit charred and battered.) River steps into sight next to him. She has a bucket and cloth and is helping him. The Doctor and the Mrs doing the chores.

- Julius Grayle: crime boss, collector (powerful, wealthy, the Sydney Greenstreet of this world, aging, fleshy, corrupt, sinister)
  - "I want to know if it could feel pain."

- Sam Garner: a private-eye, Bureau of Security and Investigation private investigator (and everything you'd want him to be) (cynical, shrewd, world-weary but in such a Hollywood way) (die in Rm. 702 Winter Quay)
- the locked weeping angel at Grayle's study: scariest, damaged, scarred, emaciated, like it's starving. Its face is feral and ganged, but its mouth is stretched open in what could be a terrible scream of pain, with a length of chain holding it by the wrist and binding it to the wall. The whole thing is framed and lit as if were a beautiful exhibit. It's screaming and the others can hear it.

### Relationships

- Amy: "Husband, run!" River: "Husband, shut up!" Dean: (swallow) Sam: (amused, glimpse at Dean/Cas) Dean: (blush)

#### Doctor/River

- "How did you get your wrist out without braking it?" "You asked, I did. Problem?" "You just changed the future." "**It's called marriage**, honey. Now hush, I'm working. " (On the Doctor -- just a little dazed that she managed to do that. And under that, so happy. Maybe there's hope.) "She's good, her, have you noticed? Really, really good."
- The Doctor now crosses to River. She's sitting on the stairs, trying to not to cradle her wrist. It lies limply across her lap. She's a little stiff, a little frosty -- doesn't like being caught out, and **especially doesn't like being vulnerable**. The Doctor -- very gentle now -- sits next to her. "Why did you lie to me?" "**When one is in love with an ageless god who insists on the face of a twelve year old, one does one's best to hide the damage.**" The Doctor is gently taking River's wrist in his hands. "It must hurt. Come here." "Yes. The wrist is pretty bad too." **He just looks at her, a little pained by that. She can't quite meet his gaze -- like she's ashamed of saying that.** On the Doctor -- a decision. Now on his hand, holding River's wrist. It's glowing, like regeneration. "No! No, stop that, stop that, stop it." He grips his glowing hand round her wrist. The fierce glow envelopes her arm too -- and then snaps off. He kissed her hand. "There we go. How's that?" She glares at him. "Well let's see, shall we." And she uses that hand to slap him hard across the face. "That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy -- nothing is gained by you being a sentimental idiot." "River --" "You *embarrass* me!" "River --" And she gets up, strides to the front door, and slams out. On the Doctor -- what?
- River outside the door, collecting herself. Amy coming through the door -- approaching carefully, as you do on those occasions. A beat. "Okay, so why did you lie?" "**Never let him see the damage. And never, ever, let him see you age. He doesn't like endings.**"
- "You're the woman he loves." "No, I'm not. The Doctor does not and has never loved me. I'm not lying." "You're the woman who loves the Doctor." "Yes, I am. I've never denied it. But **whoever said he loved me back? He's the Doctor. He doesn't go around falling in love with people.** And if you think he's anything that small or that ordinary, then you haven't the first idea of what you're dealing with." "I assure you, she is the perfect bait. This woman is in danger, the Doctor will always come." "You're a moron. No, he won't." "He's probably already here." "No, he isn't. Of course, he isn't. God knows where he is now but I promise you he's doing whatever the hell he wants and not giving a damn about me. And **I'm just fine with that.** **When you love the Doctor, it's like loving the stars themselves. You don't expect a sunset to admire you back.** And if I happen to find myself in danger, let me tell you, **the Doctor is not stupid enough, or sentimental enough, and he is certainly not in love enough to find himself standing in it with me!**" "Hello, sweetie." "You are so doing those roots." "What, the roots of the sunset?" "Don't you dare." "I'll have to check with the stars themselves." "Oh, shut up." (S09E13, after S07E05)
- "What you said to Amy, there's a worse day coming for you?" "When I first met the Doctor, a long, long time ago, he knew all about me. Think about that. Impressionable young girl and suddenly, this man just drops out of the sky. And he's clever and mad and wonderful and knows every last thing about her. Imagine what that does to a girl. Trouble is it's all back-to-front. My past is his future. We're traveling in opposite directions. Every time we meet, I know him more, he knows me less. I live for the days when I see him, but I know that every time I do, he'll be one step further away. And the day is coming when I'll look into that man's eyes, my Doctor, and he won't have the faintest idea who I am. And I think it's going to kill me."(S06E01, before S07E05)
- "**I can't let you die without knowing you are loved, by so many and so much. And by no one more than me.**" (S06E13, before S07E05)

#### Amy/Rory + Doctor/Amy

Rory: "I always wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty. I guess she got impatient." He skips up on the low wall skirting the edge of the building, and turns to face Amy, the city glittering behind him. "You'll *die*." "Yeah, exactly. Twice in the same building on the same night. Who else could do that? This is the right thing to do. This will work. If I die now, it's a paradox, right. The paradox kills the Angels, tell me I'm wrong. Go on, please, 'cos I'm really scared." Amy: says nothing. "Oh, great! The one time you can't manage it!" Rory falters, almost falling, Amy steadies him. He's breathing hard, afraid, struggling to cope with this. He takes Amy's hand, presses against the center of his chest. "Amy... I think I'm going to need a little help here." Amy and Rory, facing each other, her hand still on his chest, his hand holding it there. "Stop it! Just stop it!" "Think it through. This will work, this will kill the Angels." "It'll kill you too." "Will it? River said this place would be erased from time, never exist. If this place never existed, what did I fall off?" "**You think you'll just come back to life?**" "**When don't I?**" "Rory --" "And anyway, what else is there? Dying of old age downstairs, never seeing you again? **Amy, please, if you love me, then trust me, and push.**" "I can't." "You have to." "Could you? **If it was me, could you do it?**" "**To save you, I could do anything.**" On Amy: a decision is reached. She takes Rory's hands, and puts his arms around her. "Prove it." "I can't take you too." "You said we'd come back to life. Money-where-your-mouth-is time." "Amy --" "Shut up. Together. Or not at all." Doctor: "What the hell are you doing?" Rory and Amy don't take their eyes from each other. Amy: "Changing the future. **It's called marriage.**" A breath. And together the step from the edge, toppling over.

Doctor: "Amy!!!" Too late. Now, on Rory and Amy falling, in terrible, tragic slow motion -- still wrapped in each other's arms, turning as they fall. Pushing closer on the Doctor -- like it's his worst ever moment. "Amy!! Amy!!" And then -- silence. And then -- screams from below, cars swerving horns blaring. On the Doctor and River: Frozen, listening. Just goes on and on, worse and worse. Then -- a crackle of energy, energy-like lightning flashing over the face of the Statue of Liberty, and engulfing the roof. The whole building now glowing around them. The whole place shaking now, glowing fiercer and fiercer. **And the Doctor is *grinning*.**

#### Doctor/Amy

"Amy, please, just come back into the Tardis. Come along, Pond, please." Amy considers that, tears streaming. The Doctor now takes her hand. **Imploring. A direct, naked appeal.** Amy: resolved. She pulls her hand from his. On the Doctor: it's like this action has a physical impact on him, *hurts* him. "Raggedy man..." and she swings round to face him, her body now obscuring the Angel behind her. "Goodbye!" And she vanishes -- the Angel revealed behind her, its hand extended in the time-zapping position. "No..." The Doctor -- just shock. She's gone. Really, really gone.; River flying the Tardis. The Doctor slumped on the stairs, lost in his darkest thoughts. He's trying to pull himself out of them.

#### Blurb at the back cover

Melody Malone

A private detective in old town New York

New York Growled at my window. A friend once told this was the town of a million stories.

Some nights I felt like they were all happening to me. This was one of those nights.

But what the hell -- my stocking seams were straight, my lipstick was combat ready, and I was packing cleavage that could fell an ox at twenty feet.

### Music BGM

"Englishman in New York" by Sting

## Theory

### Original settings

#### Weeping Angels

- "People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff." (DW310) (Dean: "That's just so English")
- "Fascinating race, the weeping angels. The only psychopath in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death, the rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye. You die in the past and in the present, they consume the energy of all the days you might have had. All your stolen moments. They're creatures of the abstract, they live off *potential* energy." (DW310) ("timey-wimey detector" Dean: I made a better hand-made EMF than that when I was ten.)
- "creatures from another world" "The Lonely Assassins, they used to be called. No one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the universe, or very nearly. And they have survived this long because they have the most perfect defense system ever evolved. They're quantum locked. They don't exist when they're being observed. The moment they're seen by any other living creature, they freeze into rock. No choice, it's a fact of their biology. In the sight of any living thing, they literally turn to stone. And you can't kill a stone. 'Course, a stone can't kill you either, but then you turn your head away. Then you blink. And, oh yes it can. (Don't take your eyes off that) That's why they cover their eyes. They're not weeping, they can't risk looking at each other. Their greatest asset is their greatest curse. They can never be seen. Loneliest creatures in the universe." "Your life could depend on this. Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They're fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away and don't blink." (DW310)
- A weeping angel, is the deadliest, most powerful, most malevolent life form evolution has ever produced. The weeping angels can only move if they're unseen. It's quantum lock. In the sight of any living creature, the angels literally cease to exist. They're just stone. The ultimate defence mechanism. Being a stone, until you turn your back. That which holds the image of an angel becomes itself an angel. The eyes are not the windows of the soul, they are the doors. Beware what may enter there. (DW604)

#### Paradox

- About paradox: "If Rory got out, it would create a paradox. This is the Angels' food source. The paradox poisons the well. It could kill them all. This whole place would literally *un*happen." "It would be almost impossible." "Loving the almost." "But to create a paradox like that, it takes almost unimaginable power. What have we got? Tell me, come on, what?" A silence. Then Amy reaches for Rory's hand takes it. "**I won't let them take him. That's what we've got.**" "Rory, even if you got out, you'd have to keep running for the rest of your life. They would be chasing you *forever*." "Well then. Better get started."
- After reset: "You collapsed the timeline, the paradox worked; we are pinged back where we belong." "What, in a graveyard?" "This happened the last time. Why always here?" "Does it matter? We got lucky; we could have blown New York off the planet. I can't ever take the Tardis back there, the timelines are too scrambled. I could have lost you both. Don't ever do that again." And he folds them both into the biggest hug. "What did we do? We *fixed* it, we solved the problem, --" "I was talking to myself." And kisses them both on the head.

#### Plot setting

"Displacing someone back in time, creates time energy, and that's what the Angels feed on. But normally it's a one-off -- a hit and run. If they could keep hold of their victims, feed off their time energy over and over again... This place is a farm. A battery farm. (Rounds on River) How many Angels in New York?" "It's like they've taken over every status in the city." "The *Angels* take Manhattan! Because they can, because they've never had a food source like this one. The city that never sleeps."

### Crossover settings

weeping angel is a kind of angel disease, purgatory virus, leviathan triggered

angels invading purgatory to save Cas, get infected, become mutated angels

petrify to sculpture shape with uncontrollable time travel ability and quantum-lock, can't move if stared at

spread infection by touching other angels

human get touched get zapped back in time

angels can feel pain, can laugh, can scream, others can hear

can be locked by iron handcuff

why infected/weeping angel sends people back/touch them: (Cas's theory) maybe not to harm them, but asking for help, angels have instinct to heal by touch, so they're looking for touch to self-cure, or they're too lonely, so they capture these humans to keep themselves accompany; (Doctor's theory) they feed on time energy, they capture these human for food source; (Dean's theory) they're and they've always been bastards, so they're just continuing being bastards, want to feed *and* attract more angels and hunters over, so they can spread the disease and get more food; or that's the karma for them, about time they pay for being assholes all these times (which pains Cas to think any of them deserve this bc he can hear the angels' screaming of pain even if they're not really alive as stones)

## Outline

### Ideas

Cas is infected when trying to save people (Winchesters/Ponds), self-sacrifice

Doctor/River save destiel, destiel save Amy/Rory

Doctor want to kill weeping Cas and stopped by Dean

Cas is a "good" weeping angel with them → deliberately turn off the light and/or close their eyes, and let Cas be free and move, Doctor/etc. freak out, Cas take care of other bad angels, Dean win the bet because he has faith (BAMF Cas)

Cas buy them time by using all his eyes in his true form to stare at all sculptures all at once so none of them can move again, so the sacrifice is he can't move either (not a solution, so give up)

Dean has to stare at Cas too when Cas is weeping angel. Not blinking, stare save the day

~~put Amy/Rory in background but not emphasize? otherwise three pairs in focus, too many people? don't reverse Amy/Rory's glorious heartbreaking grand exit? death means something, that's the only way to make life mean something → what's written in stone is unchangeable, creating another paradox will rip the universe apart~~

Dean: "Let me get this straight. You save the universe but only save the UK part, fly across galaxy is close enough but USA is too far away? This isn't your jurisdiction or something? Pal, not I'm saying, you did a terrible job in protecting the earth, in case you didn't notice, it at least trashed twice if we didn't ..." Doctor: "All due respect, who's behind that? Also, USA almost trashed twice doesn't mean..." River: "Don't mind him, London gets trashed every Christmas, it's a Doctor and Monster thing." Dean/Cas: "You can say that again."

Dean distrust Doctor at first: "What? I'm supposed to just trust him like that? He's an alien with two hearts!" Cas: "I'm a celestial being with too many eyes and no body." Dean choked: "Which side are you?"

why angels go to Purgatory to save Cas: canon way, Naomi ordered, think Cas useful, want to brainwash him; why didn't brainwash: Cas fights and escapes, run away before they can find him, so best not to use his mojo/fly so he won't be found by the angels → but end up still use his power to save those people he cared

cute comments about how come the cheapest hotel sounds like 5-star penthouse; you can't live in anywhere too far away from any landscape in Manhattan; comments about American & English & Scottish accent

Doctor: "Don't blink, don't look them in the eyes" Dean: "What's wrong with their eyes" Amy: "Trust me, you don't want to know."

### Plot (early draft)

Dean back from Purgatory through portal, Cas back later saved by angels (remembered angel's war, concerned, not brainwashed ← important hint) (Sam with Amelia, undisturbed)

Dean&Cas find case in Manhattan: statue moving, people disappearing & sudden aging, tomb with wrong dates (death earlier than birth) → go investigate

Dean&Cas first notice Rory zapped away, run into Doctor/Amy (self-intros, Doctor/Cas discuss time flux), Doctor has River's book (mentioned Dean/Cas sacrifice+Amy/Rory farewell (keep it vague), River's broken wrist, gives specific time location), Cas fly 4 of them to 1938, too many weeping angels there, everyone in danger, Cas power limited because of all the angel/temporal energy

Dean/Amy volunteer to check Rory, Dean protect Amy & zapped away to Winter Quay, meet Rory; Dean/Rory try to find exit, surrounded by angels, back away in corridor, notice familiar angel face (Tessa 201, Inias 721, Samandriel 802, Ion 821, Hannah 918, Benjamin 1210, Mirabel 1210), realize infection pattern

River break wrist (fail to change future), Doctor/River's love talk (River thought not loved back), Cas hear & cure River; Amy use Doctor's device to locate Dean/Rory, 4 of them go save, see room names, all witness old Dean die (Cas uneasy); River/Amy's love talk (Dean/Cas both hear)

weeping angel besiege attack, all escape to roof, Statue of Liberty attack, Cas show true form, stare all directions with all eyes, everyone shut eyes (Rory/Amy love talk, Dean/Cas hear), but Cas can't keep doing that, eventually can't maintain true form in this plane; Statue of Liberty almost touch Dean/Rory, Cas jump in front of him, get turned into statue too, Dean/all stare at him, Cas can't move

Liberty continue attack, all think no way out, Dean trust Cas, ask them for all faith, look away from Cas for a sec, Cas disappear, Liberty & other statues disappear, Cas move back, still statue

Doctor wants to sonic beam Cas, Dean furious, think Doctor wants to hurt/destroy him, but actually to link his time energy to call Tardis, can bring them all back to 2012; Dean ask River about paradox (River talk about how it's like to love Doctor, observable, related), get confirm if he dies now he create paradox, maybe can save Cas; a few deliberate blink scene sequence, Cas move to him, want to hug but can't, weeping/crying, Dean jump the building

timeline reset, everyone back to 2012, Doctor confirm time flux explosion kill most weeping angels, Dean worry about *most* may not include Cas, but Cas show up, actually weeping (not sculpture) because he overjoy Dean is alive but hate to see him die for him; Doctor/River bicker (book), Amy/Rory resign (farewell), Dean/Cas confession, HE

## Claim info

### Claim Summary

Canon-divergent to both SPN and DW, post-Purgatory before SPN S08E01 and closely follow plotline in DW S07E05, Dean and Cas come back to Earth after Purgatory, notice people missing and things weird in Manhattan, think it's a case, they go there investigating. They run into Doctor and Amy, find out Rory is the latest victim who gets zapped to the past, and weeping angel is the cause/monster. They fly back in time to 1938 to fix the problem and save people, only to find actually weeping angel sculptures are angels infected by Purgatory disease. The whole Manhattan in 1938 is in danger. All six of them have to find a way to fix the angels and humans and save the world together. There are a lot of sacrifices and realizations, the relationships between Doctor/River and Amy/Rory are very educational and relatable for Cas/Dean.

### Visual Element

On the roof of a very tall building, Cas is a weeping angel sculpture, his wings spread out all big and wide in a protective posture, protecting Dean Amy Rory from a very terrifying, huge, overwhelming Statue of Liberty that's threatening and attacking them. The 11th Doctor is also holding out his arms in a very similar protective gesture, trying to protect the humans they care. Amy and Rory are hugging. Dean stands on the edge of the building, ready to (or already) jumping out.

### Author's notes before the story

This story is heavily inspired by and adapted from Doctor Who's S07E05 episode with the same title, many of the scenes are heavily rewritten from the show because the original storytelling is so astonishing as is. Many quotes as well. Anything I'm not doing right is probably my bad, and most of the brilliant settings and story ideas should credit to the original show creators and production teams.

The music that accompanies the creation of this story is Sting's 1987 song "English man in New York," also used in the original show.

Rain pours down the city, soaking the buildings and the statues in gloomy coldness. The night is deep, but the city is still awake. Lights glittering in every window and lining the streets. A city that never sleeps.

Thunders roar from the distance, water streaming down the face of two statues standing across the street from a grand mansion. The statue of a woman holding the hand of a little boy. Light is extraordinarily bright in the building, seeping out from the windows to light up the stretches of the road in front of it like day time, shining on the faces of the statues. A man stands behind the window, gazing at the night street, biting his cigar.

The Detective hurries toward the glamorous building. The black umbrella barely has a chance against the storm. A carriage passes by on the street, water puddles splashing under the horse's hoofs.

The giant door opens slowly with numerous tedious clicks of locks unbuckling, opening to a slit merely wide enough for the Detective to pass through sideways. Eyes of two guards in fine suits and hats peer through the opening, glancing at the night outside warily. The door is closed tightly immediately after.

"Detective," the man turns from the window, holding a hand toward his new guest, "Julius Grayle." He greets with a pretentious nod.

"Honor." The Detective gives a short nod as reply, not taking his hand. "Every man and woman in New York knows your name, Mr. Grayle."

Grayle turns to the window, smoking his cigar. His reflection looks behind him on the bright window glass. "So are you, Detective, I heard you are the best investigator in Manhattan. So, will you take the case?"

"Sure. Why not?" The Detective smirks an amused smile.

"Because you don't believe me." The man waves a hand casually, not shifting his eyes. The mother and son statues are barely visibly in the downpour from across the street now. The night is even darker by each passing minute.

The guards read his gesture and bring forth a leather briefcase, opening it on the luxurious study desk. Fresh bills bundled neatly inside.

The Detective glances at the display, looking back at the reflection of the man. "For that as payment plus expenses? I'll believe any damn thing you say."

"But you don't believe that statues can move." Grayle finally takes his gaze away from the window, turning round, studying his guest's face.

The Detective says nothing.

"You're right, Detective. They can't. Of course they can't... " Grayle pauses a beat meaningfully, "... when you're looking."

The Detective just eyes him, then, "Whatever it is, I'm sure there is an explanation."

"I'm counting on that." Grayle grins a humorless smile. "Good night, Detective. And good luck." He nods at the guards and turns back to the window. His look is troubled now, frowning at the night street outside.

The Detective picks up the cash from the desk, puts on the hat and coat, and follows one of Grayle's men out.

Across the street, light leaking from the mansion shines on the place where the statues were. Rain pours down on the empty plinth, wetting the stone.

<br>

The address written on the back of the business card Grayle left on top of the briefcase is an apartment building several blocks away, near Battery Park. Statues stand crowdedly among the trees in the park and near the building, leaving shadows like living beings under the night sky. The red neon sign on top of the building reads "Winter Quay."

The Detective walks up the steps leading to the building's entrance, and pauses midway, glancing at the flanking statues on the two sides uneasily. They are big weeping angel sculptures, wings closed on the back, hands covering the faces, water streaming down their fingers like tears.

The rain is relentless, and the air is prickling, leaving the kind of feeling that one is watched silently for each step from behind.

The building is tall, steeping among Manhattan's forest of skyscrapers. Most of the windows are open on the tall floors regardless of the drencher, some of the lower levels' too.

The Detective glances at the windows, meeting the eyes of a young girl in blue dress. The girl stands alone by the window, wind flowing her dress and hair in all directions. She covers her face in her palms, closing her eyes, then suddenly looking out from behind her hands. Her lips mummer some words that The Detective cannot hear, a warning or just a playful "peek-a-boo" no one would ever know.

Next to her window, an old lady stares out. Her eyes are hollowed, lost focus, and so, so sad just by the look of them. Next to hers, is another aged men, the same tired, lifeless look. Then more of the same. All aged, all quiet, all defeated. The look of trapped and lost.

The Detective shifts the gaze uncomfortably, moving to walk up the remaining steps. The doors open automatically at the newcomer's approach, swinging slowly back on their own. The Detective hesitates at the threshold, eyeing the inside warily.

The street light shines into the hallway, showing a grand but deserted space. The metal sign by the empty elevator well is rusty, the letters noting the number of rooms on each floor are shallow and dusty, looking as aged as the residents peeping out from the windows.

The elevator well is old-styled, with hollow metal structure like a half-finished construction site. The Detective approaches it cautiously, one hand resting close to the back of the belt where the pistol is.

"Hello?" The Detective voices carefully, then almost startles at a sudden loud sound of clanking noise. The sound echoes in the empty space.

An ancient elevator wheezes its way down to the ground level, the metal door squeaks open.

Looking up, there is no showing who -- or what -- might have sent it down, The Detective steps in the cramped space hesitantly. The door rattles behind.

There is no button or handle to indicate which floor to go to. The elevator clanks into life, rising on its own accord.

The Detective turns around inside the elevator, startled again. The weeping angel statue that was outside the building, is now standing exactly where the human was moments ago, facing the elevator. Its face cupped in its hands, its wings spread open.

"What the hell?" The Detective gasps.

The lift rises beyond the first floor, blocking the view of the statue shortly.

<br>

The floor it stops at looks like a luxurious hotel floor, with crimson velvet carpet layering on the corridor. The lights on the ceiling flicker occasionally, as dim as candlelight. The long, bleak corridor is quiet, with doors and rooms on each side. A weeping angel statue sits at the end of the corridor inside an alcove, hands covering its face, head lowered in a humble, solemn pose.

The Detective steps down the corridor carefully, glancing at either side. Some doors are closed, some open. Behind each open door, there is an empty small room to live in. And on each closed one, there is a number and a name tag.

The Detective checks the names on the doors, slowly, one by one, until stops dead at one closed door -- with the familiar name of his own.

The unlocked door is easily pushed open. The Detective knocks on it as he enters, "Hello, anyone home?"

The small apartment room has a narrow, dusty doorway, as bleak and ancient as the rest of the building. But with a small hint of someone has been living here, probably alone, probably a very long time.

The cloth rack by the door has a hat and coat hanging on it. A tall, black gentleman hat, and a long suit coat, exactly like the ones The Detective is wearing, though much older. He touches his own coat self-consciously, moving down the doorway with more unease by each step.

Lying on the shelf next to the coat rack, a leather briefcase. Dusty and unused. Exactly the same as the one in his grasp right now.

The Detective frowns deeply, putting down the one he's holding on the floor, opening the one in front of him. He drops it in a gasp -- the neatly bundled cash lies inside, with a handwritten card reading "Winter Quay" in fading ink on the very top.

His heart pounds fast. He reaches for his own briefcase, almost ready to dash for the door, only to be stopped by a weak sound behind him. A voice that sounds like a moan or a whimper.

The door leads to a bedroom, cramped and bleak, with only a bed in the center and barely anything else.

The Detective can't help himself crossing into the room.

The old man lying in the bed must be in his nineties, his breath ancient and withered, like the last leaf on a winter tree.

"Who are you?" The Detective approaches the bed, curiosity and horror taking over the action.

The old man's eyes flicker open, staring at the his bedside visitor with dead fish's eyes, his voice croaked for lack of use: "Run! Run! They're coming for you! They'll send you back!"

"Who's coming? Back where?" The Detective is alarmed. The light in the room and in the corridor flickers harder. There is long stretch of dark moments between lights. A loud stomping sound pounds on the ground from far distance.

"In time! Back in time!" the old man struggles hard, rising his upper body to clutch on The Detective's arm, gasping urgently, "I'm you! *I'm you!!*"

Then his struggle stops abruptly. His movement falls still. He closes his eyes as the last strength is drawn out. A last breath is rattled from his throat, and then there is no more.

Freaked out, The Detective glares at the body in the bed, stumbles a few steps back, and flees toward the door.

He races out of the apartment as fast as he can, only to halt abruptly as he sees the weeping angel statue that was in the alcove has left its place. The hands are lowered, the face with hollow eye sockets facing him, one hand reaching out to him like an invitation, undoubtedly trying to touch.

The Detective rushes to the opposite way. The elevator sighs a stop, the doors clattering open, and inside the lift, the weeping angel that was outside the building stands straight, hands reaching out, mouth open, showing sharp, ugly fangs.

The Detective's mouth agape, "What the --"

He stirs around, only to find the one from the alcove has moved forward, standing still halfway down the corridor. Looks back to the elevator, the other statue is outside the lift now.

The Detective desperately turns around, looking for a way out. Only then does he notice the green emergency sign over his head marking "Exit" with an arrow pointing at the door behind him. And thank god, that door marks "Stairs."

He throws himself through it. The corridor light dies at the same moment.

The emergency light wakes in the stairwell, leaving weak green patches of light and shadows. The Detective lunges for the downward stairs, but shadows of two statues are already there, frozen as he stares at them. He glances upward then blinks down, those two shadows are already around the corner. The arms of the statues reaching out in an attacking pose.

The Detective races up the stairs without looking back.

<br>

He bounds up the stairs for his dear life, slamming the stairwell door the moment he reaches the rooftop, blocking it with some scattered iron bars he finds on the floor.

The rooftop is high above the ground, the light from top of Chrysler Building looks only a short distance away. This sleepless city has flowing lights in the skyline and on the street, but at this moment, to his horror, the whole city's light blinks. And in each brief moment of darkness, the loud crashing sound shakes the earth. The sound of something giant stomping on the ground, moving closer step by step.

WHOMP!

The city's light blinks.

WHOMP!

The building shakes.

WHOMP!

The sound comes from directly behind. The Detective turns around slowly.

The giant shadow of a massive statue falls on him. Its face over the far edge of the rooftop, its mouth wide open. A torch in her right hand.

The Detective gasps in horror and total disbelief: "You gotta be kiddin' me!"

<br>

## Chap 2 Missing In New York

> (Dean POV)(Act 1 setup)
>
> Dean back from Purgatory through portal, Cas back later saved by angels (remembered angel's war, concerned, not brainwashed ← important hint; why not: escaped) (Sam with Amelia, undisturbed) ← passing lines in chat
>
> Dean&Cas find case in Manhattan: statue moving, people disappearing & sudden aging, tomb with wrong dates (death earlier than birth) → go investigate
>
> find River's book in their motel, Cas read, find their own name/alias/mention in the story, goes to the place book says they will be

Birds chatter noisily around the tables, chirping cheerfully while fighting for the food crumbs on the ground. Apparently the chilliness of early autumn in the city is not enough to keep them quiet or away, neither is the man sitting by the table, protecting his French fries from these thieves.

Dean shoos at the birds, waving a hand aggressively, trying to keep his meal as safe as he can.

"Maybe if you feed them some, they'd just leave," Cas says from the other side of the table, not looking up from the book he's reading.

"No, then they'd just all come asking for a piece and I don't have anything left to eat!" Dean takes a large bite on the French fries in his hand, chewing as if for revenge. "Look at them, that must be how they end up all gleamy and fleshy, I don't think I've ever seen pigeons in any other place rounder than them."

Cas looks up to observe the pigeons at his words, agreeing with a quiet hum. The pigeons are indeed looking very healthy and well-fed. He looks back at his book, turning a page.

"Man, I'm telling you, New York, even the pigeons are richer." Dean grins.

"I'm not sure that's true," Cas answers with a serious face. "There are poor people in this city."

Dean barks a laugh. "It's good to have you back, Cas. Speaking of, how do you feel? You know, after Purgatory puke me out, I'm still getting use to my sea legs. It's only been, what, a week?"

Cas keeps his eyes on the book, his shoulders stiffen a little, voice quieter. "I feel fine. And if you don't mind, I'd rather *not* think about the angels that have to siege the Purgatory to save me -- against my will -- and I have to, *again*, fight them off to run away. I already tried my best to not harm any more of them, but I think some of them are still hurt because of me, some are even my friends. If it's not for me, Inias and Hannah wouldn't even be in the Purgatory, I didn't even have time to check if they survived the incursion. And there are more that didn't --"

"That's not your fault, you know that, right, Cas?" Dean lowers his voice too, glancing around, more self-aware now that they are in the middle of a sea of ordinary human. "It's a good thing you get to run away before that Naomi bitch can do anything to you, whatever she has in mind. Let's keep it that way."

Cas gives a small nod in agreement, his shoulders slack.

"Now let me just finish my food and we'll get back to work." Dean swallows down the food, and takes another exaggeratedly huge bite on the burger, sighing with satisfaction.

Cas glances at him with a small smile.

"Miss the food and everything." Dean talks with food in his mouth, gesturing their surroundings, "Not like Purgatory has any Michelin stars or anything."

Sunlight shines on the shade above their table, bright color glittering through the leaves. The diner's outdoor seating is already over busy and crowded even though it's way earlier than usual lunch hour. The street is jammed with vehicles of all kinds, cars and buses and pedestrians moving in all directions. It seems this city is just soaked with life at every possible space, at any time.

"Maybe we can come here more often if you like it so much," Cas offers. "Not only when there are cases."

"Nah, big towns aren't really our thing," Dean dismisses, stuffing down the rest of the burger, licking his fingers for the last bit taste of fries and salt. "There is a reason we don't go to big name places like Los Angeles or New York. The loose ends can bite."

Cas nods quietly. "I understand."

Dean wipes his mouth as he finishes, and throws the used paper napkin on the plate, "Now, where are we?"

Cas blinks, "We are in the Josie's Burger near Central Park."

Dean tries to muffle the laugh and sigh that are fighting in his throat. "Yes, we are. I mean where are we on the case?"

"Same as last night," Cas pulls out a piece of newspaper folded between the book pages, spreading it on the least oily corner of the table. The missing people notice takes half the page, and the page after that shows a photo of some local cemetery. The title reads "Death Earlier Than Birth."

"That sure is an eye-catching title, I'll give you that," Dean nods at the flourishing inky letters, turning the paper one hundred and eighty degrees so he doesn't need to read upside down, "How many missing people so far?"

"Ten until yesterday, we don't know if there are more in the past twenty four hours." Cas answers.

"The earliest missing is a week ago." Dean checks the handwritten notes on the margin. They have managed to do some digging, but not enough to connect the dots yet.

"About the same time when I came back." Cas says what's in both their minds.

"You thinking what I'm thinking?" Dean says. Their eyes meet.

"That angels have something to do with that?" Cas frowns.

"Possible, cemetery and death stuff, could be your department. I can't see any connections between the victims. You got anything about the tombs and statues?"

"Reports said some statues move the places or poses, and the dates on some of the tombs are clearly wrong. The police found three new tombs with the missing people's names on it, but the dates of death are earlier than their dates of birth, therefore 'Death earlier than birth'."

"People with the same names?" Dean suggests.

"Three pairs of people with same names? Too much coincidences, don't you think?" Cas narrows his eyes.

"New York is a big city." Dean shrugs, though he doesn't buy the theory either. Since when do they have the luck that things are *just coincidence* anyway.

"So what should we do?" Cas asks, his fingers absently fidgeting the corner of the book. "Shall we call Sam?"

"Nah, we can handle without him." Dean's face is unreadable for a moment. "He got what he wanted, an apple-pie life with a pretty woman, don't think I can do it again to rob him from that kind of life."

"Dean, I don't think --"

"Cas." Dean doesn't let him finish, giving him a stern look that means "drop the topic," Cas falls silent. Dean sighs after a beat, "We'll call him later then, alright? After finishing this one, we can do the catch-up or whatever."

"Alright," Cas murmurs, grabbing the book and ready to stand up from the diner seat. "Where are we going next?"

"To the cemetery -- want to check out those tombs first. Maybe we can find something the police missed. If we have time later, ask around the victim's family -- standard questions." Dean stands up, gesturing for Cas to follow. "Only a few blocks away, we can cross the Central Park. Come on."

They walk out of the diner, merging into the ocean of pedestrians on the streets.

Dean leans closer to avoid them getting separated by the crowd.

Cas tucks the book into the trench coat pocket.

Dean regards his move closely suddenly, looking him up and down, then landing his gaze on the book, as if he only starts to notice it now. "Where did you get that book?"

"What, this one?" Cas follows his gaze, flipping the book over to show him the cover. The title reads "Melody Malone," with a drawing of a sexy lady detective in a sheathy leather jacket, her face hidden in the shadow of a large detective hat, only showing red lips kissing a smoking gun.

"I like the cover," Dean comments with a small smile, taking the book and skimming random pages, "looks like some old-time detective novel."

"Yes, it is a rather intriguing story about a private detective in old town New York." Cas confirms. "I found it in the motel drawer."

Dean turns to the back cover, reading out loud: "New York growled at my window. A friend once told this was the town of a million stories.

"Some nights I felt like they were all happening to me. This was one of those nights.

"But what the hell -- my stocking seams were straight, my lipstick was combat ready, and I was packing cleavage that could fell an ox at twenty feet."

He looks up from the blurb, amused, "Whoever wrote this, I like her already. 'Packing cleavage that could fell an ox at twenty feet!'"

Some passers-by glance at them with curious eyes, probably overhearing the last bit.

Cas lowers his voice, "Why do you read it out?"

"I don't know, why do you read it at all?" Dean thumbs the pages casually, eyes gleaming with mischief.

"I thought it's a tour guide or something, maybe it can help us know more about New York or the case." Cas murmurs.

But Dean has stopped listening. He slowly straightens his back, grabbing the opened page with too much force on the knuckles. His eyes focus dead on the page. His steps frozen.

Cas drags him off the street, leading them onto a smaller road quiet enough to talk.

"What is it, Dean?" Cas hurries in his most worried voice.

Dean reads out the lines he's staring at: "A handsome young man walks into the room, flashing a clearly fake FBI badge before our eyes, saying with probably his most persuasive, charming smile, 'I'm Agent Plant. This is my partner, Agent Page.'

"The man next to him in trench coat has the bluest eyes I've ever seen. He pulls out a similar badge from his suit, displaying it upside down.

"The first man sighs and corrects it for him, and the second man murmurs some words that are actually loud enough for us to hear: 'Is it really necessary, Dean?'

"And Dean answers with another sigh: 'Not really, 'cause I read from the book they already knew it's fake. Just testing.'"

<br>

## Chap 3 Taking The Case

> (Dean POV)(Act 1 inciting incident)
>
> Dean&Cas first notice Rory zapped away, run into weeping angel first-hand for the first time

They stare at each other, eyes wide with disbelief and -- if Dean's honest with himself -- a little bit of horror.

"How's that possible?" Dean gasps and rereads the paragraph.

He reaches inside his suit pocket for the badge, which he already knew without really needing to double-check would show "Agent Plant," as well as Cas's would be "Agent Page."

"How can we possibly appear in a book that you found in a random motel drawer, that's probably been there forever?" Dean stares at Cas unbelievably, shaking his head. His fingers turn the book to the next page, just about to read what's next, when Cas suddenly grabs the book from him, slamming the pages shut.

"No, Dean! We can't read anymore." Cas clutches the book's spine hard. "I think -- I wish I'm wrong -- but I think time travel is involved here. The book might have the past that is going to be our future. We can't read early."

"But maybe it can help us save those missing people, solve the mystery?" Dean raises his eyebrows, "It might have all the answers we are looking for."

"And if we read and find you're dead?" Cas's voice turns harsh.

Dean swallows, but he doesn't back down, "Then we change it. We change the time and fate and everything all the time. Remember Titanic?"

Cas snorts a self-mockery laugh, "Exactly, and see how that turns out."

"But you fixed it." Dean pats him on the shoulder encouragingly, "I'm sure we can figure something out too this time even if the worst comes."

Cas lowers his head, "I just don't want to make any more mistakes. Can we at least take it slowly? Maybe only read when we absolutely have to."

Dean thinks about that, "Alright, don't ever say I never listen to you. Right now, how about we stick to the original plan then?"

They emerge back to the busy 72nd St., heading to Central Park.

<br>

The hustle and bustle of the city is blocked out the moment they walk into the green space of Central Park. Ten minutes in, and they almost forget they are still in the middle of the most abustle cities in the world.

People are jogging, or running, or walking dogs. In a plaza, a group of opera singers are rehearsing maybe some grand performances in the future. Artists set up sketch stands by the roadside, painting the view onto white papers. Tourists with heavy backpacks take photos of everything -- pinecones falling from the trees, commemorative sculptures of historical figures, cute dogs passing by, landmarks of the city. With the tree crowns covering the sky, even the highest skyscrapers of Manhattan is out of view.

Dean sniffs the air long and slow.

The air smells green and fresh.

"Do you sometimes think nothing bad can happen in places like this?" Dean can't help asking. "It's like, places like this are too bright and happy to be intruded by dark, nasty monsters. Monsters are in caves and undergrounds, the dark places under the bed or in closets, they'd never come to beautiful sunshine places like this."

"I certainly hope that is true." Cas nods.

They walk past the crowds, taking a short cut through the underpass in Bethesda Terrace. The fountain splashes under the bright sun, an angel statue standing on the very top. Not many people around the fountain today, only a couple of old people strolling slowly. A busker is singing some beautiful folk songs with a weathered guitar. Cas leaves a twenty dollar bill in his opened guitar box.

"That's Hannah," Cas points at the angel statue on the fountain when they pass it. "I know her."

"What, really? A real angel?" Dean takes a second look at the statue. The female figure looks more human than any angel he came to know in the past few years, wearing a long silky robe instead of in any suits. A pair of wings stretching from her shoulders. "No harp or halo?"

Cas's eyes are still on the static statue, as if he's looking at something *inside* the statue that Dean can't see. "Not her true form, but the statue, that's for Angel of Water. And water is her charge. I think I can even hear her just from the statue, I don't know it's possible."

"And those are her children?" Dean points at the four small baby angels around the base of the fountain.

"The cherubs?" Cas shifts his attention to those chubby little statues, "No, she doesn't have any children. I think those are just human imagination of what cherubs look like, wrong as always. They are not impotent babies wearing diapers, much like cupids."

"Yeah I remember that naked dude two three years ago." Dean chuckles at the memory.

"They're good arts with nice names, nonetheless." Cas tilts his head, examining them carefully.

"They have names?" Dean asks curiously.

"Of course they do. You humans have a habit of naming everything." Cas answers casually. "They are Peace, Health, Purity, and Temperance."

"Like dogs. I get it." Dean nudges him gently. "Come on, let's keep moving."

Cas follows him, but he glances back shortly again. "For some reason I think they're alive." He frowns lightly, a little confused.

"What, like the statues are talking to you?" Dean eyes him from the side.

"More like giggling. Are you sure you can't hear anything?"

Dean listens carefully for a moment. "Nope, only the dude singing." He nods at the busker. "Nice voice."

A man walks past them, holding three coffees in his hands, struggling to keep balance.

Cas looks back at the cherubs one more time, and he stops his steps.

"Oh come on, you have eyes on your back or something?" Dean stops too, turning around when he finds Cas didn't keep up.

"I have eyes in all directions, but not on this vessel's back." Cas answers seriously, his frown deepens. "Dean, look."

That's Cas's "there is something seriously wrong here" voice.

Dean is on guard immediately. "What is it?"

"The cherubs, they are gone."

Cas is right. The base of the fountain is bare now. The Angel of Water -- Hannah -- on top of the fountain stays standing, water spouting from the top and arching into the pool below, but the place where the four cherub statues were, it's empty now.

"Okay, weird." Dean says slowly, moving in the trained scouting gait, stepping up trying to take a closer look at the statue.

"Wait, Dean." Cas grabs his arms before he can take another step, "There's something else wrong --"

Dean meets his eyes, nervous and alarmed. Their pupils shrink. It's so quiet he can almost hear his own breathing.

Dean whispers, "Since when did the music stop?"

They snap their heads toward the busker. The place only has a lone guitar box on the ground.

"He's gone." Cas says.

"Yeah I can see that." Dean steps back slowly, away from the fountain, swallowing hard. "What the hell's happening?"

A distorted giggling sound echoes from behind them, together with some tiny little patters.

Dean whispers, "Please tell me I'm hallucinating, but does that sound like tiny stone babies running and laughing to you?"

Cas meets his eyes, nodding. "That's what I heard earlier."

"Hello? Did you hear anything?" A man asks behind them. Dean almost jumps.

"Jesus!" He glances back. It's the same guy passing them minutes ago. His hands still occupied with too many coffee cups.

"The giggling? Yes." Cas answers him.

The Coffee Guy is visibly relieved for a moment. "Oh great," he says, in an English accent, "I thought I was imagining things. I think something odd is happening here."

"You think?" Dean pointedly nods at the busker's guitar box. Cas checks on the angel fountain again.

"Do you know anything about it?" Cas asks without looking back, but doesn't hear any answer.

"Cas!" Dean yells with a hitched voice, grabbing him backward with large steps.

The Coffee Guy has disappeared from the thin air. Where he was standing, on the ground, there are the four missing cherub statues, frozen in a fumbling, crawling shape, just like some frozen frame of playful little babies having fun in their own way.

They back away quickly, keeping their eyes on the statues.

"Guess we find the missing cherubs, at least." Dean says, breathing fast.

"Not funny, Dean." Cas says.

"Not laughing." Dean replies. "Long shot, but, any chance you know what's happening here? Anything to do with angels?"

"They are not really angels, they are just statues." Cas stares at the cherubs. They remain still in his gaze. "They're not real. How can they possibly be alive?"

"I'm not sure 'alive' is the right term here." Dean glances back to check how much farther they can back away before hitting anything. "I have a theory but I don't want to test it."

"Dean?" Cas glances quickly at Dean then looks back at the stones. The cherubs have moved in that split of a second when he's not looking. They moved closer to them, small chubby arms reaching out like babies asking for a cradle, mouths opening, tiny fangs showing at the edge of the lips.

Dean gasps again when he looks back, dragging both of them hurried away farther from the statues. "Don't look away!" He snaps. "Here's my theory: They can only move when we are not looking. So as long as we keep our eyes on them, we are safe."

"What do you think happened to the people disappeared? Are they dead?" Cas asks, not blinking at all as he stares.

"I don't know, let's hope not. We'll figure that out after we get out of here first. You think you can fly us out of here?" Dean feels his eyes sore and dry quickly with too long time of not blinking.

"I still have my wings, if that's your question." Cas answers stoically. "But I'd rather not use them if possible."

"Why not?"

"Naomi and the angels might still be looking for me, in case you forget, they are not happy when I got away." Cas manages a well-maintained, stable voice. "Using any angelic power or my wings might make it very easy for them to locate me and continue the process they intended to apply on me last time."

"Alright, no fly, no mojo, then. But we gotta find a way out quick. 'Cause I can't keep on not blinking for any longer." Dean moans.

"I have my eyes on it. You can blink." Cas tells him.

Dean relaxes a little, blinking a few times to soothe the dryness in his eyes.

"Don't blink! Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink!! Blink and you're dead!" A skinny man yells at them from across the plaza, pointing a flashing device at them, dashing in their direction, followed by a ginger-haired girl.

<br>

## Chap 4 The Skinny Guy

### Act 1

Dean automatically looks back at the cherubs, following the order. "I'm not blinking." He says, answering to the skinny guy.

The cherub statues haven't moved an inch since they start staring at them.

The man rushes to their side, pointing the buzzing device in his hand directly at the statues. The device gives off an electronic beeping sound. Dean keeps trying to steal a glimpse at what he's doing, but doesn't dare to move his gaze away. He watches the man from the peripheral of his eyes.

There is a pitch and turn in the buzzing sound as the man moves his hand around, with an explosion sound as a final touch. The cherub statues fly backward a few feet, and shattered to pieces.

Dean assumes that should mean it is safe to stop staring now. He turns his head, pointing at whatever-it-is in the man's hand, and he says, "I want one of these."

The man waves it around like a kid showing off a new toy that only he has, and he says, "My sonic screwdriver? Sorry, limited edition, the only one in the universe."

"What did you do to them?" Cas asks from Dean's side.

"Absorbed the temporal energy they just ate, that should starve them weak for a few minutes before their next feed. They might come back any time though." The man tilts the sparkling pen-looking thing -- sonic screwdriver, he said? -- and flashes it a few times, frowning as if he's reading something from a tiny screen on its body. "I think they just absorbed energy from at least two people, maybe three."

"Who are you?" Dean snaps.

The man looks up from the screwdriver, meeting his eyes, waving a hand roughly in their direction, uttering rapidly, "Hello, I'm the Doctor, I'm a Time Lord. This is Amy, she's Scottish. We are time travelers. Any questions? No? Good. Now, where is Rory?"

Dean looks him up and down. The skinny man is about his height, his hair as ruffled as Cas's in his early days, wearing a shirt and a brown tweed jacket. Dean's gaze land on his collar, "I gotta ask, bowtie, really?"

The Doctor widens his eyes a little, straightening his bowtie self-consciously, "Bowtie is cool."

Dean and the girl -- Amy -- chuck at the same time.

That's when Cas says, "Yes, I have questions. I thought Time Lords are extinct after the Time War, the whole Gallifrey is wiped from existence."

Dean stares at him, "What?"

The Doctor does the same, "How?" A pause, then narrows his eyes, "You are not human."

Cas answers flatly, holding the gaze, "Neither are you."

Dean raises his voice, "You know them?"

Cas breaks the gaze to turn his head to Dean, "They are aliens. Gallifreians, specifically. But they call themselves Time Lords -- it sounds better. They have two hearts and regeneration abilities, basically twelve lives for each one of them." He looks back at the Doctor, "Did I miss anything?"

The Doctor considers for a beat, "Sounds about right."

Dean's still staring at Cas, "Aliens. You know aliens exist and you never thought to tell me?"

Cas stares back, "You never asked."

Dean rolls his eyes, "Any other aliens? Lizard-people are real?"

Cas says, "A lot. They're actually called Silurian, local on Earth, and Earth is not the only planet with life forms..."

Amy calls over their voices, "Guys, focus! Not the time!"

Dean turns to her and says quickly, "Sorry."

Cas says the same. "Sorry."

The girl with red hair has an attractive face and a very strong commanding charisma that people just tend to listen to her, Dean notices.

Amy asks, "Where is Rory?"

Dean waves his hands to gesture the height and hair, "The Coffee Guy? Yay high, nerdy hair, shirt and jacket?"

Amy nods, "That's him. He was just buying us coffees. Where is him?"

Cas answers with a compassionate voice, "I'm sorry, but the statues touched him --"

"-- and he just disappeared." Dean finishes the sentence.

"Oh God," Amy covers her mouth, turning to the Doctor, her voice desperate, "where did they send him?"

The Doctor looks restless, his eyes swimming around the fountain and the empty terrace, not meeting Amy's eyes. "I don't know." he says, in a regretful, uneasy voice. "I'm sorry, Amy, but I don't know."

Dean studies them, "Wait, so, you know what happened to him?"

Cas says beside him, "The statues, you know what they are, don't you? You told us not to blink. What are they?"

The Doctor nods briefly, "They are not statues. They're Weeping Angels, the deadliest, most powerful, most malevolent life form evolution has ever created. The Lonely Assassins, they used to be called. No one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the universe, or very nearly. They have the most perfect defence mechanism that nature has ever evolved. They're quantum locked. They don't exist when they're being observed. The moment they're seen by any other living creature, they literally turn to stone, and you can't kill a stone. 'Course, a stone can't kill you either, but then you turn your head away. Then you blink. That's when they hit, they kill you nice and slow, no mess, no fuss -- they send you back into the past and let you live to death, the rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye. You die in the past and in the present, they consume the energy of all the days you might have had. All your stolen moments. They're creatures of the abstract, they live off *potential* energy."

Dean needs a moment to process the information, he starts with "So --" But that's as far as he goes.

"Guys! The angel!" Amy points over his head.

Dean and Cas turn sharply. Behind them, the Angel of Water has moved when none of them lay their eyes on it. The probably mother statue of the four cherub statues has turned toward them, wings spreading wider than before, face fierce with fangs. Her hands are claws with long nails now, frozen in the posture of reaching out toward them.

Cas's face is strange at the sight of it.

Dean tries not to panic, "Is it me or does she look more pissed than usual?"

The Doctor answers, "Maybe I shouldn't blow up her children in her face."

"What do we do, Doctor?" Amy asks in a pitched voice.

"Can't you use your sonic thing on her again?" Dean says to his back, not dare to move his eyes away.

The electronic buzz sounds up over their head. Dean can see a shade of bright blue at the corner of his eyes.

But nothing happens to the statue.

"Ah, she's too strong for the same trick." The Doctor says frustratedly. "The usual then, run! Run!!"

"Where?!" Dean yells.

"The Tardis!" The Doctor yells back from a small distance. It sounds like they already started the running without them.

"WHAT?!" Dean shouts.

"THE TARDIS!!" The Doctor is farther away, heading out of Central Park to the southeast side.

Backing away with your eyes focused on a creepy statue without blinking is impossible, let alone running. Dean finds out.

He holds out an arm to keep balance, just in case there is anything on the ground behind him that might trip him over. Cas grabs his hand, keeping him guided, and maybe to keep himself balanced as well.

The two of them take their steps back cautiously together, step by step.

"Now would be a really good time if you can just fly us out or use those other eyes you said you have." Dean says gloomily.

"Or you can go, I'll keep staring." Cas offers.

"No," Dean snaps immediately without thinking, "no way I'd just leave you here. Not again."

Cas falls quiet for a short moment.

They can't hear any other footsteps behind or around them.

"You think those two might just run off?" Dean can't help wondering aloud. "We might just be two big idiots and the perfect baits to keep the statue thing still, so they can buy some time to get away."

"You don't trust them?" Cas asks.

"What, you do?" Dean retorts, "He's an alien with two hearts and a funny bowtie!"

"And I'm a celestial being with wings and no body." Cas says flatly.

Dean makes a choked sound, "Which side are you?"

Cas lets out a stifled chuckle, "Yours, of course."

Dean is not convinced, "We don't even know what that 'Tardis' thing is."

Just as he speaks, a loud wheezing sound echoes from the sky. The air around them ripples like bad animation, turning from open outdoor space to a dimly lit space with green and blue light.

A cheerful voice sounds up behind them, "Gentleman and gentleman, welcome aboard the Tardis."

<br>

### Act 2

Cas lets go of Dean's hand.

They look around.

The Doctor busies himself around a central structure that Dean's pretty sure is where all the engine and control units are -- if any of the sci-fi movies has any truth in them. A huge, bright pumping column vibrate up and down, making loud whirring sound -- that's the sound they heard when the whole thing just materialized itself around them.

Dean regards the structures, walking slowly toward the console and the Doctor running around it. "Does all your toys have to make funny noises?"

Amy can't hold back a small laughing sound.

The Doctor rolls his eyes at Dean, "This is Tardis! Of course she has to make this beautiful sound! What do you know about 'Time and Relative Dimension in Space'?"

Dean stutters, "Ugh, come again?"

The Doctor



### draft notes

Doctor: "If you don't know anything about her, why don't you just shut up and move away, don't touch anything, while I fly us somewhere relatively safe." Cas defends Dean about knowledge of TARDIS, Doctor uneasy, Amy: "he doesn't like *not* being the smartest man in the room" (Dean gives Cas a secret thumb up)

Doctor talk about Tardis non-stoppingly, it's his home, Dean notice he keep referring it as She, he can relate: "I see, so it's like Impala"

Dean: "I might have an idea what's happening here" (intro the book)

Cas: "how do you where to look" how does Doctor/Amy know where to find Rory: not the book, sonic screwdriver detect strange temporal energy surge, they follow the signal, worry Rory might be in trouble, turns out the worry is real

Dean/Doctor: "Doc" "Don't call me Doc, it's Doctor to you"

can't land the Tardis in 1938 because too much time distortion there, like trying to land a plane in a blizzard, even River couldn't do it. River gets there by Vortex Manipulator, less bulky than a Tardis, a motorbike through traffic (the whole city is time locked, but Cas can fly there, like running man in the traffic)

Dean: "Let me get this straight. You save the universe but only save the UK part, fly across galaxy is close enough but USA is too far away? This isn't your jurisdiction or something? Pal, not I'm saying, you did a terrible job in protecting the earth, in case you didn't notice, it at least trashed twice if we didn't ..." Doctor: "All due respect, who's behind that? Also, USA almost trashed twice doesn't mean..." River/Amy: "Don't mind him, London gets trashed every Christmas, it's a Doctor and Monster thing." Dean/Cas: "You can say that again."

Doctor: "People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff." (DW310) (Dean: "That's just so English")

> Dean/Amy volunteer to check Rory, Dean protect Amy & zapped away to Winter Quay, meet Rory

### draft notes

meet River, intro scene:

Dean reads out the lines he's staring at: "A handsome young man walks into the room, flashing a clearly fake FBI badge before our eyes, saying with probably his most persuasive, charming smile, 'I'm Agent Plant. This is my partner, Agent Page.'

"The man next to him in trench coat has the bluest eyes I've ever seen. He pulls out a similar badge from his suit, displaying it upside down.

"The first man sighs and corrects it for him, and the second man murmurs some words that are actually loud enough for us to hear: 'Is it really necessary, Dean?'

"And Dean answers with another sigh: 'Not really, 'cause I read from the book they already knew it's fake. Just testing.'"



Dean wrt Amy/Rory: "So you two are married." Cas wrt Doctor/River: "You two are also married." Amy wrt destiel: "And you are --?" Dean: "No, no, we, uh, we are best friends." Amy: "Sure." River: "Thought I heard you said you're partners" Dean: "What? The agents thing? No, no, that's just, partner in crime kinda thing" Cas: "Dean--" Dean: "Yeah sorry you're right, made it worse. No it's like, colleagues" (Cas narrow eyes), "comrade," (Amy raise eyebrow) "family," (River: "sure"), Dean: "You know what, forget it, just friends. Cas is my best friend, that's all. Drop it" Amy raise hands, surrender: "just asking, as long as you guys figured it out, no problem with me" River to Cas: "That's good enough for you?" Cas: "Why wouldn't it be?" Dean cheerfully: "See? all sorted out now, no problem at all" Dean/Cas meet eyes, look away

Dean wrt Doctor/River: "I guess a thousand year age difference isn't a problem then." "You got anything to say about that?" "What? No, no, of course not." (Dean unintentionally glance at Cas, finding him look at him too) "We were married when I was half-way killing him and he was trying to save the world. It's complicated." Dean grins: "Isn't it always?" (unintentionally meet Cas's eyes again)

wrt River/Amy/Rory: father/mother "It's complicated, time travel thing" "Isn't it always" +1

Doctor: "timey-wimey detector" (Dean: "I made a better hand-made EMF than that when I was ten.")

## Chap 6 Night In The Statue Park

> (Dean POV)(Act 2 realization)
>
> Dean/Rory try to find exit in Winter Quay, surrounded by angels, back away in corridor, notice familiar angel face (Tessa, Inias, Hannah, ~~Samandriel~~), realize infection pattern (phone call Cas?)
>
> discuss weeping angel's motives

### draft notes

Dean/Rory talks about feeling, Rory talks about Amy, Dean: "you waited her for two thousand years? Why?" Rory: "Do you have anyone you'd do anything to protect them, save them whatever it takes?" Dean: "I guess" "Then you should know how it feels to leave them behind. I can't do that. So I guarded her." "She wouldn't even know" "It doesn't matter. To save her, I can do anything." "Even condemn the world?" "Hopefully not, but if it means she's saved, maybe then. Not like we haven't done it before" Dean raise eyebrow, Rory: "Long story" (Rory ask about Dean's past story, Dean: "Long story", long story everywhere)

Dean ask about Rory's family here, Rory mention Brian, topic of family, bury seed of Rory/Amy's final decision of leaving Doctor

why infected/weeping angel sends people back/touch them: (Cas's theory) maybe not to harm them, but asking for help, angels have instinct to heal by touch, so they're looking for touch to self-cure, or they're too lonely, so they capture these humans to keep themselves accompany; (Doctor's theory) they feed on time energy, they capture these human for food source; (Dean's theory) they're and they've always been bastards, so they're just continuing being bastards, want to feed *and* attract more angels and hunters over, so they can spread the disease and get more food; or that's the karma for them, about time they pay for being assholes all these times (which pains Cas to think any of them deserve this bc he can hear the angels' screaming of pain even if they're not really alive as stones)

## Chap 7 Calling The Doctor

> (Cas POV)(Act 2 mid-point, moment of truth)
>
> River break wrist (fail to change future), Doctor/River's love talk (River thought not loved back), Cas hear & cure River
>
> Amy use Doctor's device to locate Dean/Rory, 4 of them go save, see room names, split witness old Dean die (Cas uneasy), Amy see old Rory
>
> River/Amy's love talk (Dean/Cas both hear)

### draft notes

Doctor/River: "Why did you lie to me?" "When one's in love with an ageless God who insists on the face of a 12-year-old, one does one's best to hide the damage" "It must hurt. Come here." "Yes. The wrist is pretty bad, too" "That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy. Nothing is gained by you being a sentimental idiot." (Doctor: "Not like I need it anymore" "No" "Yes. We both know I only get twelve chances, this is the last one, so it will be.")

River/Amy: "okay, why did you lie?" "Never let him see the damage. And never, ever, let him see you age. He doesn't like endings."

Amy: "Husband, run!" River: "Husband, shut up!" Dean: (swallow) others: (amused, glimpse at Dean/Cas) Dean: (blush)

Reuse River's confession lines when she doesn't recognize 12th Doctor in S09E13 "The Husbands of River Song", loving Doctor is like loving stars themselves, doesn't expect sunset to admire you back (Dean's the same with Cas): "The Doctor does not and has never loved me. I'm not lying. But **whoever said he loved me back? He's the Doctor. He doesn't go around falling in love with people.** And if you think he's anything that small or that ordinary, then you haven't the first idea of what you're dealing with. God knows where he is now but I promise you he's doing whatever the hell he wants and not giving a damn about me. And **I'm just fine with that.** **When you love the Doctor, it's like loving the stars themselves. You don't expect a sunset to admire you back.** And if I happen to find myself in danger, let me tell you, **the Doctor is not stupid enough, or sentimental enough, and he is certainly not in love enough to find himself standing in it with me!**" "Hello, sweetie." "You are so doing those roots." "What, the roots of the sunset?" "Don't you dare." "I'll have to check with the stars themselves." "Oh, shut up."

## Chap 8 The Angels Take Manhattan

> (Dean POV)(Act 2 plot point 2+Act 3 twist)
>
> weeping angel besiege attack (kill all NYC lights first), all escape to roof, the Statue of Liberty attack, Cas show true form, stare all directions with all eyes, everyone shut eyes (Rory/Amy love talk, Dean/Cas hear), but Cas can't keep doing that, eventually can't maintain true form in this plane (Doctor can sonic a few to send them away but not enough, detail for later)
>
> start the paradox talk here (River talk about how it's like to love Doctor, observable, related), get confirm if he dies now he create paradox, Dean already starts considering suicide to save the world (but still a little hesitant), Cas doesn't let him, huge argue
>
> the Statue of Liberty almost touch Dean/Rory, Cas jump in front of him, get turned into statue too, Dean/all stare at him, Cas can't move
>
> Cas's stonization isn't instant, start from feet up, can't move, eyes the last, Dean has to witness the process, it's painful for both, that's why Cas has time to spread the wing before the process complete so his statue shows protective wings for Dean

### draft notes

(Liberty is Naomi)

Cas buy them time by using all his eyes in his true form to stare at all sculptures all at once so none of them can move again, so the sacrifice is he can't move either (not a solution, so give up)

Dean has to stare at Cas too when Cas is weeping angel. Not blinking, stare save the day

Cas is a "good" weeping angel with them (same as when with normal asshole angels) → deliberately turn off the light and/or close their eyes, and let Cas be free and move, Doctor/etc. freak out, Cas take care of other bad angels, Dean win the bet because he has faith (BAMF Cas)

## Chap 9 Death At Winter Quay

> (Dean POV)(Act 3 climax)
>
> Liberty continue attack, all think no way out, Dean trust Cas, ask them all for faith, look away from Cas for a sec, Cas disappear, Liberty & other statues disappear, Cas move back, still statue
>
> Doctor wants to sonic Cas, Dean furious, think Doctor wants to hurt him (happened before to other angels before), but actually to link his time energy to call Tardis, can bring them all back to 2012 (but can't cure Cas)
>
> Dean finalizes the decision to suicide to save Cas (hesitant for saving world, determined if it saves Cas)
>
> Dean/Rory argue who to sacrifice, Amy/Rory willing jump together
>
> a few deliberate blink scene sequence, Cas move to him, want to hug but can't, weeping/crying, Dean jump the building
>
> (for a sec make it looks like not working)

### draft notes

Cas sending most angels back in time, clear the city of weeping angels, Doctor: "Guess it's solved, more or less" Dean: "More or less? What does that mean? Will they come back?" Doctor: "Technically they can, but if Cas stays here, he can send them back again. Probably should call him Guardian Angel of Manhattan now." Dean: "But what about Cas?" "What about him?" "Will he ever come back normal? Un-stoned?" Doctor: "I'm sorry" Dean: "No" "What do you mean 'no'?" "I mean no, if this is the reality, I don't want it, I'm going to bring him back" "I know it's difficult to lose someone..." Dean: "No you don't! I'm not going to leave him again, not ever again! We come here together, we go home together. I'm not leaving him in this bloody 40s New York like this. I'll do it, whatever it takes. I'll save him, whether you like it or not."

Dean's strongest reason to sacrifice instead of Amy/Rory: You have each other, I have no one now. If it doesn't work, try something else, help him, and maybe let my brother know. (give Doctor his phone)

"To save you, I could do anything." -- Rory/Dean

## Chap 10 Last Farewell

> (Dean POV)(Act 3 wrapping up)
>
> timeline reset, everyone back to 2012, Doctor confirm time flux explosion kill most weeping angels, Dean worry about *most* may not include Cas. Not see Cas immediately, Dean worried
>
> Cas finally show up, still weeping angel, Dean panicked; Doctor suspect bc he's in the center of the timeline explosion, might be "survivor" not recovered, Dean suggest another paradox to fix him, Doctor warn it will rip earth apart, Dean: "I save the Earth enough times, about time it saves us for once"
>
> Cas statue hold hand as if want to touch Dean but restrain himself, Dean willingly approach, want to be touched, even if he may get zapped back; then the moment they touch, Cas start reverting, bit by bit, reverse process of stonization
>
> Cas back normal, disoriented, actually weeping, bc overjoy Dean's alive again but hate to see him die for him again; dean overjoy Cas's back
>
> Doctor/River bicker (book→deliver to Dean/Cas's motel room), Amy/Rory resign (farewell→fulfill last chapter), Dean/Cas confession, HE

### draft notes

destiel reunion: hug "Don't do that again" "Same goes for you"

Amy/Rory make the decision to leave Doctor bc of Dean/Cas, importance of family (remember to mention Rory's dad Brian in early conversations, "Don't you have anyone waiting for you to come home" "My dad waters plants for us"), Dean/Cas decide to call Sam and reunite together bc of Amy/Rory

Doctor/Cas: "see you next time, somewhere in the universe, some time in the future or past" "Look forward to it, Doctor" smile and wave goodbye

cute comments about how come the cheapest hotel sounds like 5-star penthouse; you can't live in anywhere too far away from any landscape in Manhattan (about where to deliver the book in timeline)
