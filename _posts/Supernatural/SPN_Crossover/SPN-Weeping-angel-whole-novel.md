### Quotes

- "People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff." (DW310) (Dean: "That's just so British")
- "Fascinating race, the weeping angels. The only psychopath in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death, the rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye. You die in the past and in the present, they consume the energy of all the days you might have had. All your stolen moments. They're creatures of the abstract, they live off *potential* energy." ("timey-wimey detector" Dean: I made a better hand-made EMF than that when I was ten.)
- "creatures from another world" "The Lonely Assassins, they used to be called. No one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the universe, or very nearly. And they have survived this long because they have the most perfect defense system ever evolved. They're quantum locked. They don't exist when they're being observed. The moment they're seen by any other living creature, they freeze into rock. No choice, it's a fact of their biology. In the sight of any living thing, they literally turn to stone. And you can't kill a stone. 'Course, a stone can't kill you either, but then you turn your head away. Then you blink. And, oh yes it can. (Don't take your eyes off that) That's why they cover their eyes. They're not weeping, they can't risk looking at each other. Their greatest asset is their greatest curse. They can never be seen. Loneliest creatures in the universe." "Your life could depend on this. Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They're fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away and don't blink."
- "Why did you lie to me?" "When one's in love with an ageless God who insists on the face of a 12-year-old, one does one's best to hide the damage" "It must hurt. Come here." "Yes. The wrist is pretty bad, too." "That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy. Nothing is gained by you being a sentimental idiot."
- "Okay, why did you lie?" "Never let him see the damage. And never, ever, let him see you age. He doesn't like endings."
- River/Doctor: "How did you get your wrist out without braking it?" "You asked, I did. Problem?" "You just changed the future." "**It's called marriage**, honey. Now, hush, I'm working. "
- Amy: "Husband, run!" River: "Husband, shut up!" Dean: (swallow) Sam: (amused, glimpse at Dean/Cas) Dean: (blush)
- Rory: "I always wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty. I guess she got impatient." before jump: "I think I'm going to need a little help there." "Amy, please, if you love me, then trust me, and push." "I can't." "You have to." "Could you? If it was me, could you do it?" "To save you, I could do anything." "Prove it." "I can't take you too." "You said we'd come back to life. Money-where-your-mouth-is time." "Amy..." "Shut... up. Together. Or not at all." Doctor/River: "What the hell are you doing?" "Changing the future. **It's called marriage**"
- about paradox: "If Rory got out, it would create a paradox. This is the Angel's food source. The paradox poisons the well. It could kill them all. This whole place would literally un-happen." "It would be almost impossible." "Loving the 'almost'." "But to create a paradox like that takes almost unimaginable power. What have we got? Tell me, come on, what?" "**I won't let them take him. That's what we've got.**" "Even if you got out, you'd have to keep running for the rest of your life. They would be chasing you for ever." "Well, then. Better get started."; "You collapsed the timeline, the paradox worked, we are pinged back where we belong." "What, in a graveyard?" "This happened the last time. Why always here?" "Does it matter? We got lucky. We could've blown New York off the planet. I can't take the Tardis back there, the timelines are too scrambled. I could have lost you both. Don't ever do that again." "What did we do? We fixed it, we solved the problem." "I was talking to myself."
- River/Doctor (both after S07E05): "You're the woman he loves." "No, I'm not. The Doctor does not and has never loved me. I'm not lying." "You're the woman who loves the Doctor." "Yes, I am. I've never denied it. But whoever said he loved me back? He's the Doctor. He doesn't go around falling in love with people. And if you think he's anything that small or that ordinary, then you haven't the first idea of what you're dealing with." "I assure you, she is the perfect bait. This woman is in danger, the Doctor will always come." "You're a moron. No, he won't." "He's probably already here." "No, he isn't. Of course, he isn't. God knows where he is now but I promise you he's doing whatever the hell he wants and not giving a damn about me. And I'm just fine with that. **When you love the Doctor, it's like loving the stars themselves. You don't expect a sunset to admire you back.** And if I happen to find myself in danger, let me tell you, the Doctor is not stupid enough, or sentimental enough, and he is certainly not in love enough to find himself standing in it with me!" "Hello, sweetie." "You are so doing those roots." "What, the roots of the sunset?" "Don't you dare." "I'll have to check with the stars themselves." "Oh, shut up."

## Theory

weeping angel is a kind of angel disease, purgatory virus, leviathan triggered

angels invading purgatory to save Cas, get infected, become mutated angels

petrify to sculpture shape with uncontrollable time travel ability and quantum-lock, can't move if stared at

spread infection by touching other angels

human get touched get zapped back in time

angels can scream, others can hear

can be locked by iron handcuff

## Ideas

Cas is infected when trying to save people (Winchesters/Ponds), self-sacrifice

Doctor/River save destiel, destiel save Amy/Rory

Doctor want to kill weeping Cas and stopped by Dean

Cas is a "good" weeping angel with them → deliberately turn off the light and/or close their eyes, and let Cas be free and move, Doctor/etc. freak out, Cas take care of other bad angels, Dean win the bet because he has faith (BAMF Cas)

Cas buy them time by using all his eyes in his true form to stare at all sculptures all at once so none of them can move again, so the sacrifice is he can't move either (not a solution, so give up)

Dean has to stare at Cas too when Cas is weeping angel. Not blinking, stare save the day

~~put Amy/Rory in background but not emphasize? otherwise three pairs in focus, too many people? don't reverse Amy/Rory's glorious heartbreaking grand exit? death means something, that's the only way to make life mean something → what's written in stone is unchangeable, creating another paradox will rip the universe apart~~

Dean: "Let me get this straight. You save the universe but only save the UK part, fly across galaxy is close enough but USA is too far away? This isn't your jurisdiction or something? Pal, not I'm saying, you did a terrible job in protecting the earth, in case you didn't notice, it at least trashed twice if we didn't ..." Doctor: "All due respect, who's behind that? Also, USA almost trashed twice doesn't mean..." River: "Don't mind him, London gets trashed every Christmas, it's a Doctor and Monster thing." Dean/Cas: "You can say that again."

Dean distrust Doctor at first: "What? I'm supposed to just trust him like that? He's an alien with two hearts!" Cas: "I'm a celestial being with too many eyes and no body." Dean choked: "Which side are you?"

why angels go to Purgatory to save Cas: canon way, Naomi ordered, think Cas useful, want to brainwash him; why didn't brainwash: Cas fights and escapes, run away before they can find him, so best not to use his mojo/fly so he won't be found by the angels → but end up still se his power to save those people he cared

## Plot

Dean back from Purgatory through portal, Cas back later saved by angels (remembered angel's war, concerned, not brainwashed ← important hint) (Sam with Amelia, undisturbed)

Dean&Cas find case in Manhattan: statue moving, people disappearing & sudden aging, tomb with wrong dates (death earlier than birth) → go investigate

Dean&Cas first notice Rory zapped away, run into Doctor/Amy (self-intros, Doctor/Cas discuss time flux), Doctor has River's book (mentioned Dean/Cas sacrifice+Amy/Rory farewell (keep it vague), River's broken wrist, gives specific time location), Cas fly 4 of them to 1938, too many weeping angels there, everyone in danger, Cas power limited because of all the angel/temporal energy

Dean/Amy volunteer to check Rory, Dean protect Amy & zapped away to Winter Quay, meet Rory; Dean/Rory try to find exit, surrounded by angels, back away in corridor, notice familiar angel face (Tessa, Samandriel, Hannah), realize infection pattern

River break wrist (fail to change future), Doctor/River's love talk (River thought not loved back), Cas hear & cure River; Amy use Doctor's device to locate Dean/Rory, 4 of them go save, see room names, all witness old Dean die (Cas uneasy); River/Amy's love talk (Dean/Cas both hear)

weeping angel besiege attack, all escape to roof, Statue of Liberty attack, Cas show true form, stare all directions with all eyes, everyone shut eyes (Rory/Amy love talk, Dean/Cas hear), but Cas can't keep doing that, eventually can't maintain true form in this plane; Statue of Liberty almost touch Dean/Rory, Cas jump in front of him, get turned into statue too, Dean/all stare at him, Cas can't move

Liberty continue attack, all think no way out, Dean trust Cas, ask them for all faith, look away from Cas for a sec, Cas disappear, Liberty & other statues disappear, Cas move back, still statue

Doctor wants to sonic beam Cas, Dean furious, think Doctor wants to hurt/destroy him, but actually to link his time energy to call Tardis, can bring them all back to 2012; Dean ask River about paradox (River talk about how it's like to love Doctor, observable, related), get confirm if he dies now he create paradox, maybe can save Cas; a few deliberate blink scene sequence, Cas move to him, want to hug but can't, weeping/crying, Dean jump the building

timeline reset, everyone back to 2012, Doctor confirm time flux explosion kill most weeping angels, Dean worry about *most* may not include Cas, but Cas show up, actually weeping (not sculpture) because he overjoy Dean is alive but hate to see him die for him; Doctor/River bicker (book), Amy/Rory resign (farewell), Dean/Cas confession, HE

## Claim Summary

Canon-divergent to both SPN and DW, post-Purgatory before SPN S08E01 and closely follow plotline in DW S07E05, Dean and Cas come back to Earth after Purgatory, notice people missing and things weird in Manhattan, think it's a case, they go there investigating. They run into Doctor and Amy, find out Rory is the latest victim who gets zapped to the past, and weeping angel is the cause/monster. They fly back in time to 1938 to fix the problem and save people, only to find actually weeping angel sculptures are angels infected by Purgatory disease. The whole Manhattan in 1938 is in danger. All six of them have to find a way to fix the angels and humans and save the world together. There are a lot of sacrifices and realizations, the relationships between Doctor/River and Amy/Rory are very educational and relatable for Cas/Dean.

## Visual Element

On the roof of a very tall building, Cas is a weeping angel sculpture, his wings spread out all big and wide in a protective posture, protecting Dean Amy Rory from a very terrifying, huge, overwhelming Statue of Liberty that's threatening and attacking them. The 11th Doctor is also holding out his arms in a very similar protective gesture, trying to protect the humans they care. Amy and Rory are hugging. Dean stands on the edge of the building, ready to (or already) jumping out.

<br>

can't land the Tardis in 1938 because too much time distortion there, like trying to land a plane in a blizzard, even River couldn't do it. River gets there by Vortex Manipulator, less bulky than a Tardis, a motorbike through traffic (the whole city is time locked, but Cas can fly there)

Dean: "Let me get this straight. You save the universe but only save the UK part, fly across galaxy is close enough but USA is too far away? This isn't your jurisdiction or something? Pal, not I'm saying, you did a terrible job in protecting the earth, in case you didn't notice, it at least trashed twice if we didn't ..." Doctor: "All due respect, who's behind that?

## Act 2

> Dean/Amy volunteer to check Rory, Dean protect Amy & zapped away to Winter Quay, meet Rory
>
> Dean/Rory try to find exit, surrounded by angels, back away in corridor, notice familiar angel face (Tessa, Samandriel, Hannah), realize infection pattern

## Act 3

> River break wrist (fail to change future), Doctor/River's love talk (River thought not loved back), Cas hear & cure River; Amy use Doctor's device to locate Dean/Rory, 4 of them go save, see room names, all witness old Dean die (Cas uneasy), Amy see old Rory; River/Amy's love talk (Dean/Cas both hear)

### draft notes

Doctor/River: "Why did you lie to me?" "When one's in love with an ageless God who insists on the face of a 12-year-old, one does one's best to hide the damage" "It must hurt. Come here." "Yes. The wrist is pretty bad, too" "That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy. Nothing is gained by you being a sentimental idiot."

River/Amy: "okay, why did you lie?" "Never let him see the damage. And never, ever, let him see you age. He doesn't like endings."

Amy: "Husband, run!" River: "Husband, shut up!" Dean: (swallow) others: (amused, glimpse at Dean/Cas) Dean: (blush)

Reuse River's confession lines when she doesn't recognize 12th Doctor in 《The Husbands of River Song》, loving Doctor is like loving stars themselves, doesn't expect sunset to admire you back (Dean's the same with Cas)

## Act 4

> weeping angel besiege attack, all escape to roof, Statue of Liberty attack, Cas show true form, stare all directions with all eyes, everyone shut eyes (Rory/Amy love talk, Dean/Cas hear), but Cas can't keep doing that, eventually can't maintain true form in this plane; Statue of Liberty almost touch Dean/Rory, Cas jump in front of him, get turned into statue too, Dean/all stare at him, Cas can't move
>
> Liberty continue attack, all think no way out, Dean trust Cas, ask them for all faith, look away from Cas for a sec, Cas disappear, Liberty & other statues disappear, Cas move back, still statue

### draft notes

Cas buy them time by using all his eyes in his true form to stare at all sculptures all at once so none of them can move again, so the sacrifice is he can't move either (not a solution, so give up)

Dean has to stare at Cas too when Cas is weeping angel. Not blinking, stare save the day

Cas is a "good" weeping angel with them (same as when with normal asshole angels) → deliberately turn off the light and/or close their eyes, and let Cas be free and move, Doctor/etc. freak out, Cas take care of other bad angels, Dean win the bet because he has faith (BAMF Cas)

## Act 5

> Doctor wants to sonic beam Cas, Dean furious, think Doctor wants to hurt/destroy him, but actually to link his time energy to call Tardis, can bring them all back to 2012
>
> Dean ask River about paradox (River talk about how it's like to love Doctor, observable, related), get confirm if he dies now he create paradox, maybe can save Cas
>
> a few deliberate blink scene sequence, Cas move to him, want to hug but can't, weeping/crying, Dean jump the building

## Act 6

> timeline reset, everyone back to 2012, Doctor confirm time flux explosion kill most weeping angels, Dean worry about *most* may not include Cas, but Cas show up, actually weeping (not sculpture) because he overjoy Dean is alive but hate to see him die for him
>
> Doctor/River bicker (book), Amy/Rory resign (farewell), Dean/Cas confession, HE
