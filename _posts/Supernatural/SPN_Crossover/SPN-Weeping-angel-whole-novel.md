## Draft

title: 《Do Not Blink》《The Angels Take Manhattan》《Look At Me》

timeline: DW705 (2012.9.29), SPN801 (2012.10.3)

SPN S8, destiel fresh out of Purgatory

### DW plots

Time: Apr 3, 1938

Location: Winter Quay (apartment block near Battery Park)

Characters: Rory Arthur Williams, Melody Malone (River, detective, writer), Julius Grayle (collector), Sam Garner (investigator)

Sculptures in Manhattan:

- Central Park, Bethesda Fountain: Angel of the Waters, 4 cherubs (peace, health, purity, temperance)

Quotes:

- "Why did you lie to me?" "When one's in love with an ageless God who insists on the face of a 12-year-old, one does one's best to hide the damage" "It must hurt. Come here." "Yes. The wrist is pretty bad, too" "That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy. Nothing is gained by you being a sentimental idiot."
- "okay, why did you lie?" "Never let him see the damage. And never, ever, let him see you age. He doesn't like endings."

### Theory

weeping angel is a kind of angel disease, purgatory virus, leviathan triggered

angels invading purgatory to save Cas, get infected, become mutated angels

petrify to sculpture shape with uncontrollable time travel ability and quantum-lock

### Plot

Cas/other angels infected with weeping angel (curse? purgatory virus?), people get touched get zapped back in time, "quantum-locked", can't move if looked at

Is Cas infected or is he there to save people (Winchesters/Ponds)? Is he infected by hostile fellow angel, or self-sacrifice to save them?

Do destiel save themselves or saved by Doctor?

Doctor/River save destiel, destiel save Amy/Rory?
