SPN S8, destiel fresh out of Purgatory

## DW info

Time: Apr 3, 1938

### Location

**Winter Quay** (apartment block near Battery Park)

exterior (in script): when looking up at the building from the outside: People are sitting at the windows -- not all of them, but most of them. Just sitting there, quietly looking out. A sense of such despair -- like they're trapped. The various faces -- hollow-eyed, lost, so sad, all of them quite aged. Somehow, just by looking, you can tell they will never leave this place. An old lady staring out. A small girl in a blue silk dress playing peek-a-boo hiding behind her hands.)

apartment interior (in script): A bleak, dusty, characterless apartment. Someone has lived here a very long time. Alone probably. (many items dusty and unused, the old self's breath, ancient and rasping)

### Characters

- The Doctor:
  - "I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings."
  - "Because --" Breaks off. So sad, so defeated. Maybe more defeated than we've ever seen him. He turns to look at the old man in the bed, summons the will to speak. "-- Because he was so pleased to see you again."

- Rory Arthur Williams (Floor 8 Winter Quay)
  - ancient man lies on the bed. reaching an ancient, withered hand towards Amy. Rory 2 looking up at her, so desperately sad, so terribly old -- "Amy" -- and the lights die in his eyes. His hand slips from hers and he falls back.

- Amelia Pond
- River Song: detective, writer, book 《Melody Malone》(love Doctor and believe not loved back)
  - "She's got ice in her heart and a kiss on her lips, and a vulnerable side she keeps well hidden." -- Amy
  - "Just you wait 'til my husband gets home"
  - after reset: Doctor's wiping down his Tardis with a damp cloth (it's still a bit charred and battered.) River steps into sight next to him. She has a bucket and cloth and is helping him. The Doctor and the Mrs doing the chores.

- Julius Grayle: crime boss, collector (powerful, wealthy, the Sydney Greenstreet of this world, aging, fleshy, corrupt, sinister)
  - "I want to know if it could feel pain."

- Sam Garner: a private-eye (and everything you'd want him to be) (cynical, shrewd, world-weary but in such a Hollywood way) (die in Floor 7 Winter Quay)
- the locked weeping angel at Grayle's study: scariest, damaged, scarred, emaciated, like it's starving. Its face is feral an ganged, but its mouth is stretched open in what could be a terrible scream of pain, with a length of chain holding it by the wrist and binding it to the wall. The whole thing is framed and lit as if were a beautiful exhibit. It's screaming and the others can hear it.

### Relationships

- Amy: "Husband, run!" River: "Husband, shut up!" Dean: (swallow) Sam: (amused, glimpse at Dean/Cas) Dean: (blush)

#### Doctor/River

- "How did you get your wrist out without braking it?" "You asked, I did. Problem?" "You just changed the future." "**It's called marriage**, honey. Now hush, I'm working. " (On the Doctor -- just a little dazed that she managed to do that. And under that, so happy. Maybe there's hope.) "She's good, her, have you noticed? Really, really good."
- The Doctor now crosses to River. She's sitting on the stairs, trying to not to cradle her wrist. It lies limply across her lap. She's a little stiff, a little frosty -- doesn't like being caught out, and **especially doesn't like being vulnerable**. The Doctor -- very gentle now -- sits next to her. "Why did you lie to me?" "**When one is in love with an ageless god who insists on the face of a twelve year old, one does one's best to hide the damage.**" The Doctor is gently taking River's wrist in his hands. "It must hurt. Come here." "Yes. The wrist is pretty bad too." **He just looks at her, a little pained by that. She can't quite meet his gaze -- like she's ashamed of saying that.** On the Doctor -- a decision. Now on his hand, holding River's wrist. It's glowing, like regeneration. "No! No, stop that, stop that, stop it." He grips his glowing hand round her wrist. The fierce glow envelopes her arm too -- and then snaps off. He kissed her hand. "There we go. How's that?" She glares at him. "Well let's see, shall we." And she uses that hand to slap him hard across the face. "That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy -- nothing is gained by you being a sentimental idiot." "River --" "You *embarrass* me!" "River --" And she gets up, strides to the front door, and slams out. On the Doctor -- what?
- River outside the door, collecting herself. Amy coming through the door -- approaching carefully, as you do on those occasions. A beat. "Okay, so why did you lie?" "**Never let him see the damage. And never, ever, let him see you age. He doesn't like endings.**"
- "You're the woman he loves." "No, I'm not. The Doctor does not and has never loved me. I'm not lying." "You're the woman who loves the Doctor." "Yes, I am. I've never denied it. But **whoever said he loved me back? He's the Doctor. He doesn't go around falling in love with people.** And if you think he's anything that small or that ordinary, then you haven't the first idea of what you're dealing with." "I assure you, she is the perfect bait. This woman is in danger, the Doctor will always come." "You're a moron. No, he won't." "He's probably already here." "No, he isn't. Of course, he isn't. God knows where he is now but I promise you he's doing whatever the hell he wants and not giving a damn about me. And **I'm just fine with that.** **When you love the Doctor, it's like loving the stars themselves. You don't expect a sunset to admire you back.** And if I happen to find myself in danger, let me tell you, **the Doctor is not stupid enough, or sentimental enough, and he is certainly not in love enough to find himself standing in it with me!**" "Hello, sweetie." "You are so doing those roots." "What, the roots of the sunset?" "Don't you dare." "I'll have to check with the stars themselves." "Oh, shut up." (S09E13, after S07E05)
- "What you said to Amy, there's a worse day coming for you?" "When I first met the Doctor, a long, long time ago, he knew all about me. Think about that. Impressionable young girl and suddenly, this man just drops out of the sky. And he's clever and mad and wonderful and knows every last thing about her. Imagine what that does to a girl. Trouble is it's all back-to-front. My past is his future. We're traveling in opposite directions. Every time we meet, I know him more, he knows me less. I live for the days when I see him, but I know that every time I do, he'll be one step further away. And the day is coming when I'll look into that man's eyes, my Doctor, and he won't have the faintest idea who I am. And I think it's going to kill me."(S06E01)

#### Amy/Rory + Doctor/Amy

Rory: "I always wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty. I guess she got impatient." He skips up on the low wall skirting the edge of the building, and turns to face Amy, the city glittering behind him. "You'll *die*." "Yeah, exactly. Twice in the same building on the same night. Who else could do that? This is the right thing to do. This will work. If I die now, it's a paradox, right. The paradox kills the Angels, tell me I'm wrong. Go on, please, 'cos I'm really scared." Amy: says nothing. "Oh, great! The one time you can't manage it!" Rory falters, almost falling, Amy steadies him. He's breathing hard, afraid, struggling to cope with this. He takes Amy's hand, presses against the center of his chest. "Amy... I think I'm going to need a little help here." Amy and Rory, facing each other, her hand still on his chest, his hand holding it there. "Stop it! Just stop it!" "Think it through. This will work, this will kill the Angels." "It'll kill you too." "Will it? River said this place would be erased from time, never exist. If this place never existed, what did I fall off?" "**You think you'll just come back to life?**" "**When don't I?**" "Rory --" "And anyway, what else is there? Dying of old age downstairs, never seeing you again? **Amy, please, if you love me, then trust me, and push.**" "I can't." "You have to." "Could you? If it was me, could you do it?" "To save you, I could do anything." On Amy: a decision is reached. She takes Rory's hands, and puts his arms around her. "Prove it." "I can't take you too." "You said we'd come back to life. Money-where-your-mouth-is time." "Amy --" "Shut up. Together. Or not at all." Doctor: "What the hell are you doing?" Rory and Amy don't take their eyes from each other. Amy: "Changing the future. **It's called marriage.**" A breath. And together the step from the edge, toppling over.

Doctor: "Amy!!!" Too late. Now, on Rory and Amy falling, in terrible, tragic slow motion -- still wrapped in each other's arms, turning as they fall. Pushing closer on the Doctor -- like it's his worst ever moment. "Amy!! Amy!!" And then -- silence. And then -- screams from below, cars swerving horns blaring. On the Doctor and River: Frozen, listening. Just goes on and on, worse and worse. Then -- a crackle of energy, energy-like lightning flashing over the face of the Statue of Liberty, and engulfing the roof. The whole building now glowing around them. The whole place shaking now, glowing fiercer and fiercer. **And the Doctor is *grinning*.**

#### Doctor/Amy

"Amy, please, just come back into the Tardis. Come along, Pond, please." Amy considers that, tears streaming. The Doctor now takes her hand. **Imploring. A direct, naked appeal.** Amy: resolved. She pulls her hand from his. On the Doctor: it's like this action has a physical impact on him, *hurts* him. "Raggedy man..." and she swings round to face him, her body now obscuring the Angel behind her. "Goodbye!" And she vanishes -- the Angel revealed behind her, its hand extended in the time-zapping position. "No..." The Doctor -- just shock. She's gone. Really, really gone.; River flying the Tardis. The Doctor slumped on the stairs, lost in his darkest thoughts. He's trying to pull himself out of them.

## Theory

### Original settings

#### Weeping Angels

- "People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff." (DW310) (Dean: "That's just so British")
- "Fascinating race, the weeping angels. The only psychopath in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death, the rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye. You die in the past and in the present, they consume the energy of all the days you might have had. All your stolen moments. They're creatures of the abstract, they live off *potential* energy." (DW310) ("timey-wimey detector" Dean: I made a better hand-made EMF than that when I was ten.)
- "creatures from another world" "The Lonely Assassins, they used to be called. No one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the universe, or very nearly. And they have survived this long because they have the most perfect defense system ever evolved. They're quantum locked. They don't exist when they're being observed. The moment they're seen by any other living creature, they freeze into rock. No choice, it's a fact of their biology. In the sight of any living thing, they literally turn to stone. And you can't kill a stone. 'Course, a stone can't kill you either, but then you turn your head away. Then you blink. And, oh yes it can. (Don't take your eyes off that) That's why they cover their eyes. They're not weeping, they can't risk looking at each other. Their greatest asset is their greatest curse. They can never be seen. Loneliest creatures in the universe." "Your life could depend on this. Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They're fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away and don't blink." (DW310)
- A weeping angel, is the deadliest, most powerful, most malevolent life form evolution has ever produced. The weeping angels can only move if they're unseen. It's quantum lock. In the sight of any living creature, the angels literally cease to exist. They're just stone. The ultimate defence mechanism. Being a stone, until you turn your back. That which holds the image of an angel becomes itself an angel. The eyes are not he windows of the soul, they are the doors. Beware what may enter there. (DW604)

#### Paradox

- About paradox: "If Rory got out, it would create a paradox. This is the Angels' food source. The paradox poisons the well. It could kill them all. This whole place would literally *un*happen." "It would be almost impossible." "Loving the almost." "But to create a paradox like that, it takes almost unimaginable power. What have we got? Tell me, come on, what?" A silence. Then Amy reaches for Rory's hand takes it. "**I won't let them take him. That's what we've got.**" "Rory, even if you got out, you'd have to keep running for the rest of your life. They would be chasing you *forever*." "Well then. Better get started."
- After reset: "You collapsed the timeline, the paradox worked; we are pinged back where we belong." "What, in a graveyard?" "This happened the last time. Why always here?" "Does it matter? We got lucky; we could have blown New York off the planet. I can't ever take the Tardis back there, the timelines are too scrambled. I could have lost you both. Don't ever do that again." And he folds them both into the biggest hug. "What did we do? We *fixed* it, we solved the problem, --" "I was talking to myself." And kisses them both on the head.

#### Plot setting

"Displacing someone back in time, creates time energy, and that's what the Angels feed on. But normally it's a one-off -- a hit and run. If they could keep hold of their victims, feed off their time energy over and over again... This place is a farm. A battery farm. (Rounds on River) How many Angels in New York?" "It's like they've taken over every status in the city." "The *Angels* take Manhattan! Because they can, because they've never had a food source like this one. The city that never sleeps."

### Crossover settings

weeping angel is a kind of angel disease, purgatory virus, leviathan triggered

angels invading purgatory to save Cas, get infected, become mutated angels

petrify to sculpture shape with uncontrollable time travel ability and quantum-lock, can't move if stared at

spread infection by touching other angels

human get touched get zapped back in time

angels can feel pain, can laugh, can scream, others can hear

can be locked by iron handcuff

## Outline

### Ideas

Cas is infected when trying to save people (Winchesters/Ponds), self-sacrifice

Doctor/River save destiel, destiel save Amy/Rory

Doctor want to kill weeping Cas and stopped by Dean

Cas is a "good" weeping angel with them → deliberately turn off the light and/or close their eyes, and let Cas be free and move, Doctor/etc. freak out, Cas take care of other bad angels, Dean win the bet because he has faith (BAMF Cas)

Cas buy them time by using all his eyes in his true form to stare at all sculptures all at once so none of them can move again, so the sacrifice is he can't move either (not a solution, so give up)

Dean has to stare at Cas too when Cas is weeping angel. Not blinking, stare save the day

~~put Amy/Rory in background but not emphasize? otherwise three pairs in focus, too many people? don't reverse Amy/Rory's glorious heartbreaking grand exit? death means something, that's the only way to make life mean something → what's written in stone is unchangeable, creating another paradox will rip the universe apart~~

Dean: "Let me get this straight. You save the universe but only save the UK part, fly across galaxy is close enough but USA is too far away? This isn't your jurisdiction or something? Pal, not I'm saying, you did a terrible job in protecting the earth, in case you didn't notice, it at least trashed twice if we didn't ..." Doctor: "All due respect, who's behind that? Also, USA almost trashed twice doesn't mean..." River: "Don't mind him, London gets trashed every Christmas, it's a Doctor and Monster thing." Dean/Cas: "You can say that again."

Dean distrust Doctor at first: "What? I'm supposed to just trust him like that? He's an alien with two hearts!" Cas: "I'm a celestial being with too many eyes and no body." Dean choked: "Which side are you?"

why angels go to Purgatory to save Cas: canon way, Naomi ordered, think Cas useful, want to brainwash him; why didn't brainwash: Cas fights and escapes, run away before they can find him, so best not to use his mojo/fly so he won't be found by the angels → but end up still se his power to save those people he cared

### Plot (early draft)

Dean back from Purgatory through portal, Cas back later saved by angels (remembered angel's war, concerned, not brainwashed ← important hint) (Sam with Amelia, undisturbed)

Dean&Cas find case in Manhattan: statue moving, people disappearing & sudden aging, tomb with wrong dates (death earlier than birth) → go investigate

Dean&Cas first notice Rory zapped away, run into Doctor/Amy (self-intros, Doctor/Cas discuss time flux), Doctor has River's book (mentioned Dean/Cas sacrifice+Amy/Rory farewell (keep it vague), River's broken wrist, gives specific time location), Cas fly 4 of them to 1938, too many weeping angels there, everyone in danger, Cas power limited because of all the angel/temporal energy

Dean/Amy volunteer to check Rory, Dean protect Amy & zapped away to Winter Quay, meet Rory; Dean/Rory try to find exit, surrounded by angels, back away in corridor, notice familiar angel face (Tessa, Samandriel, Hannah), realize infection pattern

River break wrist (fail to change future), Doctor/River's love talk (River thought not loved back), Cas hear & cure River; Amy use Doctor's device to locate Dean/Rory, 4 of them go save, see room names, all witness old Dean die (Cas uneasy); River/Amy's love talk (Dean/Cas both hear)

weeping angel besiege attack, all escape to roof, Statue of Liberty attack, Cas show true form, stare all directions with all eyes, everyone shut eyes (Rory/Amy love talk, Dean/Cas hear), but Cas can't keep doing that, eventually can't maintain true form in this plane; Statue of Liberty almost touch Dean/Rory, Cas jump in front of him, get turned into statue too, Dean/all stare at him, Cas can't move

Liberty continue attack, all think no way out, Dean trust Cas, ask them for all faith, look away from Cas for a sec, Cas disappear, Liberty & other statues disappear, Cas move back, still statue

Doctor wants to sonic beam Cas, Dean furious, think Doctor wants to hurt/destroy him, but actually to link his time energy to call Tardis, can bring them all back to 2012; Dean ask River about paradox (River talk about how it's like to love Doctor, observable, related), get confirm if he dies now he create paradox, maybe can save Cas; a few deliberate blink scene sequence, Cas move to him, want to hug but can't, weeping/crying, Dean jump the building

timeline reset, everyone back to 2012, Doctor confirm time flux explosion kill most weeping angels, Dean worry about *most* may not include Cas, but Cas show up, actually weeping (not sculpture) because he overjoy Dean is alive but hate to see him die for him; Doctor/River bicker (book), Amy/Rory resign (farewell), Dean/Cas confession, HE

## Claim info

### Claim Summary

Canon-divergent to both SPN and DW, post-Purgatory before SPN S08E01 and closely follow plotline in DW S07E05, Dean and Cas come back to Earth after Purgatory, notice people missing and things weird in Manhattan, think it's a case, they go there investigating. They run into Doctor and Amy, find out Rory is the latest victim who gets zapped to the past, and weeping angel is the cause/monster. They fly back in time to 1938 to fix the problem and save people, only to find actually weeping angel sculptures are angels infected by Purgatory disease. The whole Manhattan in 1938 is in danger. All six of them have to find a way to fix the angels and humans and save the world together. There are a lot of sacrifices and realizations, the relationships between Doctor/River and Amy/Rory are very educational and relatable for Cas/Dean.

### Visual Element

On the roof of a very tall building, Cas is a weeping angel sculpture, his wings spread out all big and wide in a protective posture, protecting Dean Amy Rory from a very terrifying, huge, overwhelming Statue of Liberty that's threatening and attacking them. The 11th Doctor is also holding out his arms in a very similar protective gesture, trying to protect the humans they care. Amy and Rory are hugging. Dean stands on the edge of the building, ready to (or already) jumping out.

<br>

can't land the Tardis in 1938 because too much time distortion there, like trying to land a plane in a blizzard, even River couldn't do it. River gets there by Vortex Manipulator, less bulky than a Tardis, a motorbike through traffic (the whole city is time locked, but Cas can fly there)

Dean: "Let me get this straight. You save the universe but only save the UK part, fly across galaxy is close enough but USA is too far away? This isn't your jurisdiction or something?

### draft notes

Dean wrt Amy/Rory: "So you two are married." Cas wrt Doctor/River: "You two are also married." Amy wrt destiel: "And you are --?" Dean: "No, no, we, uh, we are best friends." Amy: "Sure."

## Chap 5 Night In The Statue Park

> (Dean POV)(Act 2 realization)
>
> Dean/Rory try to find exit in Winter Quay, surrounded by angels, back away in corridor, notice familiar angel face (Tessa, Samandriel, Hannah), realize infection pattern (phone call Cas?)

## Chap 6 Calling The Doctor

> (Cas POV)(Act 2 mid-point, moment of truth)
>
> River break wrist (fail to change future), Doctor/River's love talk (River thought not loved back), Cas hear & cure River
>
> Amy use Doctor's device to locate Dean/Rory, 4 of them go save, see room names, split witness old Dean die (Cas uneasy), Amy see old Rory
>
> River/Amy's love talk (Dean/Cas both hear)

### draft notes

Doctor/River: "Why did you lie to me?" "When one's in love with an ageless God who insists on the face of a 12-year-old, one does one's best to hide the damage" "It must hurt. Come here." "Yes. The wrist is pretty bad, too" "That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy. Nothing is gained by you being a sentimental idiot."

River/Amy: "okay, why did you lie?" "Never let him see the damage. And never, ever, let him see you age. He doesn't like endings."

Amy: "Husband, run!" River: "Husband, shut up!" Dean: (swallow) others: (amused, glimpse at Dean/Cas) Dean: (blush)

Reuse River's confession lines when she doesn't recognize 12th Doctor in 《The Husbands of River Song》, loving Doctor is like loving stars themselves, doesn't expect sunset to admire you back (Dean's the same with Cas)

## Chap 7 The Angels Take Manhattan

> (Dean POV)(Act 2 plot point 2+Act 3 twist)
>
> weeping angel besiege attack, all escape to roof, the Statue of Liberty attack, Cas show true form, stare all directions with all eyes, everyone shut eyes (Rory/Amy love talk, Dean/Cas hear), but Cas can't keep doing that, eventually can't maintain true form in this plane
>
> start the paradox talk here (River talk about how it's like to love Doctor, observable, related), get confirm if he dies now he create paradox, Dean already starts considering suicide to save the world (but still a little hesitant), Cas doesn't let him, huge argue
>
> the Statue of Liberty almost touch Dean/Rory, Cas jump in front of him, get turned into statue too, Dean/all stare at him, Cas can't move

### draft notes

(if has to guess, Liberty is Naomi)

Cas buy them time by using all his eyes in his true form to stare at all sculptures all at once so none of them can move again, so the sacrifice is he can't move either (not a solution, so give up)

Dean has to stare at Cas too when Cas is weeping angel. Not blinking, stare save the day

Cas is a "good" weeping angel with them (same as when with normal asshole angels) → deliberately turn off the light and/or close their eyes, and let Cas be free and move, Doctor/etc. freak out, Cas take care of other bad angels, Dean win the bet because he has faith (BAMF Cas)

## Chap 8 Death At Winter Quay

> (Dean POV)(Act 3 climax)
>
> Liberty continue attack, all think no way out, Dean trust Cas, ask them all for faith, look away from Cas for a sec, Cas disappear, Liberty & other statues disappear, Cas move back, still statue
>
> Doctor wants to sonic Cas, Dean furious, think Doctor wants to hurt/destroy him, but actually to link his time energy to call Tardis, can bring them all back to 2012 (but can't cure Cas)
>
> Dean finalizes the decision to suicide to save Cas (hesitant for saving world, determined if it saves Cas)
>
> Dean/Rory argue who to sacrifice, Amy/Rory willing jump together
>
> a few deliberate blink scene sequence, Cas move to him, want to hug but can't, weeping/crying, Dean jump the building
>
> (for a sec make it looks like not working)

### draft notes

Dean's strongest reason to sacrifice instead of Amy/Rory: You have each other, I have no one now. If it doesn't work, try something else, help him, and maybe let my brother know. (give Doctor his phone)

## Chap 9 Last Farewell

> (Dean POV)(Act 3 wrapping up)
>
> timeline reset, everyone back to 2012, Doctor confirm time flux explosion kill most weeping angels, Dean worry about *most* may not include Cas. Not see Cas immediately, Dean panick
>
> Cas finally show up (late bc disoriented), actually weeping (not sculpture) because he overjoy Dean is alive but hate to see him die for him
>
> Doctor/River bicker (book), Amy/Rory resign (farewell), Dean/Cas confession, HE

### draft notes

destiel reunion: hug "Don't do that again" "Same goes for you"
