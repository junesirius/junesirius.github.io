### Locations

#### **Winter Quay**

(apartment block near Battery Park, south end, very close to Statue of Liberty by the shore)

exterior (in script): when looking up at the building from the outside: People are sitting at the windows -- not all of them, but most of them. Just sitting there, quietly looking out. A sense of such despair -- like they're trapped. The various faces -- hollow-eyed, lost, so sad, all of them quite aged. Somehow, just by looking, you can tell they will never leave this place. An old lady staring out. A small girl in a blue silk dress playing peek-a-boo hiding behind her hands.)

apartment interior (in script): A bleak, dusty, characterless apartment. Someone has lived here a very long time. Alone probably. (many items dusty and unused, the old self's breath, ancient and rasping)

(in film): in River's book when Sam Garner walks in : 22 floors, number of rooms in each floor: 0-1st (16), 2-5 (14), 6-14 (12), 15-16 (10), 17-18 (8), 19-20 (6), 21-22 (4), total to 252 rooms; in reality when Rory walks in: 7 floors, number of rooms in each floor: 0 (34), 1 (42), 2 (35), 3 (34), 4 (40), 5 (38), 6 (40), 7 (39), total to 302 rooms (but Rory's room is Floor 8)

### Characters

- The Doctor:
  - "I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings."
  - "Because --" Breaks off. So sad, so defeated. Maybe more defeated than we've ever seen him. He turns to look at the old man in the bed, summons the will to speak. "-- Because he was so pleased to see you again."

- Rory Arthur Williams (Rm. 802 Winter Quay)
  - ancient man lies on the bed. reaching an ancient, withered hand towards Amy. Rory 2 looking up at her, so desperately sad, so terribly old -- "Amy" -- and the lights die in his eyes. His hand slips from hers and he falls back.
  - Tombstone: In loving memory, Rory Arthur Williams, Aged 82

- Amelia Pond
  - Tombstone: And his loving wife, Amelia Williams, Aged 87

- River Song: detective, writer, book 《Melody Malone》(love Doctor and believe not loved back)
  - "She's got ice in her heart and a kiss on her lips, and a vulnerable side she keeps well hidden." -- Amy
  - "Just you wait 'til my husband gets home"
  - after reset: Doctor's wiping down his Tardis with a damp cloth (it's still a bit charred and battered.) River steps into sight next to him. She has a bucket and cloth and is helping him. The Doctor and the Mrs doing the chores.
  - reputation of Melody Malone: the detective who investigates angels
  
- Julius Grayle: crime boss, collector (powerful, wealthy, the Sydney Greenstreet of this world, aging, fleshy, corrupt, sinister)
  - "I want to know if it could feel pain."

- Sam Garner: a private-eye, Bureau of Security and Investigation private investigator (and everything you'd want him to be) (cynical, shrewd, world-weary but in such a Hollywood way) (die in Rm. 702 Winter Quay)
- the locked weeping angel at Grayle's study: scariest, damaged, scarred, emaciated, like it's starving. Its face is feral and ganged, but its mouth is stretched open in what could be a terrible scream of pain, with a length of chain holding it by the wrist and binding it to the wall. The whole thing is framed and lit as if were a beautiful exhibit. It's screaming and the others can hear it.

### Relationships

- Amy: "Husband, run!" River: "Husband, shut up!" Dean: (swallow) Sam: (amused, glimpse at Dean/Cas) Dean: (blush)

#### Doctor/River

- "How did you get your wrist out without braking it?" "You asked, I did. Problem?" "You just changed the future." "**It's called marriage**, honey. Now hush, I'm working. " (On the Doctor -- just a little dazed that she managed to do that. And under that, so happy. Maybe there's hope.) "She's good, her, have you noticed? Really, really good."
- The Doctor now crosses to River. She's sitting on the stairs, trying to not to cradle her wrist. It lies limply across her lap. She's a little stiff, a little frosty -- doesn't like being caught out, and **especially doesn't like being vulnerable**. The Doctor -- very gentle now -- sits next to her. "Why did you lie to me?" "**When one is in love with an ageless god who insists on the face of a twelve year old, one does one's best to hide the damage.**" The Doctor is gently taking River's wrist in his hands. "It must hurt. Come here." "Yes. The wrist is pretty bad too." **He just looks at her, a little pained by that. She can't quite meet his gaze -- like she's ashamed of saying that.** On the Doctor -- a decision. Now on his hand, holding River's wrist. It's glowing, like regeneration. "No! No, stop that, stop that, stop it." He grips his glowing hand round her wrist. The fierce glow envelopes her arm too -- and then snaps off. He kissed her hand. "There we go. How's that?" She glares at him. "Well let's see, shall we." And she uses that hand to slap him hard across the face. "That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy -- nothing is gained by you being a sentimental idiot." "River --" "You *embarrass* me!" "River --" And she gets up, strides to the front door, and slams out. On the Doctor -- what?
- River outside the door, collecting herself. Amy coming through the door -- approaching carefully, as you do on those occasions. A beat. "Okay, so why did you lie?" "**Never let him see the damage. And never, ever, let him see you age. He doesn't like endings.**"
- "You're the woman he loves." "No, I'm not. The Doctor does not and has never loved me. I'm not lying." "You're the woman who loves the Doctor." "Yes, I am. I've never denied it. But **whoever said he loved me back? He's the Doctor. He doesn't go around falling in love with people.** And if you think he's anything that small or that ordinary, then you haven't the first idea of what you're dealing with." "I assure you, she is the perfect bait. This woman is in danger, the Doctor will always come." "You're a moron. No, he won't." "He's probably already here." "No, he isn't. Of course, he isn't. God knows where he is now but I promise you he's doing whatever the hell he wants and not giving a damn about me. And **I'm just fine with that.** **When you love the Doctor, it's like loving the stars themselves. You don't expect a sunset to admire you back.** And if I happen to find myself in danger, let me tell you, **the Doctor is not stupid enough, or sentimental enough, and he is certainly not in love enough to find himself standing in it with me!**" "Hello, sweetie." "You are so doing those roots." "What, the roots of the sunset?" "Don't you dare." "I'll have to check with the stars themselves." "Oh, shut up." (S09E13, after S07E05)
- "What you said to Amy, there's a worse day coming for you?" "When I first met the Doctor, a long, long time ago, he knew all about me. Think about that. Impressionable young girl and suddenly, this man just drops out of the sky. And he's clever and mad and wonderful and knows every last thing about her. Imagine what that does to a girl. Trouble is it's all back-to-front. My past is his future. We're traveling in opposite directions. Every time we meet, I know him more, he knows me less. I live for the days when I see him, but I know that every time I do, he'll be one step further away. And the day is coming when I'll look into that man's eyes, my Doctor, and he won't have the faintest idea who I am. And I think it's going to kill me."(S06E01, before S07E05)
- "**I can't let you die without knowing you are loved, by so many and so much. And by no one more than me.**" (S06E13, before S07E05)

#### Amy/Rory + Doctor/Amy

Rory: "I always wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty. I guess she got impatient." He skips up on the low wall skirting the edge of the building, and turns to face Amy, the city glittering behind him. "You'll *die*." "Yeah, exactly. Twice in the same building on the same night. Who else could do that? This is the right thing to do. This will work. If I die now, it's a paradox, right. The paradox kills the Angels, tell me I'm wrong. Go on, please, 'cos I'm really scared." Amy: says nothing. "Oh, great! The one time you can't manage it!" Rory falters, almost falling, Amy steadies him. He's breathing hard, afraid, struggling to cope with this. He takes Amy's hand, presses against the center of his chest. "Amy... I think I'm going to need a little help here." Amy and Rory, facing each other, her hand still on his chest, his hand holding it there. "Stop it! Just stop it!" "Think it through. This will work, this will kill the Angels." "It'll kill you too." "Will it? River said this place would be erased from time, never exist. If this place never existed, what did I fall off?" "**You think you'll just come back to life?**" "**When don't I?**" "Rory --" "And anyway, what else is there? Dying of old age downstairs, never seeing you again? **Amy, please, if you love me, then trust me, and push.**" "I can't." "You have to." "Could you? **If it was me, could you do it?**" "**To save you, I could do anything.**" On Amy: a decision is reached. She takes Rory's hands, and puts his arms around her. "Prove it." "I can't take you too." "You said we'd come back to life. Money-where-your-mouth-is time." "Amy --" "Shut up. Together. Or not at all." Doctor: "What the hell are you doing?" Rory and Amy don't take their eyes from each other. Amy: "Changing the future. **It's called marriage.**" A breath. And together the step from the edge, toppling over.

Doctor: "Amy!!!" Too late. Now, on Rory and Amy falling, in terrible, tragic slow motion -- still wrapped in each other's arms, turning as they fall. Pushing closer on the Doctor -- like it's his worst ever moment. "Amy!! Amy!!" And then -- silence. And then -- screams from below, cars swerving horns blaring. On the Doctor and River: Frozen, listening. Just goes on and on, worse and worse. Then -- a crackle of energy, energy-like lightning flashing over the face of the Statue of Liberty, and engulfing the roof. The whole building now glowing around them. The whole place shaking now, glowing fiercer and fiercer. **And the Doctor is *grinning*.**

#### Doctor/Amy

"Amy, please, just come back into the Tardis. Come along, Pond, please." Amy considers that, tears streaming. The Doctor now takes her hand. **Imploring. A direct, naked appeal.** Amy: resolved. She pulls her hand from his. On the Doctor: it's like this action has a physical impact on him, *hurts* him. "Raggedy man..." and she swings round to face him, her body now obscuring the Angel behind her. "Goodbye!" And she vanishes -- the Angel revealed behind her, its hand extended in the time-zapping position. "No..." The Doctor -- just shock. She's gone. Really, really gone.; River flying the Tardis. The Doctor slumped on the stairs, lost in his darkest thoughts. He's trying to pull himself out of them.

#### Blurb at the back cover

Melody Malone

A private detective in old town New York

New York Growled at my window. A friend once told this was the town of a million stories.

Some nights I felt like they were all happening to me. This was one of those nights.

But what the hell -- my stocking seams were straight, my lipstick was combat ready, and I was packing cleavage that could fell an ox at twenty feet.

### Music BGM

"Englishman in New York" by Sting

## Theory

### Original settings

#### Weeping Angels

- "People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff." (DW310) (Dean: "That's just so English")
- "Fascinating race, the weeping angels. The only psychopath in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death, the rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye. You die in the past and in the present, they consume the energy of all the days you might have had. All your stolen moments. They're creatures of the abstract, they live off *potential* energy." (DW310) ("timey-wimey detector" Dean: I made a better hand-made EMF than that when I was ten.)
- "creatures from another world" "The Lonely Assassins, they used to be called. No one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the universe, or very nearly. And they have survived this long because they have the most perfect defense system ever evolved. They're quantum locked. They don't exist when they're being observed. The moment they're seen by any other living creature, they freeze into rock. No choice, it's a fact of their biology. In the sight of any living thing, they literally turn to stone. And you can't kill a stone. 'Course, a stone can't kill you either, but then you turn your head away. Then you blink. And, oh yes it can. (Don't take your eyes off that) That's why they cover their eyes. They're not weeping, they can't risk looking at each other. Their greatest asset is their greatest curse. They can never be seen. Loneliest creatures in the universe." "Your life could depend on this. Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They're fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away and don't blink." (DW310)
- A weeping angel, is the deadliest, most powerful, most malevolent life form evolution has ever produced. The weeping angels can only move if they're unseen. It's quantum lock. In the sight of any living creature, the angels literally cease to exist. They're just stone. The ultimate defence mechanism. Being a stone, until you turn your back. That which holds the image of an angel becomes itself an angel. The eyes are not the windows of the soul, they are the doors. Beware what may enter there. (DW604)

#### Paradox

- About paradox: "If Rory got out, it would create a paradox. This is the Angels' food source. The paradox poisons the well. It could kill them all. This whole place would literally *un*happen." "It would be almost impossible." "Loving the almost." "But to create a paradox like that, it takes almost unimaginable power. What have we got? Tell me, come on, what?" A silence. Then Amy reaches for Rory's hand takes it. "**I won't let them take him. That's what we've got.**" "Rory, even if you got out, you'd have to keep running for the rest of your life. They would be chasing you *forever*." "Well then. Better get started."
- After reset: "You collapsed the timeline, the paradox worked; we are pinged back where we belong." "What, in a graveyard?" "This happened the last time. Why always here?" "Does it matter? We got lucky; we could have blown New York off the planet. I can't ever take the Tardis back there, the timelines are too scrambled. I could have lost you both. Don't ever do that again." And he folds them both into the biggest hug. "What did we do? We *fixed* it, we solved the problem, --" "I was talking to myself." And kisses them both on the head.

#### Plot setting

"Displacing someone back in time, creates time energy, and that's what the Angels feed on. But normally it's a one-off -- a hit and run. If they could keep hold of their victims, feed off their time energy over and over again... This place is a farm. A battery farm. (Rounds on River) How many Angels in New York?" "It's like they've taken over every status in the city." "The *Angels* take Manhattan! Because they can, because they've never had a food source like this one. The city that never sleeps."

### Crossover settings

weeping angel is a kind of angel disease, purgatory virus, leviathan triggered

angels invading purgatory to save Cas, get infected, become mutated angels

petrify to sculpture shape with uncontrollable time travel ability and quantum-lock, can't move if stared at

spread infection by touching other angels

human get touched get zapped back in time

angels can feel pain, can laugh, can scream, others can hear

can be locked by iron handcuff

the tortured angel in Grayle's house is Hael, the mother-son statues are Mirabel and Samandriel, the Angel of Water is Hannah, the gatekeeper angels of Winter Quay are Inias and Hannah (how Dean recognize), the alcove angel inside Winter Quay that caged Dean is Tessa (also how he recognize)

why infected/weeping angel sends people back/touch them: (Cas's theory) maybe not to harm them, but asking for help, angels have instinct to heal by touch, so they're looking for touch to self-cure, or they're too lonely, so they capture these humans to keep themselves accompany; (Doctor's theory) they feed on time energy, they capture these human for food source; (Dean's theory) they're and they've always been bastards, so they're just continuing being bastards, want to feed *and* attract more angels and hunters over, so they can spread the disease and get more food; or that's the karma for them, about time they pay for being assholes all these times (which pains Cas to think any of them deserve this bc he can hear the angels' screaming of pain even if they're not really alive as stones)

are statues always infected angels or are angels trapped inside statues: statues are always how these angels get cursed to look like when they are infected and drop into the timeline right when the statue is built, e.g. Naomi get infected and become Liberty and get sent and dropped on Earth in 1886

## Outline

### Ideas

Cas is infected when trying to save people (Winchesters/Ponds), self-sacrifice

Doctor/River save destiel, destiel save Amy/Rory

Doctor want to kill weeping Cas and stopped by Dean

Cas is a "good" weeping angel with them → deliberately turn off the light and/or close their eyes, and let Cas be free and move, Doctor/etc. freak out, Cas take care of other bad angels, Dean win the bet because he has faith (BAMF Cas)

Cas buy them time by using all his eyes in his true form to stare at all sculptures all at once so none of them can move again, so the sacrifice is he can't move either (not a solution, so give up)

Dean has to stare at Cas too when Cas is weeping angel. Not blinking, stare save the day

~~put Amy/Rory in background but not emphasize? otherwise three pairs in focus, too many people? don't reverse Amy/Rory's glorious heartbreaking grand exit? death means something, that's the only way to make life mean something → what's written in stone is unchangeable, creating another paradox will rip the universe apart~~

Dean: "Let me get this straight. You save the universe but only save the UK part, fly across galaxy is close enough but USA is too far away? This isn't your jurisdiction or something? Pal, not I'm saying, you did a terrible job in protecting the earth, in case you didn't notice, it at least trashed twice if we didn't ..." Doctor: "All due respect, who's behind that? Also, USA almost trashed twice doesn't mean..." River: "Don't mind him, London gets trashed every Christmas, it's a Doctor and Monster thing." Dean/Cas: "You can say that again."

Dean distrust Doctor at first: "What? I'm supposed to just trust him like that? He's an alien with two hearts!" Cas: "I'm a celestial being with too many eyes and no body." Dean choked: "Which side are you?"

why angels go to Purgatory to save Cas: canon way, Naomi ordered, think Cas useful, want to brainwash him; why didn't brainwash: Cas fights and escapes, run away before they can find him, so best not to use his mojo/fly so he won't be found by the angels → but end up still use his power to save those people he cared

witty comments about how come the cheapest hotel sounds like 5-star penthouse; you can't live in anywhere too far away from any landscape in Manhattan; comments about American & English & Scottish accent

Doctor: "Don't blink, don't look them in the eyes" Dean: "What's wrong with their eyes" Amy: "Trust me, you don't want to know."

### Plot (early draft)

Dean back from Purgatory through portal, Cas back later saved by angels (remembered angel's war, concerned, not brainwashed ← important hint) (Sam with Amelia, undisturbed)

Dean&Cas find case in Manhattan: statue moving, people disappearing & sudden aging, tomb with wrong dates (death earlier than birth) → go investigate

Dean&Cas first notice Rory zapped away, run into Doctor/Amy (self-intros, Doctor/Cas discuss time flux), Doctor has River's book (mentioned Dean/Cas sacrifice+Amy/Rory farewell (keep it vague), River's broken wrist, gives specific time location), Cas fly 4 of them to 1938, too many weeping angels there, everyone in danger, Cas power limited because of all the angel/temporal energy

Dean/Amy volunteer to check Rory, Dean protect Amy & zapped away to Winter Quay, meet Rory; Dean/Rory try to find exit, surrounded by angels, back away in corridor, notice familiar angel face (<u>Tessa 201</u>, <u>*Inias 721*</u>, <u>*Samandriel 802*</u>, Ion 821, Nathaniel 823, <u>Hael 901</u>, Bartholomew 903, ~~Ingrid 908~~, Malachi 909, Theo 909, Azrael 909, Sophia 909, *Ezekiel 909*, <u>*Hannah 918*</u>, Neil 923, Ambriel 1110, ~~Ishim 1210~~, Benjamin 1210, <u>Mirabel 1210</u>, Kelvin 1215, Hozai 1219, ~~Dumah 1307~~, ~~Indra 1319~~), realize infection pattern

River break wrist (fail to change future), Doctor/River's love talk (River thought not loved back), Cas hear & cure River; Amy use Doctor's device to locate Dean/Rory, 4 of them go save, see room names, all witness old Dean die (Cas uneasy); River/Amy's love talk (Dean/Cas both hear)

weeping angel besiege attack, all escape to roof, Statue of Liberty attack, Cas show true form, stare all directions with all eyes, everyone shut eyes (Rory/Amy love talk, Dean/Cas hear), but Cas can't keep doing that, eventually can't maintain true form in this plane; Statue of Liberty almost touch Dean/Rory, Cas jump in front of him, get turned into statue too, Dean/all stare at him, Cas can't move

Liberty continue attack, all think no way out, Dean trust Cas, ask them for all faith, look away from Cas for a sec, Cas disappear, Liberty & other statues disappear, Cas move back, still statue

Doctor wants to sonic beam Cas, Dean furious, think Doctor wants to hurt/destroy him, but actually to link his time energy to call Tardis, can bring them all back to 2012; Dean ask River about paradox (River talk about how it's like to love Doctor, observable, related), get confirm if he dies now he create paradox, maybe can save Cas; a few deliberate blink scene sequence, Cas move to him, want to hug but can't, weeping/crying, Dean jump the building

timeline reset, everyone back to 2012, Doctor confirm time flux explosion kill most weeping angels, Dean worry about *most* may not include Cas, but Cas show up, actually weeping (not sculpture) because he overjoy Dean is alive but hate to see him die for him; Doctor/River bicker (book), Amy/Rory resign (farewell), Dean/Cas confession, HE

Canon-divergent to both SPN and DW, post-Purgatory before SPN S08E01 and closely follow plotline in DW S07E05, Dean and Cas come back to Earth after Purgatory, notice people missing and things weird in Manhattan, think it's a case, they go there investigating. They run into Doctor and Amy, find out Rory is the latest victim who gets zapped to the past, and weeping angel is the cause/monster. They fly back in time to 1938 to fix the problem and save people, only to find actually weeping angel sculptures are angels infected by Purgatory disease. The whole Manhattan in 1938 is in danger. All six of them have to find a way to fix the angels and humans and save the world together. There are a lot of sacrifices and realizations, the relationships between Doctor/River and Amy/Rory are very educational and relatable for Cas/Dean.

### Visual Element

On the roof of a very tall building, Cas is a weeping angel sculpture, his wings spread out all big and wide in a protective posture, protecting Dean Amy Rory from a very terrifying, huge, overwhelming Statue of Liberty that's threatening and attacking them. The 11th Doctor is also holding out his arms in a very similar protective gesture, trying to protect the humans they care. Amy and Rory are hugging. Dean stands on the edge of the building, ready to (or already) jumping out.

### Author's notes before the story

(first paragraph: usual appreciation for the bang and artist)

This story is heavily inspired by and adapted from Doctor Who's S07E05 episode with the same title, many of the scenes are heavily rewritten from the show because the original storytelling is so astonishing as is. Many quotes as well. Anything I'm not doing right is probably my bad, and most of the brilliant settings and story ideas should credit to the original show creators and production teams.

The music that accompanies the creation of this story is Sting's 1987 song "English man in New York," also used in the original show.

## Editing notes

Chap.4: the bickers might be too lightheaded? situation is urgent, Amy should be really worried about Rory, less joke and less laugh

Chap.4: double check the change of relationship between every character, how do they change from untrusted strangers to acquittance/friends

sonic screwdriver: green light, not blue

when posting: Chap.4/7's Act 1/2 post as separate chapters on AO3

> (The Detective is actually Dean?)

Rain pours down the city, soaking the buildings and the statues in gloomy coldness. The night is deep, but the city is still awake. Lights glittering in every window and lining the streets. A city that never sleeps.

Thunders roar from the distance, water streaming down the face of two statues standing across the street from a grand mansion. The statue of a woman holding the hand of a little boy. Light is extraordinarily bright in the building, seeping out from the windows to light up the stretches of the road in front of it like day time, shining on the faces of the statues. A man stands behind the window, gazing at the night street, biting his cigar.

The Detective hurries toward the glamorous building. The black umbrella barely has a chance against the storm. A carriage passes by on the street, water puddles splashing under the horse's hoofs.

The giant door opens slowly with numerous tedious clicks of locks unbuckling, opening to a slit merely wide enough for the Detective to pass through sideways. Eyes of two guards in fine suits and hats peer through the opening, glancing at the night outside warily. The door is closed tightly immediately after.

"Detective," the man turns from the window, holding a hand toward his new guest, "Julius Grayle." He greets with a pretentious nod.

"Honor." The Detective gives a short nod as reply, not taking his hand. "Every man and woman in New York knows your name, Mr. Grayle."

Grayle turns to the window, smoking his cigar. His reflection looks behind him on the bright window glass. "So are you, Detective, I heard you are the best investigator in Manhattan. So, will you take the case?"

"Sure. Why not?" The Detective smirks an amused smile.

"Because you don't believe me." The man waves a hand casually, not shifting his eyes. The mother and son statues are barely visibly in the downpour from across the street now. The night is even darker by each passing minute.

The guards read his gesture and bring forth a leather briefcase, opening it on the luxurious study desk. Fresh bills bundled neatly inside.

The Detective glances at the display, looking back at the reflection of the man. "For that as payment plus expenses? I'll believe any damn thing you say."

"But you don't believe that statues can move." Grayle finally takes his gaze away from the window, turning round, studying his guest's face.

The Detective says nothing.

"You're right, Detective. They can't. Of course they can't... " Grayle pauses a beat meaningfully, "... when you're looking."

The Detective just eyes him, then, "Whatever it is, I'm sure there is an explanation."

"I'm counting on that." Grayle grins a humorless smile. "Good night, Detective. And good luck." He nods at the guards and turns back to the window. His look is troubled now, frowning at the night street outside.

The Detective picks up the cash from the desk, puts on the hat and coat, and follows one of Grayle's men out.

Across the street, light leaking from the mansion shines on the place where the statues were. Rain pours down on the empty plinth, wetting the stone.

<br>

The address written on the back of the business card Grayle left on top of the briefcase is an apartment building several blocks away, near Battery Park. Statues stand crowdedly among the trees in the park and near the building, leaving shadows like living beings under the night sky. The red neon sign on top of the building reads "Winter Quay."

The Detective walks up the steps leading to the building's entrance, and pauses midway, glancing at the flanking statues on the two sides uneasily. They are big weeping angel sculptures, wings closed on the back, hands covering the faces, water streaming down their fingers like tears.

The rain is relentless, and the air is prickling, leaving the kind of feeling that one is watched silently for each step from behind.

The building is tall, steeping among Manhattan's forest of skyscrapers. Most of the windows are open on the tall floors regardless of the drencher, some of the lower levels' too.

The Detective glances at the windows, meeting the eyes of a young girl in blue dress. The girl stands alone by the window, wind flowing her dress and hair in all directions. She covers her face in her palms, closing her eyes, then suddenly looking out from behind her hands. Her lips mummer some words that The Detective cannot hear, a warning or just a playful "peek-a-boo" no one would ever know.

Next to her window, an old lady stares out. Her eyes are hollowed, lost focus, and so, so sad just by the look of them. Next to hers, is another aged men, the same tired, lifeless look. Then more of the same. All aged, all quiet, all defeated. The look of trapped and lost.

The Detective shifts the gaze uncomfortably, moving to walk up the remaining steps. The doors open automatically at the newcomer's approach, swinging slowly back on their own. The Detective hesitates at the threshold, eyeing the inside warily.

The street light shines into the hallway, showing a grand but deserted space. The metal sign by the empty elevator well is rusty, the letters noting the number of rooms on each floor are shallow and dusty, looking as aged as the residents peeping out from the windows.

The elevator well is old-styled, with hollow metal structure like a half-finished construction site. The Detective approaches it cautiously, one hand resting close to the back of the belt where the pistol is.

"Hello?" The Detective voices carefully, then almost startles at a sudden loud sound of clanking noise. The sound echoes in the empty space.

An ancient elevator wheezes its way down to the ground level, the metal door squeaks open.

Looking up, there is no showing who -- or what -- might have sent it down, The Detective steps in the cramped space hesitantly. The door rattles behind.

There is no button or handle to indicate which floor to go to. The elevator clanks into life, rising on its own accord.

The Detective turns around inside the elevator, startled again. The weeping angel statue that was outside the building, is now standing exactly where the human was moments ago, facing the elevator. Its face cupped in its hands, its wings spread open.

"What the hell?" The Detective gasps.

The lift rises beyond the first floor, blocking the view of the statue shortly.

<br>

The floor it stops at looks like a luxurious hotel floor, with crimson velvet carpet layering on the corridor. The lights on the ceiling flicker occasionally, as dim as candlelight. The long, bleak corridor is quiet, with doors and rooms on each side. A weeping angel statue sits at the end of the corridor inside an alcove, hands covering its face, head lowered in a humble, solemn pose.

The Detective steps down the corridor carefully, glancing at either side. Some doors are closed, some open. Behind each open door, there is an empty small room to live in. And on each closed one, there is a number and a name tag.

The Detective checks the names on the doors, slowly, one by one, until stops dead at one closed door -- with the familiar name of his own.

The unlocked door is easily pushed open. The Detective knocks on it as he enters, "Hello, anyone home?"

The small apartment room has a narrow, dusty doorway, as bleak and ancient as the rest of the building. But with a small hint of someone has been living here, probably alone, probably a very long time.

The cloth rack by the door has a hat and coat hanging on it. A tall, black gentleman hat, and a long suit coat, exactly like the ones The Detective is wearing, though much older. He touches his own coat self-consciously, moving down the doorway with more unease by each step.

Lying on the shelf next to the coat rack, a leather briefcase. Dusty and unused. Exactly the same as the one in his grasp right now.

The Detective frowns deeply, putting down the one he's holding on the floor, opening the one in front of him. He drops it in a gasp -- the neatly bundled cash lies inside, with a handwritten card reading "Winter Quay" in fading ink on the very top.

His heart pounds fast. He reaches for his own briefcase, almost ready to dash for the door, only to be stopped by a weak sound behind him. A voice that sounds like a moan or a whimper.

The door leads to a bedroom, cramped and bleak, with only a bed in the center and barely anything else.

The Detective can't help himself crossing into the room.

The old man lying in the bed must be in his nineties, his breath ancient and withered, like the last leaf on a winter tree.

"Who are you?" The Detective approaches the bed, curiosity and horror taking over the action.

The old man's eyes flicker open, staring at the his bedside visitor with dead fish's eyes, his voice croaked for lack of use: "Run! Run! They're coming for you! They'll send you back!"

"Who's coming? Back where?" The Detective is alarmed. The light in the room and in the corridor flickers harder. There is long stretch of dark moments between lights. A loud stomping sound pounds on the ground from far distance.

"In time! Back in time!" the old man struggles hard, rising his upper body to clutch on The Detective's arm, gasping urgently, "I'm you! *I'm you!!*"

Then his struggle stops abruptly. His movement falls still. He closes his eyes as the last strength is drawn out. A last breath is rattled from his throat, and then there is no more.

Freaked out, The Detective glares at the body in the bed, stumbles a few steps back, and flees toward the door.

He races out of the apartment as fast as he can, only to halt abruptly as he sees the weeping angel statue that was in the alcove has left its place. The hands are lowered, the face with hollow eye sockets facing him, one hand reaching out to him like an invitation, undoubtedly trying to touch.

The Detective rushes to the opposite way. The elevator sighs a stop, the doors clattering open, and inside the lift, the weeping angel that was outside the building stands straight, hands reaching out, mouth open, showing sharp, ugly fangs.

The Detective's mouth agape, "What the --"

He stirs around, only to find the one from the alcove has moved forward, standing still halfway down the corridor. Looks back to the elevator, the other statue is outside the lift now.

The Detective desperately turns around, looking for a way out. Only then does he notice the green emergency sign over his head marking "Exit" with an arrow pointing at the door behind him. And thank god, that door marks "Stairs."

He throws himself through it. The corridor light dies at the same moment.

The emergency light wakes in the stairwell, leaving weak green patches of light and shadows. The Detective lunges for the downward stairs, but shadows of two statues are already there, frozen as he stares at them. He glances upward then blinks down, those two shadows are already around the corner. The arms of the statues reaching out in an attacking pose.

The Detective races up the stairs without looking back.

<br>

He bounds up the stairs for his dear life, slamming the stairwell door the moment he reaches the rooftop, blocking it with some scattered iron bars he finds on the floor.

The rooftop is high above the ground, the light from top of Chrysler Building looks only a short distance away. This sleepless city has flowing lights in the skyline and on the street, but at this moment, to his horror, the whole city's light blinks. And in each brief moment of darkness, the loud crashing sound shakes the earth. The sound of something giant stomping on the ground, moving closer step by step.

WHOMP!

The city's light blinks.

WHOMP!

The building shakes.

WHOMP!

The sound comes from directly behind. The Detective turns around slowly.

The giant shadow of a massive statue falls on him. Its face over the far edge of the rooftop, its mouth wide open. A torch in her right hand.

The Detective gasps in horror and total disbelief: "You gotta be kiddin' me!"

<br>

## Chap 2 Missing In New York

> (Dean POV)(Act 1 setup)
>
> Dean back from Purgatory through portal, Cas back later saved by angels (remembered angel's war, concerned, not brainwashed ← important hint; why not: escaped) (Sam with Amelia, undisturbed) ← passing lines in chat
>
> Dean&Cas find case in Manhattan: statue moving, people disappearing & sudden aging, tomb with wrong dates (death earlier than birth) → go investigate
>
> find River's book in their motel, Cas read, find their own name/alias/mention in the story, goes to the place book says they will be

Birds chatter noisily around the tables, chirping cheerfully while fighting for the food crumbs on the ground. Apparently the chilliness of early autumn in the city is not enough to keep them quiet or away, neither is the man sitting by the table, protecting his French fries from these thieves.

Dean shoos at the birds, waving a hand aggressively, trying to keep his meal as safe as he can.

"Maybe if you feed them some, they'd just leave," Cas says from the other side of the table, not looking up from the book he's reading.

"No, then they'd just all come asking for a piece and I don't have anything left to eat!" Dean takes a large bite on the French fries in his hand, chewing as if for revenge. "Look at them, that must be how they end up all glossy and fleshy, I don't think I've ever seen pigeons in any other place rounder than them."

Cas looks up to observe the pigeons at his words, agreeing with a quiet hum. The pigeons are indeed looking very healthy and well-fed. He looks back at his book, turning a page.

"Man, I'm telling you, New York, even the pigeons are richer." Dean grins.

"I'm not sure that's true," Cas answers with a serious face. "There are poor people in this city."

Dean barks a laugh. "It's good to have you back, Cas. Speaking of, how do you feel? You know, after Purgatory puke me out, I'm still getting use to my sea legs. It's only been, what, a week?"

Cas keeps his eyes on the book, his shoulders stiffen a little, voice quieter. "I feel fine. And if you don't mind, I'd rather *not* think about the angels that have to siege the Purgatory to save me -- against my will -- and I have to, *again*, fight them off to run away. I already tried my best to not harm any more of them, but I think some of them are still hurt because of me, some are even my friends. If it's not for me, Inias and Hannah wouldn't ever be in the Purgatory, I didn't even have time to check if they survived the incursion. And there are more that didn't --"

"That's not your fault, you know that, right, Cas?" Dean lowers his voice too, glancing around, more self-aware now that they are in the middle of a sea of ordinary human. "It's a good thing you get to run away before that Naomi bitch can do anything to you, whatever she has in mind. Let's keep it that way."

Cas gives a small nod in agreement, his shoulders slack.

"Now let me just finish my food and we'll get back to work." Dean swallows down the food, and takes another exaggeratedly huge bite on the burger, sighing with satisfaction.

Cas glances at him with a small smile.

"Miss the food and everything." Dean talks with food in his mouth, gesturing their surroundings, "Not like Purgatory has any Michelin stars or anything."

Sunlight shines on the shade above their table, bright color glittering through the leaves. The diner's outdoor seating is already over busy and crowded even though it's way earlier than usual lunch hour. The street is jammed with vehicles of all kinds, cars and buses and pedestrians moving in all directions. It seems this city is just soaked with life at every possible space, at any time.

"Maybe we can come here more often if you like it so much," Cas offers. "Not only when there are cases."

"Nah, big towns aren't really our thing," Dean dismisses, stuffing down the rest of the burger, licking his fingers for the last bit taste of fries and salt. "There is a reason we don't go to big name places like Los Angeles or New York. The loose ends can bite."

Cas nods quietly. "I understand."

Dean wipes his mouth as he finishes, and throws the used paper napkin on the plate, "Now, where are we?"

Cas blinks, "We are in the Josie's Burger near Central Park."

Dean tries to muffle the laugh and sigh that are fighting in his throat. "Yes, we are. I mean where are we on the case?"

"Same as last night," Cas pulls out a piece of newspaper folded between the book pages, spreading it on the least oily corner of the table. The missing people notice takes half the page, and the page after that shows a photo of some local cemetery. The title reads "Death Earlier Than Birth."

"That sure is an eye-catching title, I'll give you that," Dean nods at the flourishing inky letters, turning the paper one hundred and eighty degrees so he doesn't need to read upside down, "How many missing people so far?"

"Ten until yesterday, we don't know if there are more in the past twenty four hours." Cas answers.

"The earliest missing is a week ago." Dean checks the handwritten notes on the margin. They have managed to do some digging, but not enough to connect the dots yet.

"About the same time when I came back." Cas says what's in both their minds.

"You thinking what I'm thinking?" Dean says. Their eyes meet.

"That angels have something to do with that?" Cas frowns.

"Possible, cemetery and death stuff, could be your department. I can't see any connections between the victims. You got anything about the tombs and statues?"

"Reports said some statues move the places or poses, and the dates on some of the tombs are obviously wrong. The police found three new tombs with the missing people's names on it, but the dates of death are earlier than their dates of birth, therefore 'Death earlier than birth'."

"People with the same names?" Dean suggests.

"Three pairs of people with same names? Too much coincidences, don't you think?" Cas narrows his eyes.

"New York is a big city," Dean shrugs, though he doesn't buy the theory either. Since when do they have the luck that things are *just coincidence* anyway.

"So what should we do?" Cas asks, his fingers absently fidgeting the corner of the book. "Shall we call Sam?"

"Nah, we can handle it without him." Dean's face is unreadable for a moment. "He got what he wanted, an apple-pie life with a pretty woman, don't think I can do it again to rob him from that kind of life. He'd probably just punch me in the face if I show up on his doorsteps of his white-fence house."

"Dean, I don't think --"

"Cas." Dean doesn't let him finish, giving him a stern look that means "drop the topic," Cas falls silent. 

"He made his choice." Dean keeps his voice cold and steady, "For once, I'm respecting that. It's just you and me now."

Cas sighs, grabbing the book and ready to stand up from the diner seat. "Alright. Where are we going next?"

"To the cemetery -- want to check out those tombs first. Maybe we can find something the police missed. Ask around the victim's family later -- routine questions." Dean stands up, straightening his FBI suit, gesturing for Cas to follow. "Only a few blocks away, we can cross the Central Park. Come on."

They walk out of the diner, merging into the ocean of pedestrians on the streets.

Dean leans closer to avoid them getting separated by the crowd.

Cas tucks the book under his arm.

Dean regards his move closely when their elbows bump, looking him up and down, then landing his gaze on the book, as if he only starts to notice it now. "Where did you get that book?"

"What, this one?" Cas follows his gaze, flipping the book over to show him the cover. The title reads "Melody Malone," with a drawing of a sexy lady detective in a sheathy leather jacket, her face hidden in the shadow of a large detective hat, only showing red lips kissing a smoking gun.

"I like the cover," Dean comments with a small smile, taking the book and skimming random pages, "looks like some old-time detective novel."

"Yes, it is. It's a rather intriguing story about a private detective in old town New York." Cas confirms. "I found it in the motel drawer."

Dean turns to the back cover, reading out: "New York growled at my window. A friend once told this was the town of a million stories.

"Some nights I felt like they were all happening to me. This was one of those nights.

"But what the hell -- my stocking seams were straight, my lipstick was combat ready, and I was packing cleavage that could fell an ox at twenty feet."

He looks up from the blurb, amused, "Whoever wrote this, I like her. 'Packing cleavage that could fell an ox at twenty feet!' Look at that!"

Some passers-by glance at them with curious eyes, probably overhearing the last bit.

Cas lowers his voice, "Why do you read it out?"

"I don't know, why do you read it at all?" Dean thumbs the pages casually, eyes gleaming with mischief.

"I thought it's a tour guide or something, maybe it can help us know more about New York or the case." Cas admits.

But Dean has stopped listening. He slowly straightens his back, grabbing the opened page with too much force on the knuckles. His eyes focus dead on the page. His steps frozen.

Cas drags him off the street, leading them onto a smaller road quiet enough to talk.

"What is it, Dean?" Cas hurries in his most worried voice.

Dean reads out the lines he's staring at: "A handsome young man walks into the room, flashing a clearly fake FBI badge before our eyes, saying with probably his most persuasive, charming smile, 'I'm Agent Plant. This is my partner, Agent Page.'

"The man next to him in raggedy trench coat has the bluest eyes I've ever seen, and he looks like barely survived a blast. He pulls out a similar badge from his suit, displaying it upside down.

"The first man sighs and corrects it for him, and the second man murmurs some words that are actually loud enough for us to hear: 'Is it really necessary, Dean?'

"And Dean answers with another sigh: 'Not really, 'cause I read from the book they already knew it's fake.'"

<br>

## Chap 3 Taking The Case

> (Dean POV)(Act 1 inciting incident)
>
> Dean&Cas first notice Rory zapped away, run into weeping angel first-hand for the first time

They stare at each other, eyes wide with disbelief and -- if Dean's honest with himself -- a little bit of horror.

"How's that possible?" Dean gasps and rereads the paragraph.

He reaches inside his suit pocket for the badge, which he already knew without really needing to double-check would show "Agent Plant," as well as Cas's would be "Agent Page."

"How can we possibly appear in a book that you found in a random motel drawer, that's probably been there forever?" Dean stares at Cas unbelievably, shaking his head. His fingers turn the book to the next page, just about to read what's next, when Cas suddenly grabs the book from him, slamming the pages shut.

"No, Dean! We can't read anymore." Cas clutches the book's spine hard. "I think -- I wish I'm wrong -- but I think time travel is involved here. The book might have the past that is going to be our future. We can't read early."

"But maybe it can help us save those missing people, solve the mystery?" Dean raises his eyebrows, "It might have all the answers we are looking for."

"And if we read and find you're dead?" Cas's voice turns harsh.

Dean swallows, but he doesn't back down, "Then we change it. We change the time and fate and everything all the time. Remember Titanic?"

Cas snorts a self-mockery laugh, "Exactly, and see how that turns out."

"But you fixed it." Dean pats him on the shoulder encouragingly, "I'm sure we can figure something out too this time even if the worst comes."

Cas lowers his head, "I just don't want to make any more mistakes. Can we at least take it slowly? Maybe only read when we absolutely have to."

Dean thinks about that, "Alright, don't ever say I never listen to you. Right now, how about we stick to the plan?"

They emerge back to the busy 72nd St., heading to Central Park.

<br>

The hustle and bustle of the city is blocked out the moment they walk into the green space of Central Park. Ten minutes in, and they almost forget they are still in the middle of the most abustle cities in the world.

People are jogging, or running, or walking dogs. In a plaza, a group of opera singers are rehearsing maybe some grand performances in the future. Artists set up sketch stands by the roadside, painting the view onto white papers. Tourists with heavy backpacks take photos of everything -- pinecones falling from the trees, commemorative sculptures of historical figures, cute dogs passing by, landmarks of the city. With the tree crowns covering the sky, even the highest skyscrapers of Manhattan is out of view.

Dean sniffs the air long and slow.

The air smells green and fresh.

"Do you sometimes think nothing bad can happen in places like this?" Dean can't help asking. "It's like, places like this are too bright and happy to be intruded by dark, nasty monsters. Monsters are in caves and undergrounds, the dark places under the bed or in closets, they'd never come to beautiful sunshine places like this."

"I certainly hope that is true." Cas nods.

They walk past the crowds, taking a short cut through the underpass in Bethesda Terrace. The fountain splashes under the bright sun, an angel statue standing on the very top. Not many people around the fountain today, only a couple of old people strolling slowly. A busker is singing some beautiful folk songs with a weathered guitar. Cas leaves a twenty dollar bill in his opened guitar box.

"That's Hannah," Cas points at the angel statue on the fountain when they pass it. "I know her."

"What, really? A real angel?" Dean takes a second look at the statue. The female figure looks more human than any angel he came to know in the past few years, wearing a long silky robe instead of in any suits. A pair of wings stretch elegantly from her shoulder blades. She looks down at people passing by the fountain with a look of compassionate tenderness.

"No harp or halo?" Dean jokes.

Cas's eyes are still on the static statue, as if he's looking at something *inside* the statue that Dean can't see. "Not her true form, but the statue, that's for Angel of Water. And water is her charge. I think I can even hear her just from the statue, maybe it's the water singing."

"And those are her children?" Dean points at the four small baby angels around the base of the fountain.

"The cherubs?" Cas shifts his attention to those chubby little statues, "No, she doesn't have any children. Those are just human imagination of what cherubs look like -- wrong as always -- they are not impotent babies wearing diapers, much like cupids."

"Yeah I remember that naked dude two, three years ago." Dean chuckles at the memory.

"They're good arts with nice names, nonetheless." Cas tilts his head, examining them carefully.

"They have names?" Dean asks curiously.

"Of course they do. You humans have a habit of naming everything." Cas answers casually. "They are Peace, Health, Purity, and Temperance."

"Like dogs. I get it." Dean nudges him gently. "Come on, let's keep moving."

Cas follows him, but he glances back shortly again. "For some reason I think they're alive." He frowns lightly, a little confused.

"What, like the statues are talking to you?" Dean eyes him from the side.

"More like giggling. Are you sure you can't hear anything?"

Dean listens carefully for a moment. "Nope, only the dude singing -- nice voice there." He nods at the busker. "But nothing angelic."

A man walks past them, holding three coffees in his hands, struggling to keep balance.

Cas looks back at the cherubs one more time, and he stops his steps.

"Oh come on, you have eyes on your back or something?" Dean stops too, turning around when he finds Cas didn't keep up.

"I have eyes in all directions, but not on this vessel's back." Cas answers seriously, his frown deepens. "Dean, look."

That's Cas's "there is something seriously wrong here" voice.

Dean is on guard immediately. "What is it?"

"The cherubs, they are gone."

Cas is right. The base of the fountain is bare now. The Angel of Water -- Hannah -- on top of the fountain stays standing, water spouting from the top and arching into the pool below, but the place where the four cherub statues were, it's empty now.

"Okay, weird." Dean says slowly, moving in the trained scouting gait, stepping up trying to take a closer look at the statue.

"Wait, Dean." Cas grabs his arms before he can take another step, "Something else is wrong --"

Dean meets his eyes, suddenly nervous and alarmed by his tone. Their pupils shrink. It's so quiet he can almost hear his own breathing.

Dean whispers, "Since when did the music stop?"

They snap their heads toward the busker. The place only has a lone guitar box on the ground.

"He's gone." Cas says.

"Yeah I can see that." Dean steps back slowly, away from the fountain, swallowing hard. "What the hell's happening?"

A distorted giggling sound echoes from behind them, together with some tiny little patters.

Dean swallows, "Please tell me I'm hallucinating, but does that sound like tiny stone babies running and laughing to you?"

Cas meets his eyes, nodding. "That's what I heard earlier."

"Hello? Did you hear anything?" A man asks behind them. Dean almost jumps.

"Jesus!" He turns around sharply, his hands reflexively pull his pistol from the belt, finger on the trigger. Dean lowers the gun when he sees the person talking. It's the same guy passing them minutes ago. His hands are still occupied with too many coffee cups.

"The giggling? Yes." Cas answers him.

The Coffee Guy is visibly relieved for a moment. "Oh great," he says, in an English accent, "I thought I was imagining things. I think something odd is happening here."

"You think?" Dean pointedly nods at the busker's guitar box. Cas checks on the angel fountain again.

"Do you know anything about it?" Cas asks without looking back, but doesn't hear any answer.

"Cas!" Dean yells with a hitched voice, dragging him backward with large steps.

The Coffee Guy has disappeared from the thin air. Where he was standing, on the ground, there are the four missing cherub statues, frozen in a fumbling, crawling shape, just like some frozen frame of playful little babies having fun in their own way, looking innocent and harmless.

They back away quickly, keeping their eyes on the statues.

"Guess we find the missing cherubs, at least." Dean says, breathing fast.

"Not funny, Dean." Cas says.

"Not laughing." Dean replies, pointing his gun at the stones. "Long shot, but, any chance you know what's happening here? Anything to do with angels?"

"They are not really angels, they are just statues." Cas stares at the cherubs. They remain still in his gaze. "They're not real. How can they possibly be alive?"

"I'm not sure 'alive' is the right term here." Dean glances back to check how much farther they can back away before hitting anything. "I have a theory but I don't want to test it."

"Dean?" Cas glances quickly at Dean then looks back at the stones. The cherubs have moved in that split of a second when neither of them are not looking. They moved closer to them, small chubby arms reaching out like babies asking for a cradle, mouths opening, tiny fangs showing at the edge of the lips.

Dean gasps again when he looks back, dragging both of them hurried away farther from the statues. "Don't look away!" He snaps. "Okay call me crazy but here's my theory: They can only move when we are not looking. So as long as we keep our eyes on them, we are safe."

"What do you think happened to the people disappeared? Are they dead?" Cas asks, not blinking at all as he stares.

"I don't know, let's hope not. We'll figure that out after we get out of here first. You think you can fly us out of here?" Dean feels his eyes sore and dry quickly with too long time of not blinking.

"I still have my wings, if that's your question." Cas answers stoically. "But I'd rather not use them if possible."

"Why not?"

"Naomi and the angels might still be looking for me, in case you forget, they are not happy when I got away." Cas manages a well-maintained voice, too flat. "Using any angelic power or my wings might make it very easy for them to locate me and continue the process they intended to apply on me last time."

"Alright, no fly, no mojo, then. But we gotta find a way out quick. 'Cause I can't keep on not blinking for any longer." Dean moans.

"I have my eyes on it. You can blink." Cas tells him.

Dean relaxes a little, blinking a few times to soothe the dryness in his eyes.

"Don't blink! Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink!! Blink and you're dead!" A skinny man yells at them from across the plaza, pointing a flashing device at them, dashing in their direction, followed by a ginger-haired girl.

### Act 1

Dean automatically follows the order, looking back at the cherubs. "I'm not blinking." He says, answering the skinny guy.

The cherub statues haven't moved an inch since they start staring at them.

The man rushes to their side, pointing the buzzing device in his hand directly at the statues. The device gives off an electronic beeping sound. Dean keeps trying to steal a glimpse at what he's doing, but doesn't dare to move his gaze away. He watches the man from the peripheral of his eyes.

There is a pitch and turn in the buzzing sound as the man moves his hand around, then an explosion sound as a final touch. The cherub statues fly backward a few feet, and shattered to pieces.

Dean assumes that should mean it is safe to stop staring now. He turns his head, pointing at whatever-it-is in the man's hand, and he says, "I want one of these."

The man waves it around like a kid showing off a new toy that only he has, and he says, "My sonic screwdriver? Sorry, limited edition, one and only in the universe."

"What did you do to them?" Cas asks from Dean's side.

"Absorbed the temporal energy they just ate, that should starve them weak for a few minutes before their next feed. They might come back any time though." The man tilts the sparkling pen-looking thing -- sonic screwdriver, he said? -- and flashes it a few times, frowning at it as if he's reading something from a tiny screen on its body. "Oh bad, that's bad -- I think they just absorbed energy from at least two people, maybe three."

"Who are you?" Dean snaps.

The man looks up from the screwdriver, meeting his eyes, waving a hand roughly in their direction, uttering rapidly, "Hello, I'm the Doctor, I'm a Time Lord. This is Amy, she's Scottish. We are time travelers. Any questions? No? Good. Now, where is Rory?"

Dean looks him up and down. The skinny man is about his height, his hair as ruffled as Cas's in his early days, wearing a shirt and a brown tweed jacket. Dean's gaze land on his collar, "I gotta ask, bow tie, really?"

The Doctor widens his eyes a little, straightening his bow tie self-consciously, "Bow tie is cool."

Dean and the girl -- Amy -- chuck at the same time.

That's when Cas says, "Yes, I have questions. I thought Time Lords were extinct after the Time War, the whole Gallifrey was wiped from existence."

Dean stares at him, "What?"

The Doctor frowns, "How--?" A pause, then narrows his eyes, "You are not human."

Cas answers flatly, holding the gaze, "Neither are you."

Dean raises his voice slightly, "You know them?"

Cas breaks the gaze to turn his head to Dean, "They are aliens. Gallifreians, specifically. But they call themselves Time Lords -- it sounds better. They have two hearts and regeneration abilities, basically twelve lives for each one of them." He looks back at the Doctor, "Did I miss anything?"

The Doctor considers for a beat, "Sounds about right."

Dean's still staring at Cas, "Aliens. You know aliens exist and you never thought to tell me?"

Cas stares back, "You never asked."

Dean rolls his eyes, "Any other aliens? Lizard-people are real?"

Cas answers, "A lot. They're actually called Silurian, local on Earth, and Earth is not the only planet with life forms..."

Amy clears her throat, "Guys, focus! Not the time!"

Dean turns to her and says quickly, "Sorry."

Cas says the same. "Sorry."

The girl with red hair has an attractive face and a very strong commanding charisma that people might just tend to listen to her without knowing why, Dean notices. Himself included.

Amy asks, "Where is Rory?"

Dean waves his hands to gesture the height and hair, "The Coffee Guy? Yay high, nerdy hair, shirt and jacket?"

Amy thins her lips, "That's him. He was just buying us coffees --"

"-- And my sonic screwdriver caught some wild and strange temporal energy surge, so we followed the signal here --" the Doctor smoothly carries on with Amy's sentence, head tilted and carefully search their faces.

"-- Have you seen him? Where is he now?" Amy asks worriedly.

Cas answers with a compassionate voice, the one they usually use on victims' family members, "I'm sorry, but the statues touched him --"

"-- and he just vanished." Dean finishes his sentence.

"Oh God," Amy covers her face, turning to the Doctor, her voice desperate, "where did they send him?"

The Doctor looks restless, his eyes swimming around the fountain and the empty terrace, not meeting Amy's eyes. "I don't know," he says, in a painful, regretful voice. "I'm sorry, Amy, but I don't know."

Dean studies them, "Wait, so, you know what happened to him?"

Cas says beside him, "The statues, you know what they are, don't you? You told us not to blink. What are they?"

The Doctor nods briefly, "They are not statues. They're Weeping Angels, the deadliest, most powerful, most malevolent life form evolution has ever created. The Lonely Assassins, they used to be called. No one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the universe, or very nearly. They have the most perfect defence mechanism that nature has ever evolved. They're quantum locked. They don't exist when they're being observed. The moment they're seen by any other living creature, they literally turn to stone, and you can't kill a stone. 'Course, a stone can't kill you either, but then you turn your head away. Then you blink. That's when they hit, they kill you nice and slow, no mess, no fuss -- they send you back into the past and let you live to death, the rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye. You die in the past and in the present, they consume the energy of all the days you might have had. All your stolen moments. They're creatures of the abstract, they live off *potential* energy."

Dean needs a moment to process the information, he starts with "So --", but that's as far as he gets.

"Guys! The Angel!" Amy points over his head.

Dean and Cas turn sharply. Behind them, the Angel of Water statue has moved when none of them lay their eyes on it. The probable mother statue of the four cherub statues has turned toward them, wings spreading high and wide in an attacking pose, face fierce with fangs. Her hands are claws with long nails now, frozen in the posture of reaching out to grab them.

Cas's face grimaces at the sight of it.

Dean tries not to panic, "Is it just me or does she look super pissed?"

The Doctor answers, "Maybe I shouldn't blow up her children in her face."

"What do we do, Doctor?" Amy asks in a pitched voice.

"Can't you use your sonic thing on her again?" Dean suggests to his back, not dare to move his eyes away.

The electronic buzz sounds up near their heads. Dean can see a shade of bright green flashing at the corner of his eyes.

But nothing happens to the statue.

"Ah, she's too strong for the same trick." The Doctor says frustratedly. "The usual then, run! Run!!"

"Where?!" Dean yells.

"The Tardis!" The Doctor yells back from a small distance away. It sounds like he and Amy already started the running without Dean and Cas.

"WHAT?!" Dean shouts.

"THE TARDIS!!" The Doctor is farther away, heading out of Central Park to the southeast direction.

Backing away with your eyes focused on a creepy statue without blinking is impossible, let alone running. Dean finds out.

He holds out an arm to keep balance, just in case there is anything on the ground behind him that might trip him over. Cas takes his hand, keeping him guided, and maybe to keep himself balanced as well.

The two of them take their steps back cautiously together, step by step.

"Now would be a really good time if you can just fly us out or use those other eyes you said you have." Dean says gloomily.

"Or you can go, I'll keep staring at her." Cas offers.

"No! Absolutely no," Dean snaps immediately without thinking, "no way I'd just leave you here. Not again. We'll get out together."

Cas falls quiet for a short moment.

They can't hear any other footsteps behind or around them. Not human's, not creepy stone angel's.

"You think those two might just run off?" Dean can't help wondering aloud. "We might just be two big idiots and the perfect baits to keep the statue thing still, so they can buy some time to get away."

"You don't trust them?" Cas asks.

"What, you do?" Dean retorts, "He's an alien with two hearts and a funny bow tie!"

"And I'm a celestial being with wings and no body." Cas says flatly.

Dean makes a choked sound, "Which side are you?"

Cas lets out a stifled chuckle, "Yours, of course."

Dean tilts his head toward Cas so much that he almost glances at his face automatically but manages to stop himself not to lose eye contact with the Angel statue.

He's not convinced, "We don't even know what that 'Tardis' thing is."

Just as he speaks, a loud metallic thrumming sound echoes from the sky. The air around them ripples like animation, turning from open outdoor space to a dimly lit indoor space with green and blue lightings.

A cheerful voice sounds up behind them, "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard the Tardis."

<br>

### Act 2

Cas lets go of Dean's hand.

They look around.

The Doctor busies himself around a central structure that Dean's pretty sure is where all the engines and control units are -- if any of the sci-fi movies has any truth in them. A huge, bright pumping pillar with glass spheres vibrate up and down, making loud whirring sound -- that's the sound they heard when the whole thing just materialized itself around them.

Dean watches the structure moving, walking slowly toward the console table and the guy running around it. "Do all your toys have to make funny noises?"

Amy can't hold back a small laughing sound from the other side of the table.

The Doctor rolls his eyes at Dean, offended, "This is Tardis! Of course she has to make this beautiful sound! What do you know about 'Time and Relative Dimension in Space'?"

Dean stutters, "Ugh, come again?"

The Doctor smirks, "Like I thought. If you don't know anything about her, don't make rude comments! She might be upset."

"She might be upset if you keep the brake on when landing. That's where the noise comes from." Cas follows Dean up the steps around the hexagon-shaped console table, pointing at a handle on its face. "Type Forty model's common problem."

The Doctor narrows his eyes at Cas a second time of the day. He unleashes the handle to the opposite direction, the noise quiets just like Cas said. "What are you?" The Doctor asks cautiously, "I don't think I've ever met your kind before."

"I'm an Angel of the Lord." Cas answers potently.

Dean adds, "He's with me." He squares his shoulders, feeling oddly proud.

The Doctor eyes both of them carefully, as if only now does he properly register them. "Relative to the Weeping Angels?" He asks, probing.

"I don't think so." Cas answers frankly, "I've only known them the first time today."

"But you know a lot of things, you know about the Time Lords and Tardis," the Doctor purses his lips. "I don't like it."

Cas lowers his head a little, "That was unexpected knowledge to me as well, back when I was the God. Long story."

Amy whispers to Dean, "Don't mind him. He's just jealous, he doesn't like *not* being the smartest man in the room."

Dean grins, putting a hand on Cas's shoulder. "Alright, you two, enough peacock time. What are we all doing in here? Thanks for not leaving us behind, by the way, I wasn't sure about that."

The Doctor rolls his eyes again, "Of course I wouldn't do that, what do you take me for?"

Dean shrugs.

Amy answers on the Doctor's behalf, "You said the angels sent Rory back, and we think the cherubs don't have enough power to send him too far, so we might still have a chance to find him and save him -- good thing that Tardis is a time machine. So we only need to find out exactly when and where, Doctor thinks he can trace back the temporal signal, but it takes some time to calculate."

She gestures to the console panel where the sonic screwdriver is plugged in, a display screen on top of it showing some running patterns, presumably working like a computer.

Dean looks at the screen for a few moments, realizing he can't read a thing -- they're not even in English, the patterns with circles and lines are as beautiful as stars and planets but give no clue. He tilts his head and whispers to Cas, "It's like watching Sammy do the research, all the nerdy science stuff."

Cas hums softly, a fond smile showing at the mention.

Dean claps his hands, "Alright, what do we do while waiting then? You gonna give us a tour around the ship or what? Tell me you have booze here." He moves away from the console, curiously sneaking a peek at the spiral staircase on the other side of the room leading upward.

The Doctor snorts, "That is so American."

Dean rolls his eyes, "What, you drink tea instead?"

Amy cuts in, "You think it's a ship?"

Dean looks around the spherical space they're in -- which has a ton of round decorations on the curved walls and the ceiling as if they're inside a huge sphere at least three floors tall, he wonders if anyone on the Bethesda Terrace would have noticed this probably enormous alien-looking spaceship from outside, but he decides if their alien techniques are as advanced as the rest of it look like, they're probably invisible.

Dean nods at their surrounding to make a point and looks back at Amy, "A spaceship, yeah? What else can it be?"

Amy winks with a mysterious smile, "It's a time machine. It can go to all the time and all the place in the universe."

"A time-travel spaceship. A timceship!" Dean announces the newly-invented nickname proudly.

The Tardis makes a low gnarling sound right then, among the constant wheezing.

"She doesn't like it, don't ever say that again!" The Doctor says without looking away from the view-screen.

"That can't be true. Wait, can she really hear me?" Dean turns to Cas in confusion. But even Cas has a mischief curve on the tip of his lips.

Dean glares at Cas unbelievably, "Not you too."

The curve widens slightly on Cas's lips, and he says, "Well, I speak all languages in the universe, including Tardis'."

Dean finds it impossible to tell if he's serious or a joke.

Amy pets the console desk like it's a delicate living thing, fingers stroking along the blinking buttons and sliders and connecting cables, says fondly, "She's a good girl, and she's *Tardis*. Don't think there is any word in the universe cooler than that."

Dean pretends a defeated sigh, turning back to Amy, "You remind me of someone. She's like a sister to me. Also red hair. I think you'd like her if you stick around longer. Now, drink?"

Amy smiles small, giving him an appreciated nod, stepping toward one of the roundels on the wall. She presses on some of them, as if looking for a correct password combination to open something. "Sorry, River, I think there're some stash somewhere --"

The Doctor looks up at her, confused, "What do you mean? There's nothing there --"

That's when a hidden cabinet opens, showing a secret stash of delicate bottles of liqueurs.

The Doctor is speechless for a second, "When did -- It's *my* Tardis! You can't just make random adjustment like that -- ahh, River!!"

Dean admires the collection, grinning, "Now we are talking." All the top-shelf fine collections, nothing he'd spot in places they'd usually go -- in fact, now that he thinks about that, given that they're on some alien's spaceship, these might not even be from Earth, and considering the time travel, they are most certainly not from current time, which means the drinks could have ages and ages to brew properly.

He pours himself a glass, appreciating the flavor, "Whoever this River dude is, he certainly has taste."

"*She* --" Amy emphasizes, "is my daughter."

Dean is taken aback a little, mentally measuring Amy's age, trying to do the math. "Is she even to the age?"

"And my wife." The Doctor adds weight to the bomb drop.

Dean stares at him, then looks back and forth between the Doctor and Amy. "Wait, that means you two are --"

"Mother-in-law, I know." Amy's face drops unhappily for some reason, "Time travel thing, it's a long story. Two thousand years long, actually, not sure I want to talk about it, especially when Rory is not here."

The Doctor's face glooms at the same moment, he start randomly flipping a few switches up and down.

"Time travel is never easy, isn't it?" Cas suddenly comments. He's been watching them quietly for some time. "Always so much regrets in the past you'd want to change, but you just couldn't save everyone, and you can't change the fix points even if you can travel back in time."

The Doctor gives him a deep look. "Indeed." He says with a low voice. The word is simple but his tone is fractured.

Their eyes meet, both as aged as the length of the universe itself. There is a moment of understanding.

Dean watches them, suddenly realizes with more clarity than ever -- that Cas is old, really old, as old as the Earth and Sun and the beginning of all the Time and Universe. And here he is, standing in the room, wearing a trench coat, walking and talking. That Doctor has probably seen just as much time and universe to have eyes as sad and deep. He swallows. He's just a human.

Dean takes a gulp at the drink. The liqueur smooths down his throat, but it's still dry.

"You lost someone, didn't you?" He asks. The question slips out of his tongue without permission.

The Doctor shoots him a pained look. "I'm hoping not anymore." he says simply, his eyes lingering on Amy's back for a moment too long.

The four of them fall quiet for a brief moment, only hearing the tiny tinkling sound from the Tardis. And then it beeps loudly, with a red flashing sign shining on the screen. The ceiling is rounded by a circle of red light shortly after.

They jump to their feet toward the console.

"That doesn't look good." Dean comments. Whatever it is, red flashing thing is never a good thing.

The Doctor looks closely, Cas stands next to him, reading the same screen.

"What does it say?" Amy urges, "Did it find Rory?"

"April the third, 1938, old-town New York." Cas reads the message, frowning.

Dean claps his hands, "Good, we have the time and location, let's go. What are we waiting for?"

The Doctor unplugs the sonic screwdriver from the control panel, beaming its head toward the screen. The familiar metallic whirring sound echoes again, the floor bumping like an airplane in heavy turbulence. Then the red warning alarm screams louder, and the floor they're standing on start shaking violently in all directions. The lighting inside the whole space blink on and off as the floor wobbles, turning to a dark crimson red color. The color of blood and danger.

Amy and Dean have to grab the closest handrail to steady themselves, the Doctor and Cas lean on the console desk.

The Doctor yells over the loud emergency alarm. "She doesn't let us land! It's like a storm blizzard out there. Hang on!"

Cas puts both his hands on the metal handle he pointed out earlier -- the brake, apparently. The quaking eases for a few seconds, but almost immediately turning into a sideward spinning. All of them fall to the floor, swinging toward one side of the wall then the other; the handle is let loose, shifting up and down rapidly on its own.

The Doctor stretches his arm to reach for a hammer from underneath the console, striking on the surface. "This usually works!" he shouts at the frantic central control unit, "Come on, you sexy thing! You can do it!"

"You are making it worse!" Cas yells back.

The console makes an extremely loud explosion sound, followed by a strong burning smell and dark smoke bursting from the fried panel, the brake handle flies to the ceiling and lands on the floor in two pieces.

The whirring sound slows down, but the spinning wall gets worse. They can do nothing but to grasp whatever they hold on to for their dear lives.

Dean clutches the handrail with whitened knuckles, thinking how bad this idea is to board an alien ship. He doesn't even like to take airplanes, why does he ever enter a time-travel spaceship that doesn't even have a seatbelt.

Amy had fell not far from him, clinging to the same handrail as he does. In the first bout of spinning and crashing, Amy slipped right near his side. So Dean has enough of distraction trying to give the lady a soft landing to not completely freak out.

And then the floor comes to rest. So are the vibrating spherical things in the center of the control pillar, which -- if a spaceship works the same way as a car -- probably means the engine has died when the brake blew off. The room is filled with smoke.

"Out! Out!!" The Doctor dashes to the door, pulling it wide, urging all of them out. In his hand, there is a fire extinguisher.

Dean and Amy rush out of the door, Cas follows closely after them. The Doctor yells at the control: "Extractor fans on!!" The loud noise of fans rumbles to life on his command.

"What the hell was that?" Dean demands, stumbling out, coughing violently because of the smoke, catching himself on the knees. Cas hurries toward him, whispering to ask if he's hurt, and Dean waves him off because he's fine.

"1938, we just bounced off it." The Doctor pokes his head out of a blue phone box, white foams and dark smoke flying in and out of the opened door.

Dean straightens up when he finally catches his breath.

They are in the middle of a graveyard, countless tombs and stones lying around them. Statues of angels and decorative figures stand at the border of the yard, in the stance of mourning and protecting. New York modern skyscrapers can be seen over the horizon.

"Where are we?" Amy asks.

"Still in New York," the Doctor raises a finger in the air, feeling the wind, then puts the finger in his tongue, tasting the air. "Not-1938."

<br>

"You have a time machine, and it goes anywhere but 1938? How does that work?" Dean asks sharply.

"I don't know! Something is wrong with that time, I think probably too many Weeping Angels there, the time flux is all scrambled." The Doctor finishes with the fire extinguisher, changing to use his sonic screwdriver, beaming at the blue box the same way he pointed at the cherub statues earlier.

"And what's the deal with that blue box?" Dean peeks through the door, finding the inside is just the same spacious control room he was in moments ago. He walks around it, staring at the letters "Police Box" on top of the door. The inside is the time-traveling spaceship he fancied, but the outside just looks like a very English-looking police phone box from 50s, can barely fit two grown men. Dean can't say he's not disappointed. "It's smaller on the outside."

The Doctor rolls his eyes. "That's a first, people usually say 'bigger on the inside'."

"Same thing." Dean mumbles.

"It's a disguise. I like it, I keep it, problem?" the Doctor cocks his head in challenge.

"Or it might be a malfunction in the Camouflage Unit and Cloaking Device, probably the chameleon circuit has broken down?" Cas suggests kindly.

Dean wiggles his brows, "How about that?"

The Doctor stares them down. "Shut up." he says, turning back to the Tardis.

He fondles the charred paint on its exterior, his touch gentle and loving. He presses his forehead on the doorframe, Dean can hear him murmur quietly: "I'm so sorry, Dear. Take your time, rest up. We'll find another way."

Dean raises one eyebrow, amused.

Cas whispers at Dean's ear: "I think Tardis is like his Impala."

Dean turns to him sharply, "I'm not like that --"

Cas gives him a pointed look.

Dean stutters, his cheeks heated. "Shut up."

He turns to look what the other two are doing now, thinking what to do.

"What you said about the time flux," Dean asks, "What's that? How do we fix it?"

Cas explains to him, "Time is fluid. I told you that before, that's why we can bend it on occasions."

"I didn't realize that means literally actual *fluid*." Dean feels like the slowest kid in the school, "Thought it's more of a metaphor, like, 'as time passes by like river flowing' kind of thing."

"No, no, nothing like a river." The Doctor chimes in, "Humans can only understand things in such strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff."

Dean raises his eyebrows, "That is just so English." He cackles.

The Doctor disappears inside the blue box, and reappears with a clumsy, odd-looking, circuit-wrapped scavenger device that looks like it's built from a bunch of sixties household items and kitchen utensils. A little bigger than his palms.

They watch him pull out two antennas and wave the device around, reading some display on it only he can understand.

"Doctor, what's that?" Amy asks.

"My timey-wimey detector," he concentrates on the reading, turning from one direction to another. "The Tardis navigation system is busted, I need something to tell me when and where we are. It goes 'ding' when it detects stuff."

"I made a better hand-made EMF than that when I was ten." Dean tells Cas in a low murmur.

"I made it three hundred years ago when I got trapped in 1969," the Doctor says loudly. Dean's not sure he heard his last comment. "by Weeping Angels too, that time. Not very fun."

"Sound like you got trapped by Angels a lot, Doctor." Amy remarks.

"They are nasty creatures." the Doctor wrinkles his nose like he smells something disgusting, "I hate things attacking you from your back when you are not looking." He says one word at a time, slowly, "I, hate, Angels."

Cas shifts uncomfortably by Dean's side.

Dean glances at him, talking in a low voice, "He doesn't mean you."

"I know." Cas answers. But still, his gaze drops to his feet.

The device in the Doctor's hand makes a "ding" sound.

"So, looks like we are still in 2012, back where we started." he tells them.

"A long way from 1938," Amy paces up and down the field in the graveyard, worry radiating into the air. "There must be a way to go there, we can't just leave Rory there. Doctor? Come on, come up with some brilliant ideas, like you usually do."

The Doctor runs a hand through his hair, mumbling, "I have two, but one of them requires a Vortex Manipulator, which I don't have, because I left it to River after the Pandorica, which leaves only one. But I really, really don't like it."

The three of them wait for him to spill out, but the Doctor hesitates.

Amy snaps, "What is it?"

The Doctor looks at her sheepishly, "We can let the Angels touch us and send us back."

"Would that work?" Amy asks, unafraid.

"I don't know. They might send us to different times, I might never find you or Rory again. That's what I'm afraid of." The Doctor says in a pained voice.

"But that's our only chance of finding Rory, right?" Amy glances around, already looking for the nearest Weeping Angel statue she can use.

"Amy --" The Doctor pleas quietly.

Cas chimes in suddenly, "There is another way."

"Cas, no --" Dean knows what's in his mind immediately, holding out a hand trying to stop Cas.

Cas steps toward Amy, "I can fly us there." Dean closes his eyes.

The Doctor studies him, "Then why don't you say so earlier?"

Dean answers for him, "Because it might kill him."

"It doesn't matter." Cas keeps his eyes on Amy, ignoring Dean's gaze on his back.

"'Course it does!" Dean snaps, "Cas, damnit! You said Naomi could find you and do whatever horrible things she has in mind on you!"

"Or maybe not. If we're quick enough, go there and back in a blink, she might never notice." Cas retorts, holding out a hand toward Amy. "I can help."

Amy glances between Cas and Dean, then smiles at Cas, "You really are an angel, aren't you?"

Cas smiles back, "I try to be."

Dean sighs loudly, standing closer to Cas. "I'll go too. One more person, should find him quicker."

The Doctor steps into the small circle they formed around Cas as well, following what the other two are doing, putting his palm on the hand Cas holds out.

He winks at the group, "Well then -- Geronimo!"

<br>

### draft notes

unused witty comments:

about Tardis: Cas: "it says 'Pull to open', why do you push?"

Doctor uses hammer to "fix" Tardis, Cas: "No wonder she's pissed at you" "You could hear her?" "I speak all languages in the universe"

on the Tardis console: buttons, handles, sliders, keyboards, displays, trumpet, glass floor, power cables, electrical lines; all sorts of toys. not really keyboards, old-style typewriter. Dean can't help touching them, Doctor: "Don't touch anything" Dean looks disappointed, taking his hand back. But Cas sees he still tries to press on the button closest to him, it blinks blue a few times, but does nothing else. Dean looks like a happy kid with a new toy.

about flying Tardis: River: "Use the stabilizer" Doctor: "There is no stabilizer." River: "It's the blue thing, what do you think it does?" Doctor: "I don't know, it's just blue." he tries, it stabilize: "Now it's just boring. It's blue boring-er."

It's not the first time Dean get flied around in a wing-trip, but this is certainly the top five most unpleasant journey. He doesn't remember the other times being so rocky and nauseous. Even worse than the crash landing in the Tardis the very same afternoon earlier.

The color and lights are muffled into a big kaleidoscope around him, spinning in speed higher than his eyes and brain can possibly process. He really should have closed his eyes.

When his feet touch the ground in the rattled sound of wings fluttering, Dean stumbles to the ground on all fours, vomiting his breakfast burger and fries out.

"Cas, that's hell of a fly." He wipes his mouth, looking around.

The night is dark, the road has wet puddles from a recent rain. The oil lamps by the road dimly light the street, showing vintage cars parked in front of a glamorous mansion, statues standing across the street to it. The air smells damp cigar smoke and classy perfume, covering a lingering smell of horse. The sense of thirties is permeating in the air.

The Doctor and Amy are scrambling up from the ground just like him, recovering from an inelegant landing. The Doctor points his sonic screwdriver in all directions, making that small buzzing sound again, looks like trying to get a reading on the thin air.

"Where is Cas?" Dean sweeps around their landing point, then notices a small movement on the side of a parked car. He catches a glimpse of tan color and rushes there.

Cas slumps against the side of the car, eyes closed, panting heavily. His face is pale, his chest heaving and falling. Scratches of cuttings and bleeding marks all over his bare skin and clothes, more bloody wounds under the torn shirt and pants, misty light faintly glimmering in a few of deep cuts. A smear of blood at the corner of his mouth.

Dean is instantly reminded of the last time Cas is weakened severely by a flight, kicking himself mentally for forgetting how much it always seem to exhaust him.

He shakes Cas on the shoulder gently, trying not to let the worry leaking everywhere in his voice, "Hey man, how you holding up?"

Cas opens his eyes with a moan, eyes dazed for a moment before focusing on Dean's face. "Been better." he says, wiping his mouth, only to smudge the blood stain worse.

"Is it Naomi?" Dean asks, using his own cuff to help Cas clean up.

Cas shakes his head slightly, "It's the time flux itself. It's so... chaotic." He looks for a word to describe, then lands on -- "Scrambled. Too many Weeping Angels, we are not safe." Just like the Doctor has guessed before.

Amy comes over too, "How's he doing?"

The Doctor says behind them, before Dean can answer, "Imagine when Tardis crashed, it's like trying to land a plane in a blizzard, and now? He's like a bird going through that same storm, no helmet, no seatbelt! And carry three passengers!" His voice is impressed. "Welcome to 1938."

"And he did it." Amy murmurs quietly, kneeling down next to Cas, looking at his face closely. "You did it, you brought us all here. Thank you!" She says it whole-heartedly, then turns to Dean, "He'll be okay, right?"

"He's tough," Dean says, waving a hand at her, "Why don't you and Doc go ahead looking for your man, I'll help him catch a breath first. He'd need enough strength for the trip home."

Amy nods appreciatedly, moving to check with the Doctor.

Cas's eyes follow their movement.

"Can you heal?" Dean asks with concern.

Cas frowns at himself with concentration, the way he would focus whenever he puts a finger on Dean's forehead and heals him, Dean watches his open wounds closely. They are not healed.

Cas shakes his head frustratedly. "I'm interfered," he says glumly, "Whatever is happening in the city, it's affecting my power, too. I can try harder but it might exhaust me more than healing me."

Only the slow, natural healing then. Like a human. Dean watches him, worried.

Cas holds an arm on the wet ground, making an effort trying to stand up. Dean reaches for his other arm, helping him on his feet.

Cas wobbles a little, but he manages to stand straight.

Dean smoothens out his trench coat and fixes his tie. The tears and cuttings don't look half as bad this way.

"It's too dangerous out here," Cas's voice is croaked, tone warning, "They can be anywhere, any statues." He nods at across street, Dean follows his sight, noticing the two statues standing in the light lit from the mansion, the statues of a mother and a son. The remnants of the rain dripping on their faces, it's almost like their eyes are gleaming, staring intensely at the house.

"He's right, too much temporal disturbance, I can't get a good reading," the Doctor says, swinging the sonic screwdriver a few times like trying vainly to fix an used-up ink pen. "If the Angels are in this city, we're sitting ducks out here. Let's go inside first."

"You good to walk, man?" Dean asks under his breath, stilling holding Cas up like supporting an old man to cross streets.

Cas answers him, "I'm not fragile, Dean."

Dean doesn't move his hands away until they reach the building.

<br>

The giant, beautiful, classic-looking architecture in front of them is the biggest, most likely the richest house they can see around the place, and best of all, the brightest, with the most light -- where they can for sure see the Weeping Angels coming if they dare try.

Amy knocks at the door.

It takes long minutes for the guards to open at least half a dozen locks behind the door by the sound of them, and it's pushed open with only enough of a slit to show the guards' eyes. "Mr. Grayle does not expect more guests tonight."

"Tell him we are with the guests he already had." The Doctor answers.

The guards mutter quietly between themselves, probably waiting for a confirmation from higher authority.

They wait impatiently for a few minutes, Dean can't help himself. "Oh come on, it's taking too long."

He moves to the door, pulling out his badge, "FBI inspection, open the door."

The guards back away from behind the door hesitantly, open it wilder for them to enter, and relock each one of them quickly.

"Mr. Grayle is on the second floor with the Detective." the guards inform them.

They don't really need the guide to know where to find the owner of the place. The study on the second floor is dazzling bright, as if the man has spent half his fortune on collecting all the brightest light source in the world to put together, keeping the place as bright as day time. Massive chandeliers hang on the ceiling, wall sconces lining together with the oil paintings, spotlights shining with a great variety of ancient chinaware, and lamps and bulbs practically taking over every corner of the room.

They follow the ancient spiral stairs to the second floor and march into the study. A fleshy, boastful-looking man in fancy suit stands in front of the desk, a woman near a corner alcove by the wall.

Dean walks into the room, flashing his FBI badge at the people in the room, announcing, "I'm Agent Plant. This is my partner, Agent Page."

He turns his head slightly at Cas, giving him a meaningful glance. Cas pulls out his badge like Dean did with a straight face -- the badge is displayed upside down.

Dean lets out a quiet sigh, correcting it for him. Cas murmurs, "Is it really necessary, Dean?"

And Dean looks down at his own badge, putting it away with another sigh. "Not really", he says, "'cause I read from a book they already knew it's fake."

The woman looks at them with a small amused mockery, "That certainly looks fake to me."

Her eyes shift quickly toward the Doctor and Amy behind them, the grin turning into a wild smile, "Hello, Sweetie." her eyes sparkle with joy of the reunion, "Took you long enough."

The Doctor tilts his head slightly, meeting with a similar smile, "Sorry, didn't know you're here too, hon -- traffic was hell."

"How did you get here then?" The woman raises her left arm, showing a dark colored device on her wrist. While her right wrist -- Dean only notices now, after getting used to the lighting in the room -- is grasped tight by a Weeping Angel statue locked to the alcove wall. The statue looks more feral than the Angel of Water or any of the cherubs, it doesn't hide its face with palms, so all the fangs and wild fierce look is written clearly in each line and crack on its face. The stone on the statue is cracked and erodent, the eye sockets sunken deep on the face. It looks angry -- furious, perhaps -- which might have something to do with the long heavy chains that tether it to the plinth and the wall.

"No way Tardis can land in time turbulence like this, not even I can do that. And I took the Vortex Manipulator. So how did you?" the woman asks curiously, not giving the Angel holding her a second look, as if she's not noticing the dangerous situation she's in.

"Got help from some new friends." the Doctor taps Dean and Cas on the shoulders lightly. Dean is a little surprised at the word choice he used, but he's not complaining.

"I see." the woman regards them, not hiding at all the way her eyes checking both of them up and down. Not in an uncomfortable way. More curious than anything.

Dean meets her eyes while hers linger on his face. Dean notices at the same time how attractive and sexy she looks, and for some reason, familiar. He tries to scratch the memory where he might know her from -- the tight leather jacket, the bright red lips, all cleavage and curves -- he gasps with realization, nudges Cas and whispers, "She's the one from the book."

"What book?" The woman watches him closely.

"Enough babbling," the rich man -- must be the so called Mr. Grayle -- steps into the center of the room, demanding their attention, "What's going on? Who are you? Detective Malone, I demand answers!"

"Shush, grown-ups are talking." The woman shoots him a stern look with enough might, as if *she* is the owner of the place. The man hangs his mouth open unbelievably with no words coming out.

"*You* are Melody Malone?" Cas catches up too, realizing what Dean's telling him.

"And how did *you* know River is Melody?" Amy raises her question.

Cas answers River, "I found your book in our motel, with Dean and my name in it."

He pulls the book out of his pocket and passes it over to Amy. The cover looks exactly like River.

"A book I haven't written yet. I see, common problem with time travel." River glances at it, making a face, "I don't like the cover."

The Doctor stares at Cas, "And you didn't think to mention it earlier?"

Dean defends, "We didn't even know what that is."

"All the more reasons." River says calmly.

Amy opens the pages. "It has my name too," she tells them, "and Rory, and Doctor."

"I was just wondering how did you know where to find me this time. I was *just* thinking about sending you a message." River says with a mild smile. "A kiss in time flux."

The Doctor answers, "Total coincident this time, sorry, River. We were actually tracking Rory."

Grayle runs up all his patience, raising his voice, "Okay I have enough of this nonsense. Guards! Get them out of here!"

"I wouldn't suggest that." The Doctor warns with a low voice.

The two hefty guards they met at the gate burst into the room, each having a gun in their hands, pointing menacingly at them.

Dean draws out his own gun, pointing at the taller one among the two. Cas steps closer to him, raising a palm in a defending gesture. The Doctor steps in front of River and Amy, pointing at the guards with his sonic screwdriver like a weapon.

"Very West Side Story." Dean comments, "What now? You're outnumbered."

"Not if I let the Angels in." Grayle threatens with a vicious smile.

"Risk sending yourself back in time? You wouldn't dare." The Doctor reads his face.

"How would you know?" Grayle challenges.

"There are awful lot of locks on the door downstairs. And the blinding light here." The Doctor points out, meeting the man's mousey eyes, his tone icy, "You're scared. Which is good. Scare is good, means you know they're dangerous. Because they *are*, beyond your puny little head's understanding. They are dangerous, they are patient, and they are fast, faster than any of us. No one stand a chance when they attack."

Grayle opens his palms, gesturing arrogantly at the luxurious ancient-looking decorations and collections displayed around them, then at the chained statue at the alcove that still grips River's wrist, "Except I'm a collector. And you know what, they make the perfect collection."

"A collector and the New York crime boss, how does that work?" River provokes.

"Isn't that the same thing?" Grayle's eyes gleam, "Now, Detective, where are we? Oh right, my friends," he nods at the group, leaving his glance especially longer on the Doctor, "why don't you do as I say, or you watch *her* suffer."

He flips the light switch on the wall before they can say anything. River gasps in the sudden darkness. All the lights are turned back on a second later.

The chained angel statue has moved in that blink of darkness. It dragged River closer to its body, the grip on her wrist is so tight and powerful that her whole arm is twisted outward in an odd angle. The Angel's right arm raises high with all the long claw nails out -- it's on the rim of a striking pose and there is no way to run. River grits her teeth, cursing loudly, "Damn you!"

"I hope you take it seriously now," Grayle smiles meaningfully at the rest of them, "One more flip, the Angel can snap her neck."

"What do you want?" The Doctor has burning fire in his eyes, his voice colder than glacier.

"Those two, take them to the babies, like the other one." The man talks to the guards, gesturing to Dean and Amy.

Dean shifts his gun toward him, "Or I can just blast a hole on your chest." He spits.

"I assure you," Grayle says in his greasy voice, "I can flip the switch before you pull the trigger."

"Please, don't." The Doctor lowers his voice, Dean realizes he's talking to him. "And please take care of Amy, we'll come to you as soon as we can."

"Take me with them, then." The words surprise many of them, and it is Cas, stepping toward Grayle. "I'm no use to you here, let me go with them."

Grayle sizes him up with interest, glancing between him and Dean.

"Cas --" Dean has lowered his weapon, letting himself grabbed by the arms by the guard he pointed gun to earlier. The other man takes Amy, shoving her out.

Dean manages to turn his head and meet Cas's eyes even as he is on his way getting pushed out of the door. "Cas, I'll be fine. Don't do anything stupid."

He only gets time to see Cas's deeply worried eyes and creased furrows one more time, before he gets hustled downstairs, into the cellar -- more like dungeon, to be precise.

The guards dump them both into the utterly dark space, the only light coming from the open door.

"The lights are out --" the tall one leers at them from the top of the stairs, "you'll last longer with those."

A box of matches are thrown into the place, landing on the floor next to Amy's feet.

"What do you care?" Dean asks furiously.

"It's funnier." He grins with teeth, shutting the door. There is the sound of bolts slamming.

The place is drown by total darkness.

Dean/Doctor: "Doc" "Don't call me Doc, it's Doctor to you"

## Chap 6 The Roman In The Cellar

> (Dean POV)(Act 2 plot point 1)
>
> Dean/Amy goes to cellar where Rory was, the match in dark scene, Dean/Amy talk (realize Rory was there bc burned match), Dean protect Amy & zapped away
>
> chapter end last transition sentence, Cas/Doctor: "Where is Dean/Rory"

Amy strikes a match. The dancing flame lightens up a tiny corner of the place, dark shadow looming in from every direction. Dean never know a cellar can look so dreadful, boundless, and infinite.

They try to examine the space from the dim light.

There is a broken chandelier not far from the end of the stairs. The glasses shatter on the floor, leaving sharp pieces and shards all over like hidden blades, shimmering with flame's reflection. Another empty matchbox has been tipped upside down on the floor, a dozen charred match stumps scattering around it.

"Careful," Dean breathes. Amy startles, dropping the match.

The weak flame dies on the floor a second later. The utter black takes over. The sound of some distorted giggle and pitter patter of small stone feet stepping on the broken glasses comes from the darkness.

They gasp together. Amy strikes a second match.

From the flickering light, they see a small group of cherub statues crowding in on them. The little stone babies, barely can stand straight, lie around on the dusty floor, chubby little hands and legs entangled together. Looking as harmless and innocent as the ones from Bethesda Fountain looked like initially. But they know better than being fooled by the look.

They stare at the cherubs, edging slowly backward on the stairs, ascending to where the door is. Amy moves on higher steps, Dean follows her, keeping a barrier between her and the statues. His shadow stretches long in the faint flame and merges with the rest of the darkness.

Amy curses when the match burns her finger.

She drops the burned-down match and hurriedly strikes another.

The cherubs -- there are three of them -- have moved. They turned to where Dean and Amy are, frozen in the act of getting to their feet. Their tiny faces turn feral and full of fangs. Dean stares at them without blinking. But without a steady light source, this does very little help.

"We are dead," Amy says with a trembling voice. "The stone babies are going to send us back in time, and we'll just die of old age somewhere in the past. I'm never going to see Rory again."

Tears stream down her face.

The match burns out again. Her quiet sob mixes with the creepy giggles.

"We'll find a way," Dean stumbles up a few steps on the stairs in the complete darkness, blindly looking for the way, "The smart people upstairs, your Doctor and my -- and Cas, they'll think of something. We just have to last until they come."

Amy lights another match with unsteady fingers.

The cherubs reached the lowest level of the stairs, and the two of them have reached the highest, no more distance to put between them. The cellar door is shut tight and unmistakably latched from the outside, no way to open from inside. Their lives are as long as the match would last, until the baby statues climb up the stairs.

"How many matches left?" Dean asks.

"Does it matter?" Amy glances at the box and answers anyway, "Ten, maybe fifteen."

"Means one minute, maybe two." Dean thinks quickly.

He takes off his tie. "Burn this next," he tells her, "should buy us another two minutes."

Dean starts taking off his suit.

"What are you doing?" Amy panics.

"Improvise," he holds the suit jacket like a muleta, descending the stairs cautiously. "Just keep the light going."

Amy does as she's told. The cotton tie burns from the end, the flame is more steady than the one from the matches, but it still burns too quickly.

"I liked that tie," Dean tells the cherubs in grudge, "and this suit. Now I need to get a new one, and it's your fault."

He covers the baby angel statues with his suit, kneeling down to turn over the bundle, tying the sleeves and the lower hem together in a dead knot. And then leaves the bundle in the middle of the shattered chandelier's glass shards on the floor.

The light goes out just as he finishes the work.

"Come back quickly," Amy urges him, striking another match.

Dean stares at the cloth bundle as he moves back to the top of the stairs. The bundle didn't move in the blink of darkness between the lights.

Between that match burning out and them lighting the next, the bundle still remains in the same place, near the bottom of the stairs. They don't hear any giggle or pitter-patter either.

Amy lets out a long breath, "How do you know it would work?"

"I don't," Dean admits, "Lucky guess. Figured if they couldn't see us, they might lose the nerve to move, so took my chance. Or at least it will be a hell trying to climb up the stairs like that, have you seen three-legged race?"

"Nice job," Amy sits down on the top step, still holding the matchbox tight. There are still perhaps about ten matches left, and she doesn't want to stop lighting, even just for ten seconds of comfort.

"Hey," Dean puts a tentative pat on her shoulder, "we'll be fine."

"Thanks." Amy nods once, jaw still tight, "You know, Doctor says that a lot too, even when we first met, he said to me 'You know when grown-ups tell you everything's going to be fine, and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?' right before he said 'Everything's going to be fine.' I was only seven." She chuckles tightly at the memory.

"Was everything really fine then?" Dean asks, sitting down on the stairs one level lower than her. The cold cellar door is over their heads.

"Not really," Amy says, "there was a crack on my wall, which turned out to be a crack in the time and space, and then it killed Rory and wiped my memory, and he came back becoming a Roman robot, and we exploded the universe."

"Wow," Dean blinks, "that's gonna make my story of blowing up the Hell and letting Lucifer out sounds so lame. What happened next?"

Amy sniffs slightly, "We fixed it together. The Doctor saved the world, and we all went home. Rory and I got married, happily ever after."

Dean knows the sound of tears in a sentence when he hears one.

"And yet here you are --" He says slowly. He doesn't mean to pry, but it seems to calm her down.

"We tried," she tells him, "the normal life, we really tried when the Doctor was not around. Rory worked in a hospital, I had a blog. We spent a year in our house, watching a box." She trails off, Dean doesn't rush.

"It feels like yesterday," Amy continues, "it might actually *be* yesterday -- Tardis can send us back right when we left, so it would almost like we never left. But then the Doctor would drop by again, have a dinner, or watch TV with us. He doesn't have to say anything but we know he can't just leave us, and to be honest, how can you -- how can *anyone* -- stop following him around, traveling through all the time and space, fighting monsters, saving the universe? This 'other life', we call it 'Doctor life', it's part of me now. I think it's always been."

"It's like the hunter life and the normal life." Dean murmurs quietly, realizing the similarity.

They decided to save all the remaining matches for the moment, sitting quietly in the darkness on the top stairs. The air is quiet with only their breath and low voice. If the statues manage to shake off the wrap and move again, they should be able to hear them first. So for now, in the quietness and the darkness, they should be safe. Dean just wishes Cas and the rest of them can figure things out quickly on the other side of this heavy cellar door.

"You are a hunter?" Amy asks.

Dean nods, then remembers she can't see him in the darkness. "Yeah," he admits, "not really a FBI agent, sorry. Should have done a proper introduction back there. Hi, I'm Dean Winchester, I'm a hunter."

He holds out a hand in the dark blindly, meeting Amy's in the mid-way.

"Amy Pond, I'm um -- an adventurer."

They shake their hands.

"And the dude with me is Castiel, Angel of the Lord."

Amy stiffens reflexively when the word "angel" is mentioned. Dean notices it from the hands they connected.

"Sorry," he says quickly, "you know, it sounds really strange, the Weeping Angel and the actual angel I know, I was so used to angels being only dudes in suits like him."

Amy nods in understanding, then asks, "Are other angels all like him?"

"No, there is no one like him." Dean answers. "He's..." he trails off temporarily, "he rebelled, he fell, but he always come back to me. Always help me when I need him." A small smile crawls onto his lips that no one sees.

"Rory is like that too," Amy tells him, "I lost count how many times he's... gone." She chokes. The blackness brings the truth out easily. "You know, I crashed a van once, after he was killed. Because I decided, if that was the real life, I don't want it. I wasn't sure how I felt about him until he was gone, and at that time I never even told him I loved him. I don't know what I'd do without him. And lucky for me, it turned out to be an evil Dream Lord's dream world. I was so happy we got a second chance, then third, then fourth. I lost count, Rory was taken from me a lot, but he always comes back."

Dean stares at the pure darkness before his eyes, blinking hard, thinking he must be hallucinating to see images flashing by on the black curtain -- the rain of exploded flesh and blood, the floating trench coat on the lake water, the hand slipping from his palm. "I know what you mean." he replies, his voice hoarse.

He can feel Amy turn her head to him, cloth rustling. If they can see, her eyes must be searching his face.

Silence falls between them. They breathe shallowly and slowly. There is no sound or light in the cellar, as if time and universe doesn't exist in this small space.

Then Amy speaks again. "I've never loved by anyone like that before, it terrifies me." she says slowly. "We grew up together, I've known him my entire life, and then he waited two thousand years for me, alone, to save me. I didn't even know." There is the sound of tears dropping to the floor. She whispers, "He died for me so many times. How can you love back someone love you like that? Is that even possible?"

Dean swallows hard. "I don't know." His voice is a croak. "You save him back, whatever it takes."

Amy wipes her face, "You're right, now you get it why I *have* to save him. And," she pauses for a beat, "if for whatever reason I fail, or I get killed, or sent away by the Weeping Angels --"

"Amy --"

"Let me finish," Amy's voice is now firm and steady, though still wet, "can you promise to save him for me, and tell him that I loved him, and that I'm sorry, I tried, I died trying?"

"I --"

"Please?"

"Okay," Dean swallows the lump in his throat. "Okay. Amy Pond, I promise you. Is that why you're telling me all that?"

"I don't know, just in case." Amy says, a lot calmer than before. "And I will try my best to do the same for you and Castiel, if the worst comes."

She strikes a match right then, flashing bright both their solemn faces.

"What?" Dean is surprised, staring into her sparking eyes.

"I'm not blind, Dean," she says, looking into his eyes, "I see the way you two look at each other. It's the same way Rory looking at me, every time."

The match burns out.

Dean can hear blood pumping in his eardrum.

Except, it's not the pounding of his heart that he's hearing.

The cellar door above their heads are punched from the other side. There are noises of fighting and yelling. Metal dropping on the surface, something heavy collapsing onto the floor shortly after.

"Amy!" The Doctor shouts, followed by a series of familiar metallic whirling sound from the sonic screwdriver. "Amy, if you're in there, stay clear!"

Amy and Dean hurry back down a few steps in the darkness, covering their ears, looking up at their way out, waiting.

"Dean!" Cas's voice passes through the noises.

"Cas." Dean's heart skips a beat, jumping too lightly. Cas is okay, and he's coming for him, again.

The cellar door is blasted open, two metal plates flying into the space. Dean covers Amy with his body, getting a harsh hit on the back, throwing both of them down to the bottom of the stairs.

"Amy!" The Doctor thunders down, beaming the sonic screwdriver at the dark space like a torch, pulling Amy into a tight hug.

"Doctor," she clutches on his jacket, "it's so nice to see you again."

Cas follows into the cellar in a rush, looking around, asking in tense voice, "Where is Dean?"

Amy turns sharply, pointing behind her, "He's right here --"

But there is no one there. The air is empty where they landed from the blast.

The chilling giggles echo in the dark shadow.

"Angels." The Doctor hurries backward, taking Amy's arm, leading her back onto the stairs.

He points his sonic screwdriver lower, its green light shining on the broken chandelier. On the floor, near a wall by a pile of shattered glasses, a ragged suit jacket lies open, two cherub statues frozen in their gaze.

### Act 1

Unsteady on his foot, Dean staggers at the sudden change of the ground and chilly air. Humid outdoor air replaces the stale underground air, coming to his face.

One second he was ten feet from Cas, the next, he doesn't know where he is again.

For that blink of a second, he swears he saw Cas standing right there, at the opening of the stairs, stepping down hurriedly toward him. He wanted to call him, he wanted to laugh with joy that once again they escaped a dangerous situation, and right that moment, he felt a cold pull at the heel of his feet. And the ground spun under his feet.

He is outside -- still New York, undoubtedly, considering he can see the light from the Statue of Liberty on the Elise Island from across the water. He is at the south bay of Manhattan, then. The ground is wet with reflections glinting on the puddles, just like the after-rain road they first stepped on when Cas first flied them to 1938. So if he's lucky enough -- Dean puts a mental question mark on the assumption -- it might be the same rain, and he might still be around the same time, give or take. Fingers crossed.

The street view looks differently though. There is no more posh wealthy collector's mansion, only a much taller and much plainer-looking apartment building standing before him. Each window tight and small, tiling side by side like a beehive. Whoever lives in there, the space must be as small as single motel rooms. Dean feels bad for them.

A bright red neon sign reads "Winter Quay" hanging on the very top of the building.

There is barely any light coming out from the windows, with the majority of them closed tight and only a handful of them open. If he looks close enough, there are people sitting next to the windows, idly looking out. He has glimpses of some old people moving sluggishly behind the windows.

Not just any apartment building then, an elderly living building. Dean thinks, instantly feeling a prickle at the back of his neck. He doesn't like it, but he can't really tell why, just the usual hunter's instinct kicking in. Something about this building gives him the same feeling whenever they have to go into a haunted house -- the lingering sense of death and a creepy sense of something terribly wrong there. The places where most cases happen and people die. Talking about heebie jeebies.

He reaches for the back of his belt automatically, his fingers closing on empty air. The damned Grayle and his guards took his gun and phone, of course. Dean curses quietly, clenching his fist.

He doesn't like it -- he's all alone, weapon-less, backup-less, clueless. He doesn't know when and where he is, and there is this creepy-looking old people's house waiting for him to enter. The gate creaks open by itself as Dean looks, like an opening mouth waiting to swallow him in.

"Standard opening of a B-movie, replacing ketchup with blood. Great." He murmurs to himself, wondering if there is anywhere he can go other than stepping into the unquestionably biggest creepy house that looks like trying to invite him in.

There is fluttering sound of wings somewhere behind him. Dean turns sharply, but he can see nothing but trees jittering in the light breeze. The yellow bulbs of the street lamps are only bright enough to light up maybe twenty feet of the road around them. Something lurks in the dark shadow.

Dean turns back to the apartment building. The two angel statues standing by the gate have shifted their postures. Dean's pretty sure their hands were covering their faces before he turned, and now their hands are lowered, their faces showing. Their wings are furled close to their backs, both wearing long robes.

"More Weeping Angels." He curses, staring at both of them, not daring to blink the slightest. "Please don't tell me every single statue in Manhattan is a freaking Weeping Angel."

The dark night doesn't answer his question, only sending more movement behind his back. There is no way he'd turn around to check if it's more angel statues shaking the trees or just wind, with the two very adult-looking angels eying hungrily in his direction.

Walking inside the obvious trap seems to be the only option now.

Dean mentally calculates the route where he can walk into the gate of the building without looking away from both gatekeeper Angels. The conclusion seems to be impossible, but he bets his luck.

Dean walks toward the gate, feeling his eyes start to sore again. He blinks one eye at a time, barely wetting the dried eyes. The statues didn't move.

There is a stretch of stairs leading to the door, five steps, give or take. He has to measure the distance with the periphery of his eyes, keeping the focus remain on the statues. For the first time, he feels two eyes are not enough. He can't help wondering what Cas's "eyes in all directions" look like.

No way of keeping eyes on both angels now, Dean holds his breath and dashes into the gate, then takes a sharp turn the moment he's inside. He gasps as the gatekeeper angels stand right behind his back, face to face with fierce expressions. Their fingertips might only be an inch away from him, if he hadn't run faster than he ever did in his life.

Dean stares at their faces, and the statues remain still. "You are really some ugly sons of bitches, you know that?" He spits at the female angel statue with short curly hair. He imagines it might supposed to portrait some beautiful, fairy-tale looking, gentle, halo-and-harp style angel, and now, they are all nothing but monsters. The other male angel looks as strong and fit as Michelangelo's David, his socket deep and chasmal, his nose tall and straight. Dean has a weird feeling of familiarity but he can't quite place it.

He keeps the eye contact with both of them while backing up slowly, pulling one leaf of the door over, then the other, bolting them tight. Looking around, he spots a long loose pole lying by the doorframe. He blockades it on the door handles for good measure.

Regarding his work, Dean lets out a short relieved breath.

A man talks behind him, "It won't stop them, I tried."

Dean jumps and almost hits him in the face.

The Coffee Guy rubs his shoulder that just got punched, moaning in complaint.

"Sorry," Dean says apologetically, then recognizes him, "It's you. The Coffee Guy."

The guy raises his eyebrows, the same recognition dawns on him, a tight joy showing, "You're the one from the Central Park," then the raised tip of his lips quickly drops, "I'm sorry, if you're here, did you also get sent back by the Angels? River told me a little bit, but I got no idea..."

"No," Dean answers immediately, thinking about Cas's wings, but then the cellar, "Yes. Sorry, yes and no. It's a bit confusing."

"Rory Williams, also confused." The man holds out a hand.

"Dean Winchester." Dean shakes his hand, "Amy told me all about you."

Rory's jaw immediately tightens, "Amy is here too? Where is she? Is she safe?"

Dean holds up two hands in a soothing pose, "Calm down, she's okay -- at least last I saw her, Doctor got her."

"Doctor is here too?" Rory is visibly more relieved.

"Yeah, your whole big happy family, Amy, Doctor, River, everyone. You guys are having a family trip or something?" Dean can't help remarking.

Rory shakes his head, shifting his feet restlessly on the floor. "We were just hanging out in New York. Then everything went wrong, as usual." He looks a bit frustrated, but not irritated, as if already getting too used to being thrown into a rabbit hole of trouble.

"Things always went wrong, didn't they?" Dean seconds that in annoyance.

He looks around the place, examining the lobby they're in. It's a shabby place, bare and dusty, old already even as they're in the thirties, god knows how long the building has been built and probably no one has tended to it ever since. The typical look of a deserted place. Dean can't help wondering if those old people he caught sight of from outside by the windows, if they are ghosts or residents.

Dim street light passes into the space from a grimy clerestory window high above reach, near the ceiling. The metal plaque by the exposed elevator well shows at least seventy floors, with twenty to thirty rooms on each story.

Dean does a quick mental math and frowns deeply, "Holy, that's gonna be like two thousand people here." If the rooms are occupied.

"Why would anyone live in a place like this?" Rory asks beside him, staring at the same sign.

"Low rent?" Dean offers.

Right then, the gate rattles. The long rod he stuck on the handles is shaken loose. The door latches shudder like giants with great strength are shaking it from the outside, trying desperately to break in.

They gasp, hurrying toward the gate together, pushing with their backs to fight the door shut.

"Or the Angels force them to stay," Rory notes the obvious.

"Thanks, Sherlock," Dean grunts, pushing at one leaf of the door while Rory holds the other. "Any idea how to get out of here?"

Rory throws him an unhappy look, "I wouldn't be here if I know."

Dean squints at the new notice, "How long have you been here? You knew it wouldn't work when I blocked the door, you said you tried."

"I don't know, maybe minutes, maybe hours." Rory considers, "My watch stopped working, I have no idea."

Dean glances at his own watch. The fingers are not stopped -- they are moving, but they're moving pointlessly, they skip ahead then move back, they shiver at one point then suddenly start ticking again, then hesitate again. The watch has no idea about the time. *The time flux is scrambled.*

"Any idea what's the worst thing could happen if you get touched by one of those again?" Dean tries to prepare for the worst. Maybe they can still try to make a run, the brutal force way.

"Send you further back in time," Rory deadpans. "Why wouldn't they?"

Dean sighs, "So it's like the aeroplane chess -- get flown right back to the hangar. Friggin' Angels! The worst monster ever!"

The rattle on the door quiets for a moment, but they dare not move away.

Dean doesn't know how long he can keep holding on it. His muscles are sore. By the look on Rory's face, the man is about the same on the edge.

"Tell me about Amy," Rory says suddenly. "Tell me what she's like when you last met her."

"What, you want a heart-to-heart *now*?" Dean disbelieves.

"If the Angels break in and send me back again, that might be the last thing I'd ever heard about Amy ever again." Rory says as if it's obvious, "So yeah, I want to know as much about her as I still can. The memory would be all I ever have."

"What's the matter with you two?" Dean sighs, staring at the young man with a stubborn yet eager look in his eyes. "She said she loved you, more than anything." He tells him dutifully.

Rory's eyes brighten up like the Sun rising from the horizon. "She said that?"

"Why would I lie about things like that?" Dean's eyes study his face, even the tiniest crinkle glinting with happiness. Is it what love would do to a person?

Eyes unfocused on the dim air of the lobby, Rory says, "You know, sometimes I still can't believe how lucky I am. For a really long time, I thought she wouldn't ever love me the way I love her. Did she tell you we grew up together, and that we were always best friends?"

"Not the 'best friend' part." Dean swallows, feeling a funny twist in the gut.

"We were practically together every single day, I was always so happy to just *be* around her. But she never really looked at me that way. And you know what she said when she told people why we were just 'best friend'?" Rory pauses for a brief moment, not really waiting for an answer.

"Because she thought I wasn't into girls." Rory chuckles softly, "Because I never spared a look at any other girls."

"That's how she realized you love her." Dean guesses.

"Yeah. Like I can look at anyone other than her." Rory smiles, sinking in his memory. "Then we got engaged, then she ran away with the Doctor the night before our wedding."

"What?" Dean almost laughs, but he manages to stifle the chuckle at the last moment, "Isn't that too late for cold feet?"

"I think she was never really sure --" the gleams in Rory's eyes drop a few degrees, he stares at the dusty tiled floor, "-- or it's me that's never confident in her enough. When we travel with the Doctor, I always think one day she'd run away with him and never come back again, choosing him over me, choosing the 'Doctor life' over our normal life. I mean, why wouldn't she? The adventures and stars, killing monsters and saving the world -- that's the story of amazing Amy Pond. And silly old me? All I ever really wanted is living in a peaceful small town, with her, raising our babies, growing old slowly together. But I wasn't sure that's what she wanted too. And I was okay with it."

"But even so, you waited her for two thousand years." Dean remembers what Amy told him.

Rory nods like it's nothing.

"Why?" Dean can't help asking.

"Do you have anyone you'd do anything to protect them, save them whatever it takes?"

"I guess," Dean says, shifting his feet.

"Then you should know how it feels to leave them behind. I couldn't do that. So I stayed. I had to make sure she's safe." Rory answers easily.

"She doesn't even know." Dean says.

"It doesn't matter." Rory says with a firm voice, "To save her, I can do anything."

"Even condemn the world?" Dean doesn't know why this slips out of his tongue.

"Hopefully not," Rory thinks about it, "but if it means she's saved, then I don't know, maybe. Not like we haven't done it before."

Dean raises his eyebrows, "The 'exploding the universe' thing?"

Rory nods sheepishly, "More than once." Then adds quickly, "Sorry." As if afraid it personally offended Dean.

"Cool," Dean grins slightly, "I'm feeling so much better for jump-starting the Apocalypse, twice. And then my best friend let human-eating monsters out running around all over the world."

"We restarted the universe, though, for the record." Rory looks like compelled to add that, "No one remembers anything, history is back on track."

"And we locked the monsters back into the monsterland." Dean mirrors, "Cost me a year in that place though."

"Is that your version of 'waiting two thousand years'?" Rory detects the tone acutely.

Dean widens his eyes, a little surprised at the way he put it, but thinking it through... "Actually now that you said it," he says slowly, surprised again, this time at how accurate the analogy actually is, "Yes, it is."

"I just couldn't leave the place until I found him, but then I almost lost him again because he didn't want to be saved. If the angels didn't save him, he didn't come back to me again, I don't know what I'd do." Dean grimaces, doesn't know why he starts telling this stranger -- maybe already friend now? Since they've been sharing stories -- the things between him and Cas, but what the hell, they might die any moment anyway. Better than stew in dark and horror.

"I killed all the monsters I could hunt down to look for him, I think the whole Purgatory knew I was looking for him by the time I found him." Dean remembers the looks on those monsters' faces, the way they smirk and call him "his angel." Purgatory was pure, so pure that he couldn't even feel his cheek burn, because that was true. Cas was -- is, has been, and always will be -- his angel. *How can you love back someone love you like that? Died for you so many times? -- You save him back, whatever it takes.*

"I was an idiot," Dean laughs at himself quietly, "not seeing what it is. Or maybe I knew, all along, but never let myself see it."

Rory glances at him. "I'm glad you figured it out, mate." He says sincerely.

Dean ducks his head, "But how does that work out?" Because things are never easy and cut clean with them, aren't they? Even with that -- the new realization -- in mind, that still gotta be more trouble than he knows how to handle. There always gotta be complications and frictions, or things like ideal lives that you imagined differently. Everything standing in between -- sometimes it almost feels like the whole world stands in between them.

"It can't possibly be 'happily ever after.'" Dean says.

"We don't live in fairy tales," Rory gives him a look, "even Amy and I almost got divorced."

Dean drops his jaw. "How?" He doesn't need to deliver the whole question: I see how deep in love you two are, how can you two possibly walk away from each other? If even you two can't work it out, does that mean...?

Rory closes his eyes, refusing the pained memory, "We just... fell apart, I guess. Normal life happened, the Doctor didn't come to us for months, and we had a big fight. It happens."

"How did you fix it?" Dean stares at the middle of the dim shabby room, seeing holy fire burning around the angel in a circle. And the last look they shared before he left him there. He blinks the image away. He hopes never to see that look again.

"Oh, um, Amy almost got killed by the Daleks, and we saved each other," Rory replies evenly, "because I need her, and she needs me."

"Of course." Dean actually laughs. Of course. How can it be any other way?

Right then, the gate rattles harshly again, catching them in a moment of lax. It sways fiercely as if the strongest hurricane blows at it from the other side. The latch flies away and the door sways open.

Dean and Rory get shoved heavily away by the door leaves, thrown backward into the middle of the room.

Two Weeping Angels stand in the opened doorway.

<br>

### Act 2

"Don't blink!" Dean gasps, stumbling to his feet. Rory does the same, pulling himself up.

The two Angel statues are the same two standing guarded at the gate earlier, holding out their hands in the pose of pushing the door open. The female one has unfurled her wings slightly; the male one, without hands cupping his face, shows side-swept fringe on his forehead. Why on earth do they look familiar? Dean scratches his head.

"Why the hell are they just biting our tails?" Dean steps backward slowly, putting some distance between them and the statues, the distances that he has seen them cross within a blink.

He barks at them, "Come on, I didn't do anything to you."

"I don't think they care," Rory draws back by his side. "What do we do?"

The elevator well is a hollow metal structure, the classic ancient design from the thirties with bare bars and cables that is not protected with sealed sides. They might be able to climb in it to the second floor, but they'd be killed easily and nastily if the lift decides to drop or the angels flap their wings. That leaves only --

"The stairs. Where are the stairs?" Dean asks frantically.

"Locked," Rory breaks his last hope, "I checked before you arrive, all the doors are locked."

Of course.

Dean has backed to the wall right next to the elevator, punching blindly at the mounted buttons.

"Come on!!" He begs the damned thing.

He stares at the Weeping Angels without a blink. The two of them cast long shadows on the floor. The street lamp outside flickers dangerously. "No, no, no --"

The elevator comes to life like a miracle, clanking down to their level, opening the barred door.

"Go! Go!!" Dean yells, fingers fumbling on the wall, eyes on the Angels, moving toward the lift blindly.

Rory dashes into the lift, holding the door for him. "I got them, come on!"

Dean takes the last two steps, jumping into the ancient-looking metal cage.

The rusty bars clink clank before him, sliding closed. The lift starts rising.

"Which floor are we going?" Dean asks Rory.

"No idea," Rory searches the four sides in vain. There is no button or control handle inside.

A large human-sized poster at the back of the elevator gives them a jump. The Statue of Liberty on the image looks as realistic as the real thing. Too damn many statues in this city. Dean decides he would never come to New York ever again, if he manage to get out of here.

The wheezing sound of the old mechanics echoes loudly in the place, disturbing dust in the stale air.

Dean and Rory watches stories after stories rising into their view then being left behind. All have the same long, bleak look. An empty and straight corridor stretches in front of the lift on each floor, covered in thick scarlet velvet carpet. Not single person in view.

The lift comes to a halt at a floor near forty or fifty level high -- they lost count when it got above thirty. The thing doesn't seem to be willing to move further up, Dean and Rory have no choice but to walk into the corridor. The elevator clanks back down, leaving an dark, empty well in the space.

The bulbs on the ceiling give off smoky, tawny light, barely lighting the corridor.

Dean leads the way, looking left and right. The carpet muffles their footsteps, no wonder the whole place is quiet like a tomb. They don't even dare to breathe too loudly.

The doors have two-digit numbers on them showing the apartment numbers, and almost all have name tags labelled next to it: "W. Wallace", "J. Watson", "M. Wheeler", "J. Whittaker"...

Dean recognizes one from the missing people report he and Cas saw on the newspaper that morning -- this morning, this very same day's morning when he was having that awesome breakfast. God, that feels like ancient ago. At least it seems like he has found all the missing people then, if they are all in this very building. But how on earth can they get everyone outta here, with probably a million creepy Weeping Angel statues guarding the place and the whole Manhattan?

Dean shifts his attention to the end of the corridor. The light on the ceiling is not bright enough to shine up all the way toward the end.

"Dean --" Rory calls after him.

"Give me a sec." Dean says, walking cautiously toward the shadowed end wall. The instinct feeling growls in his brain like some answers crawling their way out, waiting for him to put the last missing piece into the puzzle. And something tells him the answer is *right there*.

The stone alcove in the wall blends in naturally with the rest of the decoration, looking exactly like a coherent part of the building -- as old and dusty as everything else is, covered by cobwebs.

Dean stands close enough to see there is an Angel statue sitting in the alcove, but not close enough to have a clear look at the face. This one looks particularly familiar, but her face is hidden in her palms. Her short, straight hair dangles down before her ears, reaching her shoulders.

Dean knows intuitively if the stone statue has colors, they would be dark black.

"Dean!" Rory raises his voice more alarmingly, half a corridor away from him. Distantly, the elevator dings again.

"Coming!" Dean answers without turning back, keeping his eyes on the statue.

Then he blinks deliberately.

The statue shifted its pose. The Angel has lowered her hands. She looked up from her sitting position, two hollow stone eyes looking straight at Dean. The hairs dropped from her face, showing soft lines of lips and face.

Realization hits him like a lightning.

"Tessa," Dean breathes out the Angel's name in shock.

That's what they are, the Weeping Angels -- the real angels, confined in a stone body, restricted by some quantum lock. But they're still the angels he knew, not some new monster species like the Doctor said.

"Oh God, I'm so dumb, of course," Dean gapes, backing away from the stoned Tessa, back to where Rory stands. That's exactly why he felt like he knew them, because he really does. The gatekeeper angels down there, aren't them the ones coming for Cas when he was broken? Inias or what's-his-name? And the other one with curly hair, isn't she the Angel of Water Cas pointed to him? The one called Hannah.

He claps on his head, "I have to tell Cas." Dean sends out a rushed prayer as he walks back down the corridor.

He is back next to Rory then, who points at two side-by-side doors with his mouth open. "Dean, look at that!"

"Watch out for that angel!" Dean tells him, then he turns.

Right on these two doors, the name tags unmistakably spell out:

"R. Williams"

and

"D. Winchester"

<br>

### draft notes

the gatekeeper angels of Winter Quay are Inias and Hannah, the alcove angel inside Winter Quay is Tessa

the elevator dings: make people think angels are coming up, actually Cas/Doctor/River/Amy coming up

### draft notes

why can't River comes back ten more minutes earlier: "You try ride motorbike in traffic like this? I can tear the world apart if I got one minute wrong."

future River comes, first sentence: "Hello, Sweetie. Again. What are you boys going to do without me?" sonic Grayle and knock him out. current River complain: "Oh I wanted to do it" future River: "You get to do it in ten minutes" warn them about paradox, whisper to her old self in the ear something ("it's gonna hurt")

During handling Grayle: Grayle: "I want to know if it can feel pain" Cas: "Do you realize she's screaming? The others can hear." (more visual description of the tortured angel) (after finish Grayle) Doctor to Cas: "You talk about it like it's alive" River: "Like it's your own kind" Amy: "You said 'she'" River: "What are you, really?" (Cas handle trust issue with Doctor/River/Amy when Dean's not there endorse/defend/help him) Cas might let slip: "She has a name!" the tortured angel is Hael, the mother-son statues are Mirabel and Samandriel

(Amy realize Rory was in cellar bc burned matches and Grayle's slipped "Those two, take them to the babies, like the other one.")

Amy accidentally read from the book that River has to break her wrist (book always with Amy now)

about book: "This isn't any old future, it's ours. Once we know what's coming, it's fixed."

Doctor/River: "Why did you lie to me?" "When one's in love with an ageless God who insists on the face of a 12-year-old, one does one's best to hide the damage" "It must hurt. Come here." "Yes. The wrist is pretty bad, too" "That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy. Nothing is gained by you being a sentimental idiot." (Doctor: "Not like I need it anymore" "No" "Yes. We both know I only get twelve chances, this is the last one, so it will be.")

River/Amy: "okay, why did you lie?" "Never let him see the damage. And never, ever, let him see you age. He doesn't like endings."

Amy: "Husband, run!" River: "Husband, shut up!" Dean: (swallow) others: (amused, glimpse at Dean/Cas) Dean: (blush)

loophole: don't need the device to find Winter Quay, it's in book chapter title → need to give a reason why can't use the known info (death in there not necessarily Dean/Rory? what's the luck?)

why infected/weeping angel sends people back/touch them: (Cas's theory) maybe not to harm them, but asking for help, angels have instinct to heal by touch, so they're looking for touch to self-cure, or they're too lonely, so they capture these humans to keep themselves accompany; (Doctor's theory) they feed on time energy, they capture these human for food source; (Dean's theory) they're and they've always been bastards, so they're just continuing being bastards, want to feed *and* attract more angels and hunters over, so they can spread the disease and get more food; or that's the karma for them, about time they pay for being assholes all these times (which pains Cas to think any of them deserve this bc he can hear the angels' screaming of pain even if they're not really alive as stones)

why weeping angels everywhere, Cas back from Purgatory only a week ago: time travel, if they exist at one point of time, they're in all the time, that's why no one knows where they come from: chronologically they didn't exist a week ago, that's the ground zero, but ever since then, they spread to the whole time flux

### references

Reuse River's confession lines when she doesn't recognize 12th Doctor in S09E13 "The Husbands of River Song", loving Doctor is like loving stars themselves, doesn't expect sunset to admire you back (Dean's the same with Cas): "The Doctor does not and has never loved me. I'm not lying. But **whoever said he loved me back? He's the Doctor. He doesn't go around falling in love with people.** And if you think he's anything that small or that ordinary, then you haven't the first idea of what you're dealing with. God knows where he is now but I promise you he's doing whatever the hell he wants and not giving a damn about me. And **I'm just fine with that.** **When you love the Doctor, it's like loving the stars themselves. You don't expect a sunset to admire you back.** And if I happen to find myself in danger, let me tell you, **the Doctor is not stupid enough, or sentimental enough, and he is certainly not in love enough to find himself standing in it with me!**" "Hello, sweetie." "You are so doing those roots." "What, the roots of the sunset?" "Don't you dare." "I'll have to check with the stars themselves." "Oh, shut up."

## Chap 9 The Angels Take Manhattan

> (Dean POV)(Act 2 plot point 2+Act 3 twist)
>
> weeping angel besiege attack (kill all NYC lights first), all escape to roof, the Statue of Liberty attack, Cas show true form, stare all directions with all eyes, everyone shut eyes (Rory/Amy love talk, Dean/Cas hear), but Cas can't keep doing that, eventually can't maintain true form in this plane (Doctor can sonic a few to send them away but not enough, detail for later)
>
> start the paradox talk here (River talk about how it's like to love Doctor, observable, related), get confirm if he dies now he create paradox, Dean already starts considering suicide to save the world (but still a little hesitant), Cas doesn't let him, huge argue
>
> the Statue of Liberty almost touch Dean/Rory, Cas jump in front of him, get turned into statue too, Dean/all stare at him, Cas can't move
>
> Cas's stonization isn't instant, start from feet up, can't move, eyes the last, Dean has to witness the process, it's painful for both, that's why Cas has time to spread the wing before the process complete so his statue shows protective wings for Dean

### draft notes

(Liberty is Naomi)

Cas buy them time by using all his eyes in his true form to stare at all sculptures all at once so none of them can move again, so the sacrifice is he can't move either (not a solution, so give up)

Dean has to stare at Cas too when Cas is weeping angel. Not blinking, stare save the day

Cas is a "good" weeping angel with them (same as when with normal asshole angels) → deliberately turn off the light and/or close their eyes, and let Cas be free and move, Doctor/etc. freak out, Cas take care of other bad angels, Dean win the bet because he has faith (BAMF Cas)

## Chap 10 Death At Winter Quay

> (Dean POV)(Act 3 climax)
>
> Liberty continue attack, all think no way out, Dean trust Cas, ask them all for faith, look away from Cas for a sec, Cas disappear, Liberty & other statues disappear, Cas move back, still statue
>
> Doctor wants to sonic Cas, Dean furious, think Doctor wants to hurt him (happened before to other angels before), but actually to link his time energy to call Tardis, can bring them all back to 2012 (but can't cure Cas)
>
> Dean finalizes the decision to suicide to save Cas (hesitant for saving world, determined if it saves Cas)
>
> Dean/Rory argue who to sacrifice, Amy/Rory willing jump together
>
> a few deliberate blink scene sequence, Cas move to him, want to hug but can't, weeping/crying, Dean jump the building
>
> (for a sec make it looks like not working)

### draft notes

Cas sending most angels back in time, clear the city of weeping angels, Doctor: "Guess it's solved, more or less" Dean: "More or less? What does that mean? Will they come back?" Doctor: "Technically they can, but if Cas stays here, he can send them back again. Probably should call him Guardian Angel of Manhattan now." Dean: "But what about Cas?" "What about him?" "Will he ever come back normal? Un-stoned?" Doctor: "I'm sorry" Dean: "No" "What do you mean 'no'?" "I mean no, if this is the reality, I don't want it, I'm going to bring him back" "I know it's difficult to lose someone..." Dean: "No you don't! I'm not going to leave him again, not ever again! We come here together, we go home together. I'm not leaving him in this bloody 40s New York like this. I'll do it, whatever it takes. I'll save him, whether you like it or not."

Dean's strongest reason to sacrifice instead of Amy/Rory: You have each other, I have no one now. If it doesn't work, try something else, help him, and maybe let my brother know. (give Doctor his phone)

"To save you, I could do anything." -- Rory/Dean

## Chap 11 Last Farewell

> (Dean POV)(Act 3 wrapping up)
>
> timeline reset, everyone back to 2012, Doctor confirm time flux explosion kill most weeping angels, Dean worry about *most* may not include Cas. Not see Cas immediately, Dean worried
>
> Cas finally show up, still weeping angel, Dean panicked; Doctor suspect bc he's in the center of the timeline explosion, might be "survivor" not recovered, Dean suggest another paradox to fix him, Doctor warn it will rip earth apart, Dean: "I save the Earth enough times, about time it saves us for once"
>
> Cas statue hold hand as if want to touch Dean but restrain himself, Dean willingly approach, want to be touched, even if he may get zapped back; then the moment they touch, Cas start reverting, bit by bit, reverse process of stonization
>
> Cas back normal, disoriented, actually weeping, bc overjoy Dean's alive again but hate to see him die for him again; dean overjoy Cas's back
>
> Doctor/River bicker (book→deliver to Dean/Cas's motel room), Amy/Rory resign (farewell→fulfill last chapter), Dean/Cas confession (→go to Sam), HE

### draft notes

destiel reunion: hug "Don't do that again" "Same goes for you"

Doctor/Cas: "see you next time, somewhere in the universe, some time in the future or past" "Look forward to it, Doctor" smile and wave goodbye

Dean/Cas mutual confession: Dean's realization enlightened by Amy from Chap.6 and Rory from Chap.7, Dean start understand feelings since Chap.7

Amy/Rory make the decision to leave Doctor bc of Dean/Cas, importance of family (talk about Rory's dad Brian, "Don't you have anyone waiting for you to come home" "My dad waters plants for us"), Dean/Cas decide to call Sam and reunite together bc of Amy/Rory

about Sam: Dean ask about Rory's family here, Rory mention Brian, topic of family → lead to the ending: Rory/Amy's final decision of leaving Doctor, and Dean/Sam reunite; follow-up conversation about normal life vs adventure, talking about "the other life" and maybe the truth is not about whereto but runaway, make Dean think Sam → lead to: understand/call Sam, Dean realize he's angry/jealous/unfair to Sam (extend a bit more to show Dean/Cas actually visited Sam before heading out), but now that he realizes he has Cas, they don't *have to* choose, they can have both (similar to Rory/Amy)

when talk about why not talk to Sam and let him think he's dead, Dean: "He'd never be truly happy if I'm alive. He'd never live the life he wanted if I'm alive. Now I can't really damn myself, so this is the second best thing I can give him." Rory: "You dumb thing. Do you really think he'd ever be truly happy again when he believe you're dead?" Dean quiet

witty comments about how come the cheapest hotel sounds like 5-star penthouse; you can't live in anywhere too far away from any landscape in Manhattan (about where to deliver the book in timeline)

### references

Brian looks to the Doctor, so serious: "What happened to the other people who travel with you?" Doctor: "Some left me. Some got left behind. And some... not many but... some died.  (off Brian's horrified look) Not them. Not them, Brian. Never them." ending: Doctor: "I know. You both have lives here. Beautiful, messy lives. This is what makes you so fabulously human. You don't want to give them up. I understand." Brian: "Actually, it's you they can't give up, Doctor. And I don't think they should. Go with him. Go save every world you can find. Who else has that chance? Life'll still be here." Doctor: "You could come, Brian." Brian: "Somebody has to water the plants. Just... bring them back safe." (S07E04)

## Afterword (Not a Chapter)

> (use as epilogue, letter format?, like Amy's letter to the Doctor from the past)
>
> some possible follow-ups (with some time jump?): Brian/Rory/Amy dinner, Rory/Amy/Doctor/River Christmas, Doctor/Cas meet in time flux maybe even for help, Sam/Dean/Cas reunite & intro to Sam's new life, surprise: Amy/Charlie meet

## Deleted Scenes (Not a Chapter)

> (post all the unused witty comments and small interactions)
>
> (mention the timeline fits the air date of both shows)

### draft notes

Dean: "Let me get this straight. You save the universe but only save the UK part, fly across galaxy is close enough but USA is too far away? This isn't your jurisdiction or something? Pal, not I'm saying, you did a terrible job in protecting the earth, in case you didn't notice, it at least trashed twice if we didn't ..." Doctor: "All due respect, who's behind that? Also, USA almost trashed twice doesn't mean..." River/Amy: "Don't mind him, London gets trashed every Christmas, it's a Doctor and Monster thing." Dean/Cas: "You can say that again."

Dean wrt Doctor/River: "I guess a thousand year age difference isn't a problem then." "You got anything to say about that?" "What? No, no, of course not." (Dean unintentionally glance at Cas, finding him look at him too) "We were married when I was half-way killing him and he was trying to save the world. It's complicated." Dean grins: "Isn't it always?" (unintentionally meet Cas's eyes again)

patch: why Tessa the reaper is considered an angel: reaper is angel of death; why reaper go to Purgatory to save Cas: second-hand infected by other angel/reaper in interaction
