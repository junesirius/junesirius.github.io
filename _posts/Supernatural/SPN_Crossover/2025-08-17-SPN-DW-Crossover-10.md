The loud pounding of stone on the service door continues. And with a final push, the door flies. The angels march toward them fast whenever they blink or look away. There are too many of them.

"No way we can stare at all of them at the same time, Doctor!" River cries.

The Doctor aims his sonic screwdriver at one of them and sends it flying. But the next one is already in its place before he steadies his step. They spread out, making it even more difficult to keep an eye on everyone of them.

"Okay, I'm going, that's the only way." Rory starts climbing up the low wall at the edge again.

"No, wait! There is another, if you trust me. If all of you trust me, and I trust Cas," Dean says loudly, looking away from Cas.

"What are you talking about?" River shouts back at him.

"Have a little faith. And don't look at Cas for a second, that's all I ask," Dean smiles a little. It's a bet, but it's on Cas. He's willing to bet the world on Cas at any time. So why not this time, too?

"You are asking us to trust a Weeping Angel?" The Doctor glances at him unbelievably.

"I'm asking you to trust someone who's kind enough to help find your friend when we didn't have to, to fly all of you to 1938 when none of you can, to risk getting turned into a statue to protect me and everyone here, who's willing to sacrifice himself to save the world without blinking. I'm asking you to have a little faith in Cas, that even infected, he's on our side," Dean tells them firmly, pleadingly.

"Okay," Amy says, turning to the other side. So does Rory.

"I trust him," River follows quickly.

The Doctor sighs. "Do I have a choice?"

The statue of Cas disappears immediately.

Dean prays quietly. *Come back to me. Save the world, and come back to me. Let me save you, too.*

They blink. Half the besieging angels disappear from the rooftop.

They blink again. The remaining ones are also cleared out.

"Where did they go?" Amy asks loudly.

"He must have sent them away," River answers, amazed. "You can send people away, which means you can send anything away. And he's sending the other angels away."

"What about that big one?" Dean points at the Statue of Liberty -- at the bastard angel named Naomi.

"No reason he can't. The size shouldn't matter," the Doctor answers him.

Between one second and the next, the space that was occupied by the gigantic statue is wiped clean. So hollow and empty that Dean feels as if the chunk of space has been swallowed.

"People waking up tomorrow are gonna ask where the Lady Liberty goes," Dean jokes.

"At least there *are* still people waking up tomorrow," River answers.

Dean hums an agreement.

And then, Cas comes back.

Still statue, still with wings, though now tugged behind his back. His hands cover his face, as if he's weeping. The perfect image of a Weeping Angel.

Dean stares at him, regarding his shape. He's not broken or hurt, and his trench coat and suits look just like a natural intrinsic part of him. His hair is ruffled as it used to be. He might be a statue, but he looks just like when he's alive. And it makes looking at him even more painful.

The Doctor points his sonic screwdriver at him.

Dean jumps in front of Cas, facing the Doctor furiously with his arms open around Cas in a protective gesture. "He just saved all of us! Don't you dare hurt him!"

The Doctor blinks at him, then realizes. "What? No, of course I'm not hurting him. I was trying to link all the temporal energy he collected from sending other angels away to give Tardis a parking light. To get our flight ticket."

"We can all go back to 2012 now?" Dean asks dumbly.

"If you want," The Doctor answers plainly. "Since the situation is solved, more or less. I don't want to stay here another minute."

"'More or less'?" Dean parrots. "What does that mean? Will they come back?"

The Doctor says, "Technically, they still can, but if Castiel stays here, he can send them back again. Probably should call him Guardian Angel of Manhattan now."

Dean squints at him. "But what about Cas?"

"What about him?"

"Will he ever come back normal? Un-stoned?"

The Doctor looks down, voice quiet. "I'm sorry."

Dean says, "No."

The Doctor glances at him. "What do you mean, 'no'?"

"I mean -- NO. If this is the reality, I don't want it." He throws a quick look at Amy. "You taught me that. I'm going to bring him back."

The Doctor starts: "I know it's difficult to lose someone..."

Dean cuts him off harshly, "No, you don't! I'm not going to leave him again, not ever! We come here together, we go home together. I'm not leaving him in this bloody thirties New York like this. Paradox or whatever it takes, I'll do it. Whether you like it or not."

"I was trying to save you!" The Doctor defends.

"And I am trying to save him!" Dean says firmly. "We are here because we want to help you, so now, help me save him."

"You'll kill yourself," the Doctor says simply.

"Fine," Dean moves up the low wall at the edge of the building quickly, without hesitation.

"You weren't going to kill yourself for saving the world, but you'd do it to save him?" River says.

Dean thinks about it, realizing that's true. He shrugs. "He means more than the world to me."

"You should let him know," River says gently. "He would love to know."

Dean actually smiles. "Next time when I get the chance, I will."

"Maybe I should do it," Rory says suddenly. "Then you can have that chance."

"Rory!" Amy objects loudly.

"No," Dean says firmly, turning to him. "Thanks for offering, but no. You have each other; I have no one now. Besides, we don't even really know if it would work. If it doesn't, try something else for me, please, save him. And, oh --" he takes out his phone, tossing it to Rory, "-- maybe let my brother know, too. Tell him I'm sorry."

He stands straight on the wall. The whole of New York feels it's at his feet. The night wind flows around the skirt of his shirt. The Chrysler Building stands silently behind him under the night sky.

"Cas --" Dean says, looking at the statue of Castiel, and closing his eyes deliberately, thinking hard. "Thank you for everything you did for me. This time, let me do this one thing for you."

He opens his eyes. Cas has moved to him, the stone wings are frozen in a spreading pose, his hands reaching out, opening like a hug, marks of tears frozen on his face. But he's careful enough not to touch him.

The only Weeping Angel that is actually weeping, is because Cas is crying for him.

Dean leans in, kissing the cold stone of Cas on the forehead, and he says with a small smile, "Goodbye, Cas."

Take a breath.

Take a step.

He topples over the edge.

For a horrifying second, there is only silence. Then, screams from below, screeches of cars braking and swerving, horns blaring.

Amy covers her mouth, eyes shut in unbearable horror. Rory pulls her into his embrace.

"Oh God!" River yells breathlessly.

The stone statue of Cas cracks before their eyes, starting from the chest where the heart is. The crack extends over his body and his wings. And with an explosion sound, the statue that forms Cas breaks apart into fragments.

That is when lightning flashes through the air, surges of energy pulsing around the place, light glowing blindingly bright, the whole building starts shaking.

"What's happening?" River shouts over the sound of electricity cracking.

"The paradox!" The Doctor is grinning, wild with ecstasy. "The paradox is working!"
