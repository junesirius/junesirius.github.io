Cas lets go of Dean's hand.

They look around.

The Doctor busies himself around a central structure that Dean's pretty sure is where all the engines and control units are -- if any of the sci-fi movies has any truth in them. A huge, bright pumping pillar with glass spheres vibrate up and down, making loud whirring sound -- that's the sound they heard when the whole thing just materialized itself around them.

Dean watches the structure moving, walking slowly toward the console table and the Doctor running around it. "Does all your toys have to make funny noises?"

Amy can't hold back a small laughing sound on the other side of the table.

The Doctor rolls his eyes at Dean, offended, "This is Tardis! Of course she has to make this beautiful sound! What do you know about 'Time and Relative Dimension in Space'?"

Dean stutters, "Ugh, come again?"

The Doctor grins, "Like I thought. If you don't know anything about her, don't make rude comments! She might be upset."

"She might be upset if you keep the brake on when landing. That's where the noise comes from." Cas follows Dean up the steps around the console, pointing at a handle on the desk. "Type Forty model's common problem."

The Doctor narrows his eyes at Cas a second time of the day. He unleashes the handle to the opposite direction, the noise quiets just like Cas said. "What are you?" The Doctor asks cautiously, "I don't think I've ever met your kind before."

"I'm an Angel of the Lord." Cas answers potently.

Dean adds, "He's with me." He squares his shoulders, feeling oddly proud.

The Doctor eyes both of them carefully, as if only now does he properly register them. "Relative of the Weeping Angels?" He asks, not in the most friendly tone.

"I don't think so." Cas says, "I've only known them the first time today."

"But you know a lot of things, you know about the Time Lords and Tardis." the Doctor purses his lips. "I don't like it."

Cas lowers his head a little, "That was unexpected knowledge to me as well, back when I was the God. Long story."

Amy whispers to Dean, "Don't mind him. He's just jealous, he doesn't like *not* being the smartest man in the room."

Dean grins, putting a hand on Cas's shoulder. "Alright, you two, enough peacock time. What are we all doing in here? Thanks for not leaving us behind, by the way, I wasn't sure about that."

The Doctor rolls his eyes at him, "Of course I wouldn't do that, what do you take me for?"

Dean shrugs.

Amy answers on the Doctor's behalf, "You said the angels sent Rory back, and we think the cherubs don't have enough power to send him too far back, so we might still have a chance to find him and save him -- good thing that Tardis is a time machine. So we only need to find out exactly when and where, Doctor thinks he can trace back the temporal signal, but it takes some time to calculate."

She gestures to the console panel where the sonic screwdriver is plugged in, a display screen on top of it showing some running patterns, presumably working like a computer.

Dean looks at the screen for a few moments, realizing he can't read a thing -- they're not even in English, the patterns with circles and lines are as beautiful as stars but gives no clue. He tilts his head and whispers to Cas, "It's like watching Sammy do the research, all the nerdy science stuff."

Cas hums softly, showing a fond smile at the mention.

Dean claps his hands, "Alright, what do we do while waiting then? You gonna give us a tour around the ship or something? Tell me you have booze here." He moves away from the console, curiously sneaking a peek at the spiral staircase on the other side of the room leading upward.

The Doctor snorts, "That is so American."

Dean rolls his eyes, "What, you drink tea instead?"

Amy notices his earlier words, "You think it's a ship?"

Dean looks around the spherical space they're in -- which has a ton of round decorations on the curved walls and the ceiling as if they're inside a huge sphere at least three floors tall, he wonders if anyone on the Bethesda Terrace would have noticed this probably enormous alien-looking, time-travel space ship, but he decides if their alien techniques are as advanced as he shows, they're probably invisible.

Dean nods at the surrounding to make a point and looks back at Amy, "A time-travel space ship, yeah? What else can it be?"

Amy winks with a mysterious smile, "Just wait till you see the outside."

Dean turns to Cas in confusion. But even Cas has a mischief curve on the tip of his lips.

Dean rolls his eyes at Cas, "Not you too."

The curve widens slightly on Cas's lips, and he says, "You can see for yourself once we're outside. Don't want to spoil the fun part."

Dean pretends a long sigh, turning back to Amy, "You remind me of someone. She's like a sister to me, also red hair, I think you'd like her if you stick around longer."

Amy smiles small, giving him an appreciated nod, stepping toward one of the round structure on the wall. She presses on some of them, as if looking for the correct the password combination to open something. "I think River has some stock somewhere --"

The Doctor looks up at her, confused, "What do you --"

That's when Amy successfully opens the stock, showing a hidden cabinet of delicate bottles of liqueurs.

Dean admires the collection, grinning, "Look at that." All the top-shelf fine collections, nothing he'd spot in places they'd usually go -- in fact, now that he thinks about that, being on some alien's ship, these might not be from Earth.

He pours himself a glass, appreciating the flavor, "Whoever this River dude is, he certainly has taste."

"She --" Amy emphasizes, "is my daughter."

Dean is taken aback a little, mentally measuring Amy's age, trying to do the math. "Is she even to the age?"

"And my wife." The Doctor adds.

Dean stares at him, then looks back and forth between the Doctor and Amy. "Wait, that means you two are --"

"Mother-in-law, I know." Amy's face drops unhappily for some reason, "Time travel thing, it's a long story. Two thousand years long, actually, not sure I want to talk about it, especially when Rory is not here."

"Time travel is never easy, isn't it?" Cas suddenly comments. He's been watching them quietly for some time. "Always so much regrets in the past you'd want to change, but you just couldn't save everyone, and you can't change the fix points even if you can travel back in time."

The Doctor gives him a deep look. "Indeed." He says. The words are simple but his tone is rattled.

Their eyes meet, both as aged as the length of the universe itself. There is a moment of understanding.

Dean watches them, suddenly realizes with more clarity than ever -- Cas is old, real old, as old as the Earth and Sun and the beginning of all the Time and Universe. And here he is, standing in the room, walking and talking. That Doctor has probably seen just as much time and universe to have eyes as sad and deep. He swallows. He's just a human.

Dean takes a gulp at the drink. The liqueur smooths down his throat, but it's still dry.

"You lost someone, didn't you?" He asks.

The Doctor shoots him a pained look. "I'm hoping not anymore." he says, and his eyes linger on Amy's back for a moment too long.

The four of them fall quiet for a brief moment, only hearing the tiny tinkling sound from the Tardis. And then it beeps loudly, with a red flashing sign.

They jump to their feet toward the console.

"That doesn't look good." Dean comments. Whatever it is, red flashing thing is never a good thing.

The Doctor looks closely, Cas stands next to him, reading the screen.

"What does it say?" Amy urges, "Did it find Rory?"

"April the third, 1938, old-town New York" Cas reads the message, frowning.

Dean claps his hands, "Good, we have the time and location, let's go. What are we waiting for?"

The Doctor unplugs the sonic screwdriver from the control panel, beaming its head toward the screen. The familiar whirring sound echoes again, the floor feels bumpy like airplane in turbulence. Then the red warning screams louder, and the floor they're standing on start shaking violently in all directions. The lighting inside the whole space blink on and off as the floor shakes, turning to a dark red color.

Amy and Dean have to grab the closest handrail to steady themselves, the Doctor and Cas lean on the console.

The Doctor yells over the loud emergency sound. "She doesn't let us land. It's like a storm blizzard out there. Hang on."

Cas puts both his hands on the metal handle he pointed out earlier -- the brake, apparently. The shaking eases for a few seconds, but almost immediately turning into a sideward spinning. All of them fall to the floor; the handle is let go, shifting up and down rapidly on its own.

The Doctor takes out a hammer from underneath the console, striking on the surface. "This usually works!" he yells.

"You are making it worse!" Cas yells back.

The console makes an extremely loud explosion sound, together with a strong burning smell and dark smoke bursting from the burned control, the brake handle flies to the ceiling and lands on the floor in two pieces.

The whirring sound slows down, so does the spinning wall. They can do nothing but to grasp whatever they hold on to for their dear lives.

Dean clutches the handrail with whitened knuckles, thinking how bad this idea is to land an alien ship. He doesn't even like to take airplanes, why does he enter a spaceship which doesn't even have a seatbelt.

Amy falls not far from him, clinging to the same handrail as he does. In the first bout of spinning and crashing, Amy slipped right near his side. So Dean has enough of distraction trying to give the lady a soft landing to not completely freak out.

And then the floor comes to rest. So are the spinning vibrating spherical things in the center of the control pillar, which -- if a spaceship works the same way as a car -- probably means the engine has stopped when the brake blew off. The room is filled with smoke.

"Out! Out!!" The Doctor dashes to the door, pulling it wide, urging all of them out. In his hand, there is a fire extinguisher.

Dean and Amy rush out of the door, Cas follows closely after them. The Doctor yells at the control panel: "Extractor fans on!!" The loud noise of fans rumbles to life on his command.

"What the hell is that?" Dean demands, stumbling out, coughing violently because of the smoke, catching himself on the knees. Cas hurries toward him, whispering to ask if he's hurt, and Dean waves him off because he's fine.

"1938, we just bounced off it." The Doctor pokes his head out of a blue box, white foams and dark smoke flying in and out of the opened door.

Dean straightens up when he finally catches his breath.

They are in the middle of a graveyard, countless tombs and stones lying around them. Statues of angels and decorative figures stand at the border of the yard, in the stance of mourning and protecting. New York skyscrapers can be seen over the horizon.

"Where are we?" Amy asks.

"2012, back where we started." the Doctor tells them.
