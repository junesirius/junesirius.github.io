A loud pounding on the closed door. The door shakes, looking like it's not going to hold for much longer.

The light from Cas dims rapidly. His wings slump down, almost drooping completely to the ground. The color in his eyes waned to no more than a glint that's barely there. The eyes on his wings blink sluggishly. Cas drops to his knees, not having enough strength to even hold his body straight. It's exhausting him fast.

Dean rushes to lend him a shoulder, having his arm around Cas's shoulder and waist.

"Turn that off, Cas! It's burning you up!" Dean yells at him, shaking him a little.

Cas closes his eyes tiredly. His wings disappear, so do the eyes and light. The rooftop suddenly looks as dark as the night. They realize the power of the whole city has been cut. The city that never sleeps has become the city of darkness.

"I'm sorry," Cas staggers when he tries to stand still by himself, his voice hoarse and dry, like sandpaper rubbing. Dean can smell a taste of bloody iron just being this close to him. How many new wounds has Cas added to himself just by lighting himself up? Burning away some internal organs without him knowing, maybe?

"Stop burning yourself up!" Dean snaps, and Cas winces. Dean immediately gentles his voice. "I mean you did great, but I need you alive, you hear me? Still need you to fly us home, remember?"

Cas gives him a tired, apologetic look. Dean can feel the gaze from the Doctor and River. All saying the same thing -- they are probably not going to go back now.

"No, there must be a way," Dean thinks aloud.

"The paradox," Rory meets his eyes, walking cautiously toward the edge of the rooftop.

"What are you doing?" The Doctor raises his voice alarmingly.

"Rory?" Amy queries.

"Keep your eyes on the Statue!" Rory glances down, and Dean watches him closely.

"Is there a way down?" Amy asks without looking back.

"Uh, no," Rory answers hesitantly.

"But there's a way out," Dean says for him.

Rory carefully walks toward the low wall skirting the edge of the building, ready to climb up.

Amy turns around sharply, tears in her eyes. "Rory, what are you doing? Stop it! You'll die."

"Yeah, exactly." Rory smiles shakily. "Twice in the same building on the same night. Who else could do that?"

Dean lets go of Cas, walks carefully toward him, holding out a hand to grab him at the edge of his shirt. "Actually, I can."

"Stop it, both of you!" The Doctor yells.

"Dean!" cries Cas.

Rory meets Dean's eyes, then turns back to Amy. "This is the right thing to do. This will work. If I die now -- " Dean cuts him off by "if one of us dies now", Rory continues, "-- it's a paradox, right? The paradox kills the angels. River said so. Tell me I'm wrong, please, 'cause I'm really scared."

Amy stands before him, holding his hand. "Stop it! Just stop it!"

Dean adds a little more force to the grip he has on this brave man, and it makes his head clearer than ever. "Come down here, Rory. I should be the one jumping down."

"Dean, no!" Cas yells desperately.

Dean turns around to face Cas, who stands just a step away from him now, looking at him, devastated.

"It's okay, Cas." Dean finds his heart suddenly so light and bloated. It feels easy. It feels the right thing to do. "This will work, this will kill the infected angels."

"It will kill you too!" Cas snaps.

"Will it?" Dean glances over his head. "They said this place would be erased from time, never exist. Angels are never infected. If this place never existed, what did I fall off?"

"You think you'll just come back to life?" Cas's lips tremble. Dean realizes that's exactly where his stare has always landed, focused on, longed about.

"When don't I?" He smiles easily.

"Dean --"

"And compare to the other life? Living downstairs, dying of old age, never seeing you again? What life is that? I've never imagined a long life anyway. Swinging out in a glory, Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid style, that's exactly what I've been imagining anyway."

"Maybe there are other ways! You don't have to!" Cas says, voice choking.

"I want to," Dean tells him, gentler now. "It can save you, too."

"Save me?"

"That's the bad witch right there, right?" He glances at the Statue of Liberty. "That angel Naomi? Chasing you around, hurting you? Don't you think it's about time to kick her ass?"

Cas's eyes glint with tears. His hands reach out to hold Dean's, grabbing him tight. And he says, "I won't let you die. I can't."

Dean is almost amused. "I don't think I need your permission."

Right then, the ground shakes again. The whole building shakes. When none of them are looking, behind them, a huge shadow of a large claw falls toward them, unmistakably aiming at Rory and Dean.

Amy shouts, while Dean tries so hard to snatch his hand out of Cas's grip. He's still two steps away from the edge of the building -- too far to cross in the blink of an eye, if they blinked. And the angel is too fast.

As fast as any other angel, Cas takes action. An outrageous roar comes out of him, and his wings spread out from his shoulder blades again, wide and vast, covering the humans on the rooftop like a protective shield.

Before Dean can register what has happened, the touch of Naomi lands on Cas's wings.

He knows it from the way Cas's whole body stiffens. He looks at Dean in a horrified look, and his wings start turning into stone before his eyes.

"NO --!" Dean yells desperately. "No, no, no, no, no -- this is not happening! Cas!"

The tip of that beautiful, soft-looking wing turns into marble, extending fast across the feathers, freezing him in place. Dean stares at him, and Cas can't move an inch.

Dean reaches a hand to him intuitively.

"Don't touch him!" the Doctor yells behind him. "He's a Weeping Angel now! He can send you anywhere!"

"I don't care! He's Cas!" Dean growls back, taking back his hands, cupping Cas's face, where the stone hasn't reached yet, where the skin is still soft and warm, still in a human body. He wonders why he's never done this before.

Cas blinks tiredly at him, saying in a low voice. "He's right, Dean. I'm infected now, I could harm you. You shouldn't touch me."

"When could you ever hurt me?" Dean smiles back, almost chuckling, almost teary. "Remember that time when Heaven took you back? The first day you came back, you said 'You serve Heaven, you don't serve man, certainly not me,' and the next thing you did, you helped me."

A mirroring smile shows up on the tips of Cas's lips. "I don't know you remembered."

"Of course I do," Dean says gently, too soft, too choked. He swallows rapidly. "I remember everything about you."

"That time, that's Naomi too," Cas tells him. "She took me back, 'fixed' me, so that I could remember my priority is to save the angels, not the humans."

Dean scoffs. "Looks to me she's the one needs fixing."

The texture of stone covers Cas's body fast, from his feet to his hands, crawling up his neck toward his head next. Cas can't move at all except for blinking and holding a tight smile.

Cas chuckles quietly. "There is something I want to tell you, Dean. But I think we're running out of time."

Tears fall down on Dean's cheek. "I'll save you, Cas. You're not dead, I'll find a way and I'll fix you. I promise."

Cas looks him in the eyes, and answers gently, "Goodbye, Dean."

Right then, the stone covers his whole face, freezing his blue eyes into cold marble color.

Dean can't help but let out a loud cry of pain. "CAS!" His heart clenches so hard he can't breathe.

The statue that was once Castiel doesn't move an inch, and doesn't answer.

"Keep staring at him! Don't blink!" The Doctor yells behind them.

Dean wipes the tears away frantically.

There is no easier thing in the world than staring at Cas anyway. So he stares.
