### Sam Winchester

Dean orders the biggest cheeseburger Josie's Burger has to offer and enjoys every bite slowly and contentedly, knowing Cas is watching his every move. He licks his fingers when he's finished. They share half a plate of large fries, and give off the rest to the eager pigeons wandering around their table the whole time.

They stand in the Bethesda Plaza listening to the busker playing one song after another, until the man packs the guitar and leaves for the day. The place is crowded with people, from those who sit in strollers to those in wheelchairs.

They watch ducks swimming under the bridge, and listen to the music playing on the Delacorte Clock and the little bronze animals dancing around the bell.

There is a brief rain when the sun is setting, and they do not rush their steps.

When they leave Central Park, it's still not dark yet.

They sit back in the parked car. Dean leans back in the driver seat, resting his eyes, with a smile hanging on his lips. "It's the best day in my life," he announces.

Cas watches him closely, "You're happy."

Dean opens his eyes, lazy. "First time in a long time," he agrees.

"Is that why you still haven't called Sam?" Cas asks carefully. "Or started driving to Texas?"

Dean stiffens a little, slowly sitting straight in the seat. "It's a thirty-hour drive," he says instead.

"I know," Cas nods with understanding. "Take your time."

Dean swallows. They both know it has nothing to do with the driving hour.

Cas reaches out to hold his hand, and Dean returns an appreciative nod.

It takes him three more days to start heading southwest, and another four days on the road. He does take his time.

<br>

The white-fence house appears down the street, and Dean already starts slowing the car.

"It will be okay," Cas says gently on the passenger seat.

Dean pulls over to the house slowly.

It's a woman opening the door. He hears Sam's voice from one of the rooms inside, "Who's it, Amelia?"

Amelia glances at them, answering, "He said he's your brother, with this other man."

Sam rushes out without his shoes. "Oh God," he breathes heavily, and while Dean's still wondering what to say, he's dragged into a bear hug. Cas receives one, too.

They get invited into the house, instead of getting kicked out.

He glances around.

The place is neat, without many items. Unlike the childhood house in his memory, Dean thinks.

Not very lived-in yet.

"You, umm, just moving in?" Dean prompts, scratching his nose, glancing at Cas quickly.

"A few months now, actually." Sam huffs a short laugh, following his gaze, a little self-consciously.

That's how they start sharing the stories. Dean manages to keep the Purgatory part short, and Cas amends a few details about situations in Heaven.

Sam listens attentively, and frowns when Dean starts talking about the cases in Manhattan.

"When was that?" Sam asks.

"About two weeks ago," Dean answers.

Sam takes a quick breath in. "How long have you been back, Dean?"

The Deja Vu of asking the same question when he found out Sam didn't spend a whole year in the Cage while he was living with Lisa rushes back to his head.

Dean blinks. "Three weeks. Cas's back for two weeks, give or take."

"Why didn't you call me?" Sam frowns deeper.

"You got out." Dean nods at their surroundings. And the woman who's now pointedly keeping herself busy outside the door in the small yard. "Last time you got out, you lived with a girl you'd like to marry, and I'm the one pulled you back in. I figure, better not to make the same mistake twice."

Sam is quiet for a long time, then, "Last time I wanted out, I knew you were out there somewhere and I could always call you. This time, for the first time in my life, I have no one. I thought you were dead, Cas too. Dad was gone, Bobby was gone. I don't have anyone." He sniffs slightly. "I'm not really choosing anything, I'm just running away."

Dean bites his lips, watching his little brother sniffing as if he's just an eight-year-old who can't find his way home -- in a way, there is truth in it. He rises up from the stool and wraps his arms around him. Sam leans into him like he used to when he was a child.

It feels good.

"It's okay now, Sammy," he pats his back. "We're home now."

"I'll let Amelia know." Sam is ready to head out. Dean stops him.

"You don't have to," he offers. "You get a nice place, a nice girl. You don't have to give it up, if you don't want to, choosing the 'monster life' over the 'normal life'. In fact, some new friends of ours just made that choice."

"What about you?" Sam asks.

"What about me?"

"You're still hunting. You're choosing the 'monster life'?"

"About that --" Dean glances at Cas again, starts grinning. "Let's say I'm living my 'normal life' on the way."

Sam's eyes x-ray between them. Dean ducks his head sheepishly.

"Oh --" Sam breathes.

"Yeah," Dean answers quickly.

"Congratulations?" Sam chances.

Dean grins wider.

They stay for dinner that day, and don't leave until it's late.

"You can stay in the guest room," Sam offers.

"You can stay in the motel," Dean retorts.

Sam rolls his eyes. "You didn't change a bit."

Dean laughs. "I know."

He pulls his brother in for another farewell hug.

"Text me when you have a case," Sam says. "I might join."

"Text me when you have a barbecue party or something," Dean replies, parroting his sentence. "Wouldn't want to miss."

"Or wedding, or baby shower." Cas supplies beside him.

"Or that," Dean nods, arms around Cas's shoulder.

"Take care of him," Sam looks at both of them. Genuine happiness in his eyes.

"Always," Dean answers reflexively.

"I'm talking to Cas," Sam says, chuckling.

"Of course," Cas answers solemnly.

They leave the place quietly.

Dean hums his favorite song when he's driving.

"You're happy," Cas notes again.

"Best day in my life," Dean answers.

"Better than that day in Manhattan?"

"Both on my top five list, let's say."

<br>

### Brian Williams

Brian almost drops the watering can when the bell rings. It's his son's house; no one knows he's here.

He hurries to the door, and joy overwhelms him to see Amy and Rory stand right there.

Rory gives him a hug and tells him he misses him, and Amy kisses his cheek as a greeting.

It doesn't happen often, and he thinks he knows exactly why.

The Doctor follows a few steps behind.

"May I?" He asks, as if he's not sure if he's invited to this house. Brian invites him in, and the Doctor grins joyfully.

For the whole day, they hang out in the house, having fun, telling jokes, watching TV. The Doctor hangs out with them, like a big teddy bear. Brian watches them from their back, still can't stop his thoughts wandering around, wondering where they just came back from. Is that ten thousand years ago, or ten thousand years into the future? How close are they, this time, to not coming back?

But he can't ask any of them, when he watches their faces. They're happy now, they're enjoying each other's company, and they're home, and he can see them. That should be enough.

His heart still pains at the thought.

They have a lovely, cheerful dinner.

And the next day, they are still at home.

"So, when are you heading out for your next adventure?" Brian asks them, a few days later, over dinner.

The chattering stops. The smiles stay still on their faces. Forced to be there.

Brian sees Amy and Rory exchange looks, and then with the Doctor.

"Dad?" Rory prompts.

"I understand you can't give up the 'Doctor Life,'" Brian says earnestly. "And I understand the risk. We talked about this, you don't have to give those up just to keep me company, and you certainly shouldn't give him up." He nods at the Doctor, sitting between Amy and Rory like a twelve-year-old. "You'd go with him, go save every world you can find, go live the life and try everything the world and life has to offer. The other life, the 'normal life' will still be here."

"Dad." Rory exchanges a look with Amy again. Amy nods at him, encouraging him to continue. "We decided to stay."

"Something happened on the last trip, didn't it?" Brian asks acutely.

"You can say that," Rory admits.

"What happened?" Brian frowns, sensing the atmosphere shifting to the heavy side. "Monsters never scare you off. Not even the end of the world. Not even death."

"But never seeing you again does," Rory answers.

They tell him the last trip, the angels taking Manhattan, the two other brave adventurers they met in the journey, the sacrifices they made for each other, the love that created the paradox and broke the spell, saved the world, saved everyone.

"If they weren't there, I think I'd be the one..." Rory can't finish the sentence, not when his father and his wife look at him like that, with those eyes so pained, so sorrowful. It's like just saying the sentence, saying the word out loud could kill them, or break their hearts.

Brian swallows. Amy grasps his hand.

"They saved us, Dad. So now, I think this is our second chance." Rory looks at Brian. "And we use this chance to come back home."

Brian doesn't know if he should feel happy or sad. Maybe both.

He wipes his eyes, finding them wet.

"Home," he repeats, nodding, murmuring, can't think of anything else to say.

It feels really nice, so selfishly nice to know they are going to stay now.

Stay at home.

Stay safe.

For however long they decide.

Until the next time they leave.

For as long as they want, and as long as they can have.

Brian remembers he forgot to finish watering the plants.

<br>

### Christmas

The doorbell rings. They are too busy around the kitchen and almost miss the sound.

"I'll go!" Amy wipes her hands and goes to open the door.

The first thing running into her eyes is a tall, red fez. The second thing is the Doctor under it.

"Hello," the Doctor waves tentatively. "Thought to drop by to say hi. I'll be on my way if you're busy."

"It's Christmas!" Amy says loudly.

"Oh, is it?" The Doctor glances around, and sees the Christmas decorations on the doorframe and in the yard of every single house in the block. "Sorry, didn't notice."

"And it's been two years! No postcard, no phone call, we worried!" Amy snaps.

The Doctor ducks his head, unsure of himself. "Sorry, the clock must be off, Tardis's fault. I was aiming for the year before, actually. It arrives late, it always does that."

Amy bursts into laughter. "It's a joke, you silly!"

The Doctor laughs nervously with her. "Ah!"

Amy steps aside to let him in. "Come on! The dinner's ready. You joining?"

"If it's not too much trouble," the Doctor answers sheepishly.

"There's a seat set for you," Amy tells him.

The Doctor is properly surprised. "How? You didn't know I was coming."

Amy says easily, "Because we always do, you moron."

<br>

This is the first time the Doctor realizes, he had so many friends before, he had partners, he had companions -- but this, this is the first time he has a *family*.

<br>

### Amy Pond and Charlie Bradbury

It's a pure coincidence, and a big surprise -- a good surprise.

Dean doesn't usually sit in the waiting seat outside the women's changing room -- he doesn't usually have a lady friend who'd drag him to the department and ask for *his* opinion.

But Charlie Bradbury doesn't fall into the "usual" category.

And they're preparing for a case. So it's technically counting as working.

Dean checks his watch. Charlie has been in there for a million years with about two million pieces of clothes.

He never knows waiting for others to change could be so testing on his patience.

That's when he hears a voice calling "Dean?"

He turns to see the man buried under a small mountain of bags and dresses.

"Rory." Dean recognizes him. "What are you doing here?"

"Amy is buying new clothes," Rory can't vacate his hands, so he nods at the lady's changing room. "Holiday shopping."

"Right," Dean says. He doesn't realize it's the holiday season at all.

"You?" Rory asks, moving closer to him slowly, and leaving the bags on the seat, panting slightly.

"With a friend, Charlie, also buying some clothes," Dean answers.

They start chatting, about the past few years, about where they've been, what they're busy with. Time passes easily.

Charlie and Amy emerge from the changing room, chatting heatedly and hugging as they walk toward them.

Dean raises a questioning eyebrow.

Charlie laughs, introducing them, "Amy, this is my friend Dean. Dean, Amy."

"I didn't know you were here!" Amy rushes to hug Dean, while Rory is waving slightly awkwardly at Charlie, telling her, "I'm Rory."

"I didn't know you two knew each other." Charlie eyes Dean and Amy curiously.

"She's that red-haired friend I told you about, if you still remember," Dean tells Amy. "I told you you'd like her."

"I really do," Amy grins at Charlie, touching her hand fondly.

"You introducing me to all your cool lady friends?" Charlie glances at Dean.

Dean chuckles. "Pretty much."

"Awesome," Charlie beams.

<br>

### The Doctor and Castiel

The universe is vast. And the timeline for eternity is long.

When they say they might see each other again, neither the Doctor nor Castiel really knows when or if it's going to happen.

But they both have long lives. In thousands of years, if fate leads them, they'll meet.

And they really do, more than once.

They meet when the stars are creating. That's the beginning of the time, but neither of them travels chronologically.

The Doctor has changed his face, and Castiel isn't exactly himself at that time.

The Doctor recognizes him first. The angel only blinks confusedly.

"I didn't expect anyone would be here," Castiel says, voice young, wings fresh.

"You don't remember me?" The Doctor asks. The angel shakes his head. But he's willing to know a new friend, a friend that is from a different planet than Earth, a different galaxy than the Milky Way.

And the new friend knows so much about Time and Space, almost as much as his brothers and sisters. But none of his brothers and sisters would be so patient, so curious, so polite to talk to him. He's barely a cherub anyway.

That is also what the Doctor realizes. This is way before Castiel meets him in New York. Eons before.

<br>

They meet again when the stars are dying, and when the timeline is crashing.

Eternity also has an end, just like the edge of the universe. Where everything is in ruin, and almost every life comes to an end. They run into each other again.

They watch the stars burning out in comfortable but unspeakable sadness. They both feel it.

"How's your human friend?" The Doctor asks him.

"His soul is still living in Heaven," Castiel tells him. "In a different plane. I'm glad they won't be affected by this."

The Doctor hums quietly. "Will you miss it? This physical, material dimension?"

"Of course," Castiel answers. "This is the dimension where the humans are born and live, where I meet some of the most brilliant ones, where I meet you, old friend. I will always remember it, long after it stops existing."

"Me, too, old friend. Me, too," says the Doctor.

Both of them are as old as the universe itself now.

<br>

### Castiel and The Statue of Liberty

They have talked about going back to Manhattan sometime, but for one reason or another, they never did.

"It's too crowded at this time of the year", "It's too hot or too cold now", "It's the rainy season"...

They just never go back, until one day, they have a good enough reason.

Sam's young son, the little Dean, sees the Statue of Liberty on the TV, and ever since, that has become the only thing he ever wants.

"Didn't you and Cas have a really good time in Manhattan?" Sam calls him.

Dean wouldn't forget it for a thousand years. "Yeah, it's like forever ago," he recalls. What he's really thinking is -- yeah, that was the time and place when they got together.

"Want to visit again?" Sam prompts. "My kid could use a tour guide."

"You could just say you want to have fun yourself, Sammy." Dean laughs.

"Is that a Yes?" Sam ignores him.

"Sure, why not?" Dean agrees.

<br>

But they are not really the best tour guides. Nor are they the best uncles, according to Sam -- but as long as there are small sweet treats and gifts, little Dean doesn't complain about his two uncles.

Dean and Cas wander off on their own when they are at the foot of the Statue of Liberty.

Dean senses Cas stiffens when he looks up at the statue. The official tour guide is going through its history, the year it was built, then gifted and transported. All very scholastic. Dean's attention comes to Cas.

Cas's jaw is set tight. He stares at the Statue of Liberty with fear in his eyes.

For years, Dean hasn't seen Cas afraid of something, let alone shaking with fear.

He quietly takes Cas away from the crowd and the long waiting lines, leaning on a clean wall in a small corner. The statue is out of sight.

Cas breathes heavily. Dean holds his arm, watching worriedly.

"What is it, Cas?" He asks, more worried than he has been for years.

It can't be that accident in Manhattan with the Weeping Angels or Purgatory infection coming back, biting their ass again, can it?

Cas closes his eyes for a short while, steadying his breath. "Nothing," he says, about to head out.

Dean grabs his arm. "It doesn't look like nothing to me. Is there something wrong with the Liberty? The Weeping Angels are back? The Lady Liberty is going to tear the city apart when no one's watching? What is it?"

"No, nothing like that," Cas says hurriedly. "Nothing wrong with the statue. No Weeping Angels." He bites his lips.

Dean studies his face. "Something with you then," he concludes.

Cas sighs. "It reminds me of Naomi," he admits under Dean's scanning eyes. "They have the same face."

"Thought she's gone ages ago, in that explosion we pulled." Dean grits his teeth.

"Yes," Cas says. "Yes, she did."

And Dean hears what he doesn't say -- It doesn't matter that she's gone. The fear is still there. Just a glimpse of her face, Cas would be immobilized by the fear from memory alone. He doesn't want to think about what horrifying things she'd done to him. Killing her seemed to be too easy for her.

Dean pulls Cas close, leaning in, letting him rest on his shoulder. He knows it calms Cas; it works as a charm. And this time is no exception.

Resting his chin on Dean's shoulder, Cas tells him quietly, "I can still see her. And all the other angels we lost that day. Inias, Hannah, Samandriel... We saved the world, but we couldn't save any of them. I mourn their loss every day."

Dean smoothes his back in small circles, rubbing his shoulder blades, soothing him gently. "They're infected. They could have been killed in Purgatory. We did what had to be done. We did our best." *I did my best, for you,* Dean thinks.

"I know," Cas says, "but it's not making things any easier." *And the most difficult part is, I can still see you falling from that building, every breathing moment. Coming to Manhattan, seeing the Statue of Liberty, just reminds me again how much pain it is to lose you. It's suffocating, intolerable, too painful.*

"I'm here," Dean hears his unsaid words. "Does it make you feel better?"

"Yes, so much." Cas nods, closing his eyes, feeling the warmth of their embrace. Dean breathes him in as well.

They leave Sam a message, and leave the island not long after.

They can enjoy the rest of the trip elsewhere.

It's going to be a long time until they come back to Manhattan.

<br>

(**Words after chapter**: The parts with Brian Williams and the Doctor visiting the Ponds on Christmas are both inspired and heavily tied to the official short videos released by Doctor Who canon. They're too beautiful, too touching, too heartfelt, I couldn't *not* write them. Even just to rewrite the same scene, I'd cry still.)
