The car screeches to a halt outside the building.

They scramble out, scanning the building and the surroundings quickly. The red neon sign with its name hanging from the rooftop.

There are no statues in sight. The two bases outside the door are empty. The gate is wide open.

They rush up the steps together.

"Why would they send them here?" River asks. "Why not back in time, like they normally do?"

"The babies might not be strong enough," the Doctor guesses.

"What is this place?" Amy asks, following the rest.

"Let's find out," Cas marches in.

The lobby is dark and dusty, but the dust on the floor has been disturbed recently, leaving visible signs of footmarks and a fight.

Cas glances at the empty stairwell, pressing the button. The rest of them scan around the space that is over quiet, over dead.

"I don't like it," Amy whispers.

"I don't think anyone ever does," River replies.

The elevator clinks to life, descending to their level, the echo sounding too loud for the space, loud enough as if it can stir awake ghosts living here -- that's what this whole place feels like, a building for ghosts, for the dead. Cas thinks, shifting uneasily.

They run into the elevator the minute it opens the barred door, and let it take them wherever fate decides to bring them.

"They're close," River reports, looking at her device.

A voice pierces through his head, as if speaking directly inside his brain. Cas presses his temple, focusing on the sound.

"Cas --" Dean's voice says rapidly through the prayer. "They're here, the angels. The Weeping Angels *are* the actual angels. I saw Tessa, Inias, and Hannah. I think every statue *is* a real angel, the ones went to Purgatory to get you and got wounded, must be Leviathan infection or some mutation. Be careful!"

"What is it?" Amy looks at him.

The elevator rings as it ascends, until it comes to a stop.

"It's a prayer," Cas doesn't have enough time to explain the whole thing, so he wishes they'd just understand. "Dean's praying to me."

The level they stopped at has a long, dimly-lit corridor lying before them, with numerous rooms placed on either side, just like all the other levels they have glimpsed on their way up.

Cas runs down the corridor first.

"Rory!" Amy follows him closely.

"Dean!" Cas yells his name.

The doors all have number plates and names labelled, alphabetically arranged. The first room starts with the last name "Wallace." That's a "W", so does "Williams" and "Winchester."

"Oh, that's bad," River says loudly.

Amy corners into an apartment first, throwing herself into the arms of the man behind the opened door. "Rory!"

Cas notices the room next to them also has an opened door. He rushes in without thinking.

Dean stands in the narrow hallway of the cramped room, looking unsure of himself.

"Dean!" Cas lets out a sharp breath, dragging the hunter into his arms. "I thought I lost you."

Dean pats his back with a relieved smile of his own, "That's a record. I was just praying to you."

"I heard," Cas tells him. "We're already coming to you."

"That elevator is you!" Dean realizes. "Almost gave me a heart attack, thought it was the angels. Did you see them?"

"Not on my way here," Cas says.

Outside, River notices the angel in the alcove, already moving halfway down the corridor. "Doctor, look!"

The angel freezes in their stare, but her hands are lowered from her face, pointing at the opened doors beside them. On her face, a simple, unsettling smile hung on her lips.

"Why is it smiling?" River asks with a shaky voice.

The Doctor follows the direction she points at; only then does he see the names on them. He lunges into Rory's room, grabbing Amy and Rory's shoulders. "Amy, Rory!" he yells, "Get out of there! Don't look at anything! Don't touch anything!"

That's when Amy stares over Rory's shoulder at the single, small bed in the room, asking, "Who's that?"

Next door, Cas is looking at a same cramped, shabby bed, with an old man lying under the cover, who reaches a trembling, withered hand toward him, pleading, "Cas --"

<br>

Cas lets go of Dean, moves to the bed slowly.

The man looks at him without blinking, as if afraid he'd disappear if he does.

"Cas..." he says again from a voice not used in decades, sore and croaked. His hands shake hard, wrinkles and pigment covering his arm. He lowers it to the bed in mere seconds like he doesn't have enough strength to keep them in the air, but still reaches in Cas's direction.

His eyes are foggy with a white layer from old age. The man must be in his nineties. Cas stares at his face, searching his eyes. Dean stands behind him, at the tail of the bed.

Cas lowers himself to the bed. That ancient face is still familiar, still recognizable, still unforgettable. "Dean," he breathes out difficultly, as if for his whole long life, for all the millionth time he calls the man's name, this is the most difficult time he's ever had.

He glances back, at the young Dean behind him, a look of unsure. "He's you," Cas says.

"Cas, please..." the old Dean moans weakly, fingers twitching, but still as if trying desperately to reach Cas, to touch him.

Cas wraps his withered fingers in his hands, holding him.

"Dean, what happened?" Cas asks the old man, voice tight. He swallows hard. He wants to glance back at the young Dean again, to know he's still there, the one he's more familiar with, but he also knows at this moment, he can't look away, he just can't. The old man lying on the bed, so desperately sad, so terribly old, breathing with a loud noise in his chest, with eyes so old and tired to open but still trying desperately to look at him, to hold him, that's also his Dean, the very same Dean. Cas gives him his full attention.

The old Dean pulls an exhausted tiniest smile, and he whispers, "It's... so good... to see you again, Cas."

His fingers slip from Cas's hold, and the lights die in his eyes. His body slumps back into the bed, not moving again.

Cas blinks hard, still holding the hands that are getting stiffer and colder fast. He breathes sharply, reaching out to close his eyes for him. He finds his hands shaking.

"Cas?" The young Dean moves closer to him carefully, putting a hand on his shoulder. Cas reaches to cover his hand with his own, finding himself lacking the courage to look back.

"What's happening?" Dean asks, utterly confused, looking from Cas to the old man on the bed.

Cas swallows hard, then tells him with a deep mourning voice, "I'm sorry, Dean. But you just died."

Next door, they hear Rory's panicking, high-pitched voice, "Will someone please tell me what is going on?"

And the Doctor answers him, painfully, regretfully. "You just died, Rory. I'm so sorry."
