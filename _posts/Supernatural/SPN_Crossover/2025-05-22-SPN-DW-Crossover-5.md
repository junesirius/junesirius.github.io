It's not the first time Dean gets flied around in a wing-trip, but this is certainly the top five most unpleasant journeys. He doesn't remember the other times being so rocky and nauseous. Even worse than the crash landing in the Tardis, the very same afternoon earlier.

The color and lights are muffled into a big kaleidoscope around him, spinning at a speed higher than his eyes and brain can possibly process. He really should have closed his eyes.

When his feet touch the ground in the rattled sound of wings fluttering, Dean stumbles to the ground on all fours, vomiting his breakfast burger and fries out.

"Cas, that's hell of a fly." He wipes his mouth, looking around.

The night is dark. The road has wet puddles from recent rain. The oil lamps by the road dimly light the street, showing vintage cars parked in front of a glamorous mansion, statues standing across the street from it. The air smells of damp cigar smoke and classy perfume, covering a lingering smell of horse. The sense of the thirties is permeating the air.

The Doctor and Amy are scrambling up from the ground just like him, recovering from an inelegant landing. The Doctor points his sonic screwdriver in all directions, making that small buzzing sound again, looks like trying to get a reading on the thin air.

"Where is Cas?" Dean sweeps around their landing point, then notices a small movement on the side of a parked car. He catches a glimpse of tan color and rushes there.

Cas slumps against the side of the car, eyes closed, panting heavily. His face is pale, his chest heaving and falling. Scratches of cuttings and bleeding marks all over his bare skin and clothes, more bloody wounds under the torn shirt and pants, misty light faintly glimmering in a few of the deep cuts. A smear of blood at the corner of his mouth.

Dean is instantly reminded of the last time Cas was severely weakened by a flight he had to lie down for a whole week; that other time to the Wild West wasn't easy, either. He kicks himself mentally for forgetting how much it always seems to exhaust him.

He shakes Cas on the shoulder gently, trying not to let the worry leak everywhere in his voice, "Hey man, how you holding up?"

Cas opens his eyes with a moan, eyes dazed for a moment before focusing on Dean's face. "Been better," he says, wiping his mouth, only to smudge the blood stain worse.

"Is it Naomi?" Dean asks, using his own cuff to help Cas clean up.

Cas shakes his head slightly. "It's the time flux itself. It's so... chaotic." He looks for a word to describe, then lands on -- "Scrambled. Too many Weeping Angels, we are not safe." Just like the Doctor guessed before.

Amy comes over too. "How's he doing?"

The Doctor says behind them, before Dean can answer, "Imagine when Tardis crashed, it's like trying to land a plane in a blizzard, and now? He's like a bird going through that same storm, no helmet, no seatbelt, and carrying three passengers!" His voice sounds impressed. "Welcome to 1938."

"And he did it," Amy murmurs quietly, kneeling down next to Cas, looking at his face closely. "You did it, you brought us all here. Thank you!" She says it wholeheartedly, then turns to Dean, "He'll be okay, right?"

"He's tough," Dean says, waving a hand at her, "Why don't you and Doctor go ahead looking for your man? I'll help him catch a breath first. He'd need enough strength for the trip home."

Amy nods appreciatedly, moving to check with the Doctor.

Cas's eyes follow their movement.

"Can you heal?" Dean asks with concern.

Cas frowns at himself with concentration, the way he would focus whenever he puts a finger on Dean's forehead and heals him. Dean watches his open wounds closely. They are not healed.

Cas shakes his head frustratedly. "I'm interfered," he says glumly, "Whatever is happening in the city, it's affecting my power, too. I can try harder but it might exhaust me more than healing me."

Only the slow, natural healing then. Like a human. Dean watches him, worried.

Cas holds an arm on the wet ground, making an effort to stand up. Dean reaches for his other arm, helping him to his feet.

Cas wobbles a little, but he manages to stand straight.

Dean smoothens out his trench coat and fixes his tie. The tears and cuttings don't look half as bad this way.

"It's too dangerous out here," Cas's voice croaks, tone warning. "They can be anywhere, any statues." He nods at the other side of the street, Dean follows his sight, noticing the two statues standing in the light lit from the mansion, the statues of a mother and a son. The remnants of the rain dripping on their faces, it's almost like their eyes are gleaming, staring intensely at the house.

"He's right, too much temporal disturbance, I can't get a good reading," the Doctor says, swinging the sonic screwdriver a few times like trying vainly to fix a used-up ink pen. "If the Angels are in this city, we're sitting ducks out here. Let's go inside first."

"You good to walk, man?" Dean asks under his breath, still holding Cas up like supporting an old man to cross the street.

Cas answers him, "I'm not fragile, Dean."

Dean doesn't move his hands away until they reach the building.

<br>

The giant, beautiful, classic-looking architecture in front of them is the biggest, most likely the richest house they can see around the place, and best of all, the brightest, with the most light -- where they can for sure see the Weeping Angels coming if they dare try.

Amy knocks at the door.

It takes long minutes for the guards to open at least half a dozen locks behind the door by the sound of them, and it's pushed open with only enough of a slit to show the guards' eyes. "Mr. Grayle does not expect more guests tonight."

"Tell him we are with the guests he already had," the Doctor answers smoothly.

The guards mutter quietly between themselves, probably waiting for a confirmation from a higher authority.

They wait impatiently for a few minutes, and Dean can't help himself. "Oh come on, it's taking too freaking long."

He moves to the door, pulling out his badge, "FBI inspection, open the door."

The guards back away from behind the door hesitantly, open it wider for them to enter, and relock each one of them quickly.

"Mr. Grayle is on the second floor with the Detective," the guards inform them.

They don't really need the guide to know where to find the owner of the place. The study on the second floor is dazzlingly bright, as if the man has spent half his fortune on collecting all the brightest light sources in the world to put together, keeping the place as bright as daytime. Massive chandeliers hang on the ceiling, wall sconces lining together with the oil paintings, spotlights shining with a great variety of ancient chinaware, and lamps and bulbs practically taking over every corner of the room.

They follow the ancient spiral stairs to the second floor and march into the study. A fleshy, boastful-looking man in a fancy suit stands in front of the desk, with an arresting woman near a corner alcove by the wall.

Dean walks into the room, flashing his FBI badge at the people in the room, announcing, "I'm Agent Plant. This is my partner, Agent Page."

He turns his head slightly at Cas, giving him a meaningful glance. Cas pulls out his badge like Dean did with a straight face -- the badge is displayed upside down.

Dean lets out a quiet sigh, correcting it for him. Cas murmurs, "Is it really necessary, Dean?"

And Dean looks down at his own badge, putting it away with another sigh. "Not really," he says, resigned, "'cause I read from the book they already knew it's fake."

The woman looks at them with a small, amused mockery, "That certainly looks fake to me."

Her eyes shift quickly toward the Doctor and Amy behind them, the grin turning into a wild smile, "Hello, Sweetie." Her eyes sparkle with joy at the reunion. "Took you long enough."

The Doctor tilts his head slightly, meeting her with a similar smile. "Sorry, didn't know you're here too, hon -- traffic was hell."

"How did you get here then?" The woman raises her left arm, showing a dark colored device on her wrist. While her right wrist -- Dean only notices now, after getting used to the lighting in the room -- is grasped tight by a Weeping Angel statue locked to the alcove wall. The statue looks more feral than the Angel of Water or any of the cherubs; it doesn't hide its face with palms, so all the fangs and wild fierce look is written clearly in each line and crack on its face. The stone on the statue is cracked and eroded, the eye sockets sunken deep in the face. It looks angry -- furious, perhaps -- which might have something to do with the long heavy chains that tether it to the plinth and the wall.

"No way Tardis can land in time turbulence like this, not even I can do that. And I took the Vortex Manipulator. So how did you?" the woman asks curiously, not giving the Angel holding her a second look, as if she's not noticing the dangerous situation she's in.

"Got help from some new friends." The Doctor taps Dean and Cas on the shoulders lightly. Dean is a little surprised at the word choice he used, but he's not complaining.

"I see." The woman regards them, not hiding at all the way her eyes checking both of them out, scanning up and down. Not in an uncomfortable way. More curious than anything. And she's enchanting enough to have a free pass anywhere anyway.

Dean meets her eyes while hers linger on his face. Dean notices at the same time how attractive and sexy she looks, and for some reason, somewhat familiar. He tries to scratch the memory where he might know her from -- the tight leather jacket, the bright red lips, all cleavage and curves -- he gasps quietly with realization, nudges Cas, and whispers, "She's the one from the book."

"What book?" The woman watches him closely.

"Enough babbling," the rich man -- must be the so-called Mr. Grayle -- steps into the center of the room, demanding their attention. "What's going on? Who are you? Detective Malone, I demand answers!"

"Shush, grown-ups are talking." The woman shoots him a stern look with enough might, as if *she* were the owner of the place. The man gapes his mouth open unbelievably with no words coming out.

"*You* are Melody Malone?" Cas catches up too, realizing what Dean's telling him.

"And how did *you* know River is Melody?" Amy raises her question.

Cas answers River's question first, "I found your book in our motel, with Dean and my name in it."

He pulls the book out of his pocket and passes it over to Amy. The cover looks exactly like River.

"A book I haven't written yet. I see, a common problem with time travel." River glances at it, making a face. "I don't like the cover."

The Doctor stares at Cas. "And you didn't think to mention it earlier?"

Dean defends, "We didn't even know what that was."

"All the more reasons," River says calmly.

Amy opens the pages. "It has my name too," she tells them, "and Rory, and Doctor."

"I was wondering how you knew where to find me this time. I was *just* thinking about sending you a message," River says with a mild smile. "A kiss in time flux, or something you couldn't miss. Thought some future version of me already did something I haven't thought about."

The Doctor answers sheepishly, "Total coincidence this time, sorry, River. We were actually tracking Rory."

Grayle runs out of all his patience, raising his voice, "Okay, I've had enough of this nonsense. Guards! Get them out of here!"

"I wouldn't suggest that," the Doctor warns in a low voice.

The two hefty guards they met at the gate burst into the room, each having a gun in their hands, pointing menacingly at them.

Dean draws out his own gun, pointing at the taller one among the two. Cas steps closer to him, raising a palm in a defensive gesture. The Doctor steps in front of River and Amy, pointing at the guards with his sonic screwdriver like a weapon.

"Very West Side Story," Dean comments. "What now? You're outnumbered."

"Not if I let the Angels in." Grayle threatens with a vicious smile.

"Risk sending yourself back in time? You wouldn't dare." The Doctor reads his face.

"How would you know?" Grayle challenges.

"There are an awful lot of locks on the door downstairs. And the blinding light here." The Doctor points out, meeting the man's mousey eyes, his tone icy. "You're scared. Which is good. Scare is good, it means you know they're dangerous. Because they *are*, beyond your puny little head's understanding. They are dangerous, they are patient, and they are fast, faster than any of us. No one stands a chance when they attack."

Grayle opens his palms, gesturing arrogantly at the luxurious, ancient-looking decorations and collections displayed around them, then at the chained statue in the alcove that still grips River's wrist. "Except I'm a collector. And you know what, they make the perfect collection."

"A collector and the New York crime boss, how does that work?" River provokes.

"Isn't that the same thing?" Grayle's eyes gleam. "Now, Detective, where are we? Oh, right, my friends," he nods at the group, leaving his glance especially longer on the Doctor, "why don't you do as I say, or you watch *her* suffer."

He flips the light switch on the wall before they can say anything. River gasps in the sudden darkness. All the lights are turned back on a second later.

The chained angel statue has moved in that blink of darkness. It dragged River closer to its body, the grip on her wrist is so tight and powerful that her whole arm is twisted outward at an odd angle. The Angel's right arm raises high with all the long claw nails out -- it's on the rim of a striking pose, and there is no way to run. River grits her teeth, cursing loudly, "Damn you!"

"I hope you take it seriously now," Grayle smiles meaningfully at the rest of them. "One more flip, the Angel can snap her neck."

"What do you want?" The Doctor has burning fire in his eyes, his voice colder than a glacier.

"Those two, take them to the babies, like the other one." The man talks to the guards, gesturing to Dean and Amy.

Dean shifts his gun toward him. "Or I can just blast a hole in your chest," he spits.

"I assure you," Grayle says in his greasy voice. "I can flip the switch before you pull the trigger."

"Please, don't." The Doctor lowers his voice. Dean realizes he's talking to him. "And please take care of Amy, we'll come to you as soon as we can."

"Take me with them, then." The words surprise many of them, and it is Cas, stepping toward Grayle. "I'm no use to you here; let me go with them."

Grayle sizes him up with interest, glancing between him and Dean. "I do have some other plan for you," he says with a faintly amused smile.

"Cas --" Dean has lowered his weapon, letting himself be grabbed by the arms by the guard he was pointing his gun at earlier. The other man takes Amy, shoving her out.

Dean manages to turn his head and meet Cas's eyes even as he is on his way getting pushed out of the door. "Cas, I'll be fine. Don't do anything stupid."

He only gets time to see Cas's deeply worried eyes and creased furrows one more time, before he gets hustled downstairs, into the cellar -- more like a dungeon, to be precise.

The guards dump them both into the utterly dark space, the only light coming from the open door.

"The lights are out --" the tall one leers at them from the top of the stairs, "you'll last longer with those."

A box of matches is thrown into the place, landing on the floor next to Amy's feet.

"What do you care?" Dean asks furiously.

"It's funnier." He grins with teeth, shutting the door. There is the sound of bolts slamming.

The place is drowned in complete darkness.
