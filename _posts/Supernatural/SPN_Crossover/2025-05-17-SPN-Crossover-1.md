Rain pours down the city, soaking the buildings and the statues in gloomy coldness. The night is deep, but the city is still awake. Lights glittering in every window and lining the streets. A city that never sleeps.

Thunders roar from the distance, water streaming down the face of two statues standing across the street from a grand mansion. The statue of a woman holding the hand of a little boy. Light is extraordinarily bright in the building, seeping out from the windows to light up the stretches of the road in front of it like day time, shining on the faces of the statues. A man stands behind the window, gazing at the night street, biting his cigar.

The Detective hurries toward the glamorous building. The black umbrella barely has a chance against the storm. A carriage passes by on the street, water puddles splashing under the horse's hoofs.

The giant door opens slowly with numerous tedious clicks of locks unbuckling, opening to a slit merely wide enough for the Detective to pass through sideways. Eyes of two guards in fine suits and hats peer through the opening, glancing at the night outside warily. The door is closed tightly immediately after.

"Detective," the man turns from the window, holding a hand toward his new guest, "Julius Grayle." He greets with a pretentious nod.

"Honor." The Detective gives a short nod as reply, not taking his hand. "Every man and woman in New York knows your name, Mr. Grayle."

Grayle turns to the window, smoking his cigar. His reflection looks behind him on the bright window glass. "So are you, Detective, I heard you are the best investigator in Manhattan. So, will you take the case?"

"Sure. Why not?" The Detective smirks an amused smile.

"Because you don't believe me." The man waves a hand casually, not shifting his eyes. The mother and son statues are barely visibly in the downpour from across the street now. The night is even darker by each passing minute.

The guards read his gesture and bring forth a leather briefcase, opening it on the luxurious study desk. Fresh bills bundled neatly inside.

The Detective glances at the display, looking back at the reflection of the man. "For that as payment plus expenses? I'll believe any damn thing you say."

"But you don't believe that statues can move." Grayle finally takes his gaze away from the window, turning round, studying his guest's face.

The Detective says nothing.

"You're right, Detective. They can't. Of course they can't... " Grayle pauses a beat meaningfully, "... when you're looking."

The Detective just eyes him, then, "Whatever it is, I'm sure there is an explanation."

"I'm counting on that." Grayle grins a humorless smile. "Good night, Detective. And good luck." He nods at the guards and turns back to the window. His look is troubled now, frowning at the night street outside.

The Detective picks up the cash from the desk, puts on the hat and coat, and follows one of Grayle's men out.

Across the street, light leaking from the mansion shines on the place where the statues were. Rain pours down on the empty plinth, wetting the stone.

<br>

The address written on the back of the business card Grayle left on top of the briefcase is an apartment building several blocks away, near Battery Park. Statues stand crowdedly among the trees in the park and near the building, leaving shadows like living beings under the night sky. The red neon sign on top of the building reads "Winter Quay."

The Detective walks up the steps leading to the building's entrance, and pauses midway, glancing at the flanking statues on the two sides uneasily. They are big weeping angel sculptures, wings closed on the back, hands covering the faces, water streaming down their fingers like tears.

The rain is relentless, and the air is prickling, leaving the kind of feeling that one is watched silently for each step from behind.

The building is tall, steeping among Manhattan's forest of skyscrapers. Most of the windows are open on the tall floors regardless of the drencher, some of the lower levels' too.

The Detective glances at the windows, meeting the eyes of a young girl in blue dress. The girl stands alone by the window, wind flowing her dress and hair in all directions. She covers her face in her palms, closing her eyes, then suddenly looking out from behind her hands. Her lips mummer some words that The Detective cannot hear, a warning or just a playful "peek-a-boo" no one would ever know.

Next to her window, an old lady stares out. Her eyes are hollowed, lost focus, and so, so sad just by the look of them. Next to hers, is another aged men, the same tired, lifeless look. Then more of the same. All aged, all quiet, all defeated. The look of trapped and lost.

The Detective shifts the gaze uncomfortably, moving to walk up the remaining steps. The doors open automatically at the newcomer's approach, swinging slowly back on their own. The Detective hesitates at the threshold, eyeing the inside warily.

The street light shines into the hallway, showing a grand but deserted space. The metal sign by the empty elevator well is rusty, the letters noting the number of rooms on each floor are shallow and dusty, looking as aged as the residents peeping out from the windows.

The elevator well is old-styled, with hollow metal structure like a half-finished construction site. The Detective approaches it cautiously, one hand resting close to the back of the belt where the pistol is.

"Hello?" The Detective voices carefully, then almost startles at a sudden loud sound of clanking noise. The sound echoes in the empty space.

An ancient elevator wheezes its way down to the ground level, the metal door squeaks open.

Looking up, there is no showing who -- or what -- might have sent it down, The Detective steps in the cramped space hesitantly. The door rattles behind.

There is no button or handle to indicate which floor to go to. The elevator clanks into life, rising on its own accord.

The Detective turns around inside the elevator, startled again. The weeping angel statue that was outside the building, is now standing exactly where the human was moments ago, facing the elevator. Its face cupped in its hands, its wings spread open.

"What the hell?" The Detective gasps.

The lift rises beyond the first floor, blocking the view of the statue shortly.

<br>

The floor it stops at looks like a luxurious hotel floor, with crimson velvet carpet layering on the corridor. The lights on the ceiling flicker occasionally, as dim as candlelight. The long, bleak corridor is quiet, with doors and rooms on each side. A weeping angel statue sits at the end of the corridor inside an alcove, hands covering its face, head lowered in a humble, solemn pose.

The Detective steps down the corridor carefully, glancing at either side. Some doors are closed, some open. Behind each open door, there is an empty small room to live in. And on each closed one, there is a number and a name tag.

The Detective checks the names on the doors, slowly, one by one, until stops dead at one closed door -- with the familiar name of his own.

The unlocked door is easily pushed open. The Detective knocks on it as he enters, "Hello, anyone home?"

The small apartment room has a narrow, dusty doorway, as bleak and ancient as the rest of the building. But with a small hint of someone has been living here, probably alone, probably a very long time.

The cloth rack by the door has a hat and coat hanging on it. A tall, black gentleman hat, and a long suit coat, exactly like the ones The Detective is wearing, though much older. He touches his own coat self-consciously, moving down the doorway with more unease by each step.

Lying on the shelf next to the coat rack, a leather briefcase. Dusty and unused. Exactly the same as the one in his grasp right now.

The Detective frowns deeply, putting down the one he's holding on the floor, opening the one in front of him. He drops it in a gasp -- the neatly bundled cash lies inside, with a handwritten card reading "Winter Quay" in fading ink on the very top.

His heart pounds fast. He reaches for his own briefcase, almost ready to dash for the door, only to be stopped by a weak sound behind him. A voice that sounds like a moan or a whimper.

The door leads to a bedroom, cramped and bleak, with only a bed in the center and barely anything else.

The Detective can't help himself crossing into the room.

The old man lying in the bed must be in his nineties, his breath ancient and withered, like the last leaf on a winter tree.

"Who are you?" The Detective approaches the bed, curiosity and horror taking over the action.

The old man's eyes flicker open, staring at the his bedside visitor with dead fish's eyes, his voice croaked for lack of use: "Run! Run! They're coming for you! They'll send you back!"

"Who's coming? Back where?" The Detective is alarmed. The light in the room and in the corridor flickers harder. There is long stretch of dark moments between lights. A loud stomping sound pounds on the ground from far distance.

"In time! Back in time!" the old man struggles hard, rising his upper body to clutch on The Detective's arm, gasping urgently, "I'm you! *I'm you!!*"

Then his struggle stops abruptly. His movement falls still. He closes his eyes as the last strength is drawn out. A last breath is rattled from his throat, and then there is no more.

Freaked out, The Detective glares at the body in the bed, stumbles a few steps back, and flees toward the door.

He races out of the apartment as fast as he can, only to halt abruptly as he sees the weeping angel statue that was in the alcove has left its place. The hands are lowered, the face with hollow eye sockets facing him, one hand reaching out to him like an invitation, undoubtedly trying to touch.

The Detective rushes to the opposite way. The elevator sighs a stop, the doors clattering open, and inside the lift, the weeping angel that was outside the building stands straight, hands reaching out, mouth open, showing sharp, ugly fangs.

The Detective's mouth agape, "What the --"

He stirs around, only to find the one from the alcove has moved forward, standing still halfway down the corridor. Looks back to the elevator, the other statue is outside the lift now.

The Detective desperately turns around, looking for a way out. Only then does he notice the green emergency sign over his head marking "Exit" with an arrow pointing at the door behind him. And thank god, that door marks "Stairs."

He throws himself through it. The corridor light dies at the same moment.

The emergency light wakes in the stairwell, leaving weak green patches of light and shadows. The Detective lunges for the downward stairs, but shadows of two statues are already there, frozen as he stares at them. He glances upward then blinks down, those two shadows are already around the corner. The arms of the statues reaching out in an attacking pose.

The Detective races up the stairs without looking back.

<br>

He bounds up the stairs for his dear life, slamming the stairwell door the moment he reaches the rooftop, blocking it with some scattered iron bars he finds on the floor.

The rooftop is high above the ground, the light from top of Chrysler Building looks only a short distance away. This sleepless city has flowing lights in the skyline and on the street, but at this moment, to his horror, the whole city's light blinks. And in each brief moment of darkness, the loud crashing sound shakes the earth. The sound of something giant stomping on the ground, moving closer step by step.

WHOMP!

The city's light blinks.

WHOMP!

The building shakes.

WHOMP!

The sound comes from directly behind. The Detective turns around slowly.

The giant shadow of a massive statue falls on him. Its face over the far edge of the rooftop, its mouth wide open. A torch in her right hand.

The Detective gasps in horror and total disbelief: "You gotta be kiddin' me!"
