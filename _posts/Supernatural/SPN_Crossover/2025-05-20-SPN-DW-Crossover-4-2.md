Cas lets go of Dean's hand.

They look around.

The Doctor busies himself around a central structure that Dean's pretty sure is where all the engines and control units are -- if any of the sci-fi movies have any truth in them. A huge, bright pumping pillar with glass spheres vibrates up and down, making a loud whirring sound -- that's the sound they heard when the whole thing just materialized around them.

Dean watches the structure moving, walking slowly toward the console table and the guy running around it. "Do all your toys have to make funny noises?"

Amy can't hold back a small laughing sound from the other side of the table.

The Doctor rolls his eyes at Dean, offended, "This is Tardis! Of course she has to make this beautiful sound! What do you know about 'Time and Relative Dimension in Space'?"

Dean stutters, "Ugh, come again?"

The Doctor smirks, "Like I thought. If you don't know anything about her, don't make rude comments! She might be upset."

"She might be upset if you keep the brake on when landing. That's where the noise comes from." Cas follows Dean up the steps around the hexagon-shaped console table, pointing at a handle on its face. "Type Forty model's common problem."

The Doctor narrows his eyes at Cas a second time on the same day. He unleashes the handle to the opposite direction, and the noise quiets just like Cas said. "What are you?" The Doctor asks cautiously, "I don't think I've ever met your kind before."

"I'm an Angel of the Lord," Cas answers potently.

Dean adds, "He's with me." He squares his shoulders, feeling oddly proud.

The Doctor eyes both of them carefully, as if only now does he properly register them. "Relative to the Weeping Angels?" He asks, probing.

"I don't think so," Cas answers frankly. "I've only known them for the first time today."

"But you know a lot of things, you know about the Time Lords and Tardis," the Doctor purses his lips. "I don't like it."

Cas lowers his head a little, "That was unexpected knowledge to me as well, back when I was the God. Long story."

Amy whispers to Dean, "Don't mind him. He's just jealous, he doesn't like *not* being the smartest man in the room."

Dean grins, putting a hand on Cas's shoulder. "Alright, you two, enough peacock time. What are we all doing in here? Thanks for not leaving us behind, by the way, I wasn't sure about that."

The Doctor rolls his eyes again, "Of course I wouldn't do that, what do you take me for?"

Dean shrugs.

Amy answers on the Doctor's behalf, "You said the angels sent Rory back, and we think the cherubs don't have enough power to send him too far, so we might still have a chance to find him and save him -- good thing that Tardis is a time machine. So we only need to find out exactly when and where, and Doctor thinks he can trace back the temporal signal, but it takes some time to calculate."

She gestures to the console panel where the sonic screwdriver is plugged in, an old-time display screen on top of it showing some running patterns, presumably working like a computer.

Dean looks at the screen for a few moments, realizing he can't read a thing -- they're not even in English, the patterns with circles and lines are as beautiful as stars and planets but give no clue. He tilts his head and whispers to Cas, "It's like watching Sammy do the research, all the nerdy science stuff."

Cas hums softly, a fond smile showing at the mention.

Dean claps his hands, "Alright, what do we do while waiting then? You gonna give us a tour around the ship or what? Tell me you have booze here." He moves away from the console, curiously sneaking a peek at the spiral staircase on the other side of the room leading upward.

The Doctor snorts, "That is so American."

Dean rolls his eyes, "What, you drink tea instead?"

Amy cuts in, "You think it's a ship?"

Dean looks around the spherical space they're in -- which has a ton of round decorations on the curved walls and the ceiling as if they're inside a huge sphere at least three floors tall, he wonders if anyone on the Bethesda Terrace would have noticed this probably enormous alien-looking spaceship from outside, but he decides if their alien techniques are as advanced as the rest of it look like, they're probably invisible.

Dean nods at their surrounding to make a point and looks back at Amy, "A spaceship, yeah? What else can it be?"

Amy winks with a mysterious smile, "It's a time machine. It can go to all the time and all the places in the universe."

"A time-travel spaceship. A timceship!" Dean announces the newly invented nickname proudly.

The Tardis makes a low gnarling sound right then, among the constant wheezing.

"She doesn't like it, don't ever say that again!" The Doctor says without looking away from the view-screen.

"That can't be true. Wait, can she really hear me?" Dean turns to Cas in confusion. But even Cas has a mischief curve on the tip of his lips.

Dean glares at Cas unbelievably, "Not you too."

The curve widens slightly on Cas's lips, and he says, "Well, I speak all languages in the universe, including that of Tardis."

Dean finds it impossible to tell if he's serious or joking.

Amy pets the console desk like it's a delicate living thing, fingers stroking along the blinking buttons and sliders and connecting cables, says fondly, "She's a good girl, and she's *Tardis*. Don't think there is any word in the universe cooler than that."

Dean pretends a defeated sigh, turning back to Amy, "You remind me of someone. She's like a sister to me. Also red hair. I think you'd like her if you stick around longer. Now, drink?"

Amy smiles small, giving him an appreciative nod, stepping toward one of the roundels on the wall. She presses on some of them, as if looking for a correct password combination to open something. "Sorry, River, I think there's some stash somewhere --"

The Doctor looks up at her, confused, "What do you mean? There's nothing there --"

That's when a hidden cabinet opens, showing a secret stash of delicate bottles of liqueurs.

The Doctor is speechless for a second, then outrageous, "When did -- It's *my* Tardis! You can't just make random adjustments like that -- ahh, River!!"

Dean admires the collection, grinning, "Now we are talking." All the top-shelf fine collections, nothing he'd spot in places they'd usually go -- in fact, now that he thinks about that, given that they're on some alien's spaceship, these might not even be from Earth, and considering the time travel, they are most certainly not from current time, which means the drinks could have ages and ages to brew properly.

He pours himself a glass, appreciating the flavor, "Whoever this River dude is, he certainly has taste."

"*She* --" Amy emphasizes, "is my daughter."

Dean is taken aback a little, mentally measuring Amy's age, trying to do the math. "Is she even of the age?"

"And my wife." The Doctor adds weight to the bomb drop.

Dean stares at him, then looks back and forth between the Doctor and Amy. "Wait, that means you two are --"

"Mother-in-law, I know." Amy's face drops unhappily for some reason, "Time travel thing, it's a long story. Two thousand years long, actually, not sure I want to talk about it, especially when Rory is not here."

The Doctor's face glooms at the same moment, he starts randomly flipping a few switches up and down.

"Time travel is never easy, isn't it?" Cas suddenly comments. He's been watching them quietly for some time. "Always so many regrets in the past you'd want to change, but you just couldn't save everyone, and you can't change the fixed points even if you can travel back in time."

The Doctor gives him a deep look. "Indeed," he says with a low voice. The word is simple, but his tone is fractured.

Their eyes meet, both as aged as the length of the universe itself. There is a moment of understanding.

Dean watches them, suddenly realizes with more clarity than ever -- that Cas is old, really old, as old as the Earth and Sun and the beginning of all the Time and Universe. And here he is, standing in the room, wearing a trench coat, walking and talking. That Doctor has probably seen just as much time and universe to have eyes as sad and deep. He swallows. He's just a human.

Dean takes a gulp of the drink. The liqueur smooths down his throat, but it's still dry.

"You lost someone, didn't you?" he asks quietly. The question slips out of his tongue without permission.

The Doctor shoots him a pained look. "I'm hoping not anymore," he says simply, his eyes lingering on Amy's back for a moment too long.

The four of them fall quiet for a brief moment, only hearing the tiny tinkling sound from the Tardis. And then it beeps loudly, with a red flashing sign shining on the screen. The ceiling is rounded by a circle of red light shortly after.

They jump to their feet toward the console.

"That doesn't look good." Dean comments. Whatever it is, a red flashing thing is never a good thing.

The Doctor looks closely. Cas stands next to him, reading the same screen.

"What does it say?" Amy urges, "Did it find Rory?"

"April the third, 1938, old-town New York." Cas reads the message, frowning.

Dean claps his hands, "Good, we have the time and location, let's go. What are we waiting for?"

The Doctor unplugs the sonic screwdriver from the control panel, beaming its head toward the screen. The familiar metallic whirring sound echoes again, the floor bumping like an airplane in heavy turbulence. Then the red warning alarm screams louder, and the floor they're standing on starts shaking violently in all directions. The lighting inside the whole space blinks on and off as the floor wobbles, turning to a dark crimson red color. The color of blood and danger.

Amy and Dean have to grab the closest handrail to steady themselves. The Doctor and Cas lean on the console desk.

The Doctor yells over the loud emergency alarm. "She doesn't let us land! It's like a storm blizzard out there. Hang on!"

Cas puts both his hands on the metal handle he pointed out earlier -- the brake, apparently. The quaking eases for a few seconds, but almost immediately turns into a sideward spinning. All of them fall to the floor, swinging toward one side of the wall then the other; the handle is let loose, shifting up and down rapidly on its own.

The Doctor stretches his arm to reach for a hammer from underneath the console, striking the surface. "This usually works!" he shouts at the frantic central control unit, "Come on, you sexy thing! You can do it!"

"You are making it worse!" Cas yells back.

The console makes an extremely loud explosion sound, followed by a strong burning smell and dark smoke bursting from the fried panel. The brake handle flies to the ceiling and lands on the floor in two pieces.

The whirring sound slows down, but the spinning wall gets worse. They can do nothing but grasp whatever they hold on to for their dear lives.

Dean clutches the handrail with whitened knuckles, thinking how bad this idea is to board an alien ship. He doesn't even like to take airplanes, so why does he ever enter a time-travel spaceship that doesn't even have a seatbelt?

Amy falls not far from him, clinging to the same handrail as he does. In the first bout of spinning and crashing, Amy slipped right near his side. So Dean has enough distractions trying to give the lady a soft landing to not completely freak out.

And then the floor comes to rest. So are the vibrating spherical things in the center of the control pillar, which -- if a spaceship works the same way as a car -- probably means the engine has died when the brake blew off. The room is filled with smoke.

"Out! Out!!" The Doctor dashes to the door, pulling it wide, urging all of them out. In his hand, there is a fire extinguisher.

Dean and Amy rush out of the door. Cas follows closely after them. The Doctor yells at the control: "Extractor fans on!!" The loud noise of fans rumbles to life on his command.

"What the hell was that?" Dean demands, stumbling out, coughing violently because of the smoke, catching himself on the knees. Cas hurries toward him, whispering to ask if he's hurt, and Dean waves him off because he's fine.

"1938, we just bounced off it." The Doctor pokes his head out of a blue phone box, white foam and dark smoke flying in and out of the open door.

Dean straightens up when he finally catches his breath.

They are in the middle of a graveyard, with countless tombs and stones lying around them. Statues of angels and decorative figures stand at the border of the yard, in the stance of mourning and protecting. New York's modern skyscrapers can be seen over the horizon.

"Where are we?" Amy asks.

"Still in New York," the Doctor raises a finger in the air, feeling the wind, then puts the finger in his tongue, tasting the air. "Not-1938."

<br>

"You have a time machine, and it goes anywhere but 1938? How does that work?" Dean asks sharply.

"I don't know! Something is wrong with that time, I think probably too many Weeping Angels there, the time flux is all scrambled." The Doctor finishes with the fire extinguisher, changing to use his sonic screwdriver, beaming at the blue box the same way he pointed at the cherub statues earlier.

"And what's the deal with that blue box?" Dean peeks through the door, finding the inside is just the same spacious control room he was in moments ago. He walks around it, staring at the letters "Police Box" on top of the door. The inside is the time-traveling spaceship he fancied, but the outside just looks like a very English-looking police phone box from 50s, which can barely fit two grown men. Dean can't say he's not disappointed. "It's smaller on the outside."

The Doctor rolls his eyes. "That's a first, people usually say 'bigger on the inside'."

"Same thing," Dean mumbles.

"It's a disguise. I like it, I keep it, problem?" the Doctor cocks his head in challenge.

"Or it might be a malfunction in the Camouflage Unit and Cloaking Device. Have you considered replacing the chameleon circuit that has broken down?" Cas suggests kindly.

Dean wiggles his brows, "How about that?"

The Doctor stares them down. "Shut up," he says, turning back to the Tardis.

He fondles the charred paint on its exterior, his touch gentle and loving. He presses his forehead on the doorframe. Dean can hear him murmur quietly: "I'm so sorry, Dear. Take your time, rest up. We'll find another way."

Dean raises one eyebrow, amused.

Cas whispers in Dean's ear: "I think Tardis is like his Impala."

Dean turns to him sharply, "I'm not like that --"

Cas gives him a pointed look.

Dean stutters, his cheeks heated. "Shut up."

He turns to look at what the other two are doing now, wondering what to do next.

"What you said about the time flux," Dean asks slowly. "What's that? How do we fix it?"

Cas explains to him, "Time is fluid. I told you that before, that's why we can bend it on occasions."

"I didn't realize that means literally actual *fluid*." Dean feels like he's the slowest kid in the school and he doesn't like it. "Thought it's more of a metaphor, like, 'as time passes by like a river flowing' kind of thing."

"No, no, nothing like a river." The Doctor chimes in. "Humans can only understand things in such strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff."

Dean raises his eyebrows. "That is just so English," he cackles.

The Doctor disappears inside the blue box, and reappears with a clumsy, odd-looking, circuit-wrapped scavenger device that looks like it's built from a bunch of sixties household items and kitchen utensils. A little bigger than his palms.

They watch him pull out two antennas and wave the device around, reading some display on it that only he can understand.

"Doctor, what's that?" Amy asks.

"My timey-wimey detector," he concentrates on the reading, turning from one direction to another. "The Tardis navigation system is busted. I need something to tell me when and where we are. It goes 'ding' when it detects stuff."

"I made a better hand-made EMF than that when I was ten," Dean tells Cas in a low murmur.

"I made it three hundred years ago when I got trapped in 1969," the Doctor says loudly. Dean's not sure he heard his last comment. "by Weeping Angels too, that time. Not very fun."

"Sound like you got trapped by Angels a lot, Doctor," Amy remarks.

"They are nasty creatures," the Doctor wrinkles his nose like he smells something disgusting. "I hate things attacking you from your back when you are not looking." He says one word at a time, slowly, "I, hate, Angels."

Cas shifts uncomfortably by Dean's side.

Dean glances at him, talking in a low voice, "He doesn't mean you."

"I know," Cas answers. But still, his gaze drops to his feet.

The device in the Doctor's hand makes a "ding" sound.

"So, looks like we are still in 2012, back where we started," he tells them.

"A long way from 1938," Amy paces up and down the field in the graveyard, worry radiating into the air. "There must be a way to go there; we can't just leave Rory there. Doctor? Come on, come up with some brilliant ideas, like you usually do."

The Doctor runs a hand through his hair, mumbling, "I have two, but one of them requires a Vortex Manipulator, which I don't have, because I left it to River after the Pandorica, which leaves only one. But I really, really don't like it."

The three of them wait for him to spill out, but the Doctor hesitates.

Amy snaps, "What is it?"

The Doctor looks at her sheepishly, "We can let the Angels touch us and send us back."

"Would that work?" Amy asks, unafraid.

"I don't know. They might send us to different times; I might never find you or Rory again. That's what I'm afraid of," the Doctor says in a pained voice.

"But that's our only chance of finding Rory, right?" Amy glances around, already looking for the nearest Weeping Angel statue she can use.

"Amy --" the Doctor pleads quietly.

Cas chimes in suddenly, "There is another way."

"Cas, no --" Dean knows what's in his mind immediately, holding out a hand trying to stop Cas.

Cas steps toward Amy, "I can fly us there." Dean closes his eyes.

The Doctor studies him, "Why didn't you say so earlier?"

Dean answers for him, "Because it might kill him."

"It doesn't matter." Cas keeps his eyes on Amy, ignoring Dean's gaze on his back.

"'Course it does!" Dean snaps, "Cas, dammit! You said Naomi could find you and do whatever horrible things she has in mind for you!"

"Or maybe not. If we're quick enough, go there and back in a blink, she might never notice." Cas retorts, holding out a stubborn hand toward Amy. "I can help."

Amy glances between Cas and Dean, then smiles at Cas, "You really are an angel, aren't you?"

Cas smiles back, "I try to be."

Dean sighs loudly, standing closer to Cas. "I'll go too. One more person, should find him quicker."

The Doctor steps into the small circle they formed around Cas as well, following what the other two are doing, putting his palm on the hand Cas holds out.

He winks at the group, "Well then -- Geronimo!"
