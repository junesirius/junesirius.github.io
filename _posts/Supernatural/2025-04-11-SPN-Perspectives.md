Imagine your friend whom you used to hang out with together, eat in the diner, drink in the bar, chat and chill out, just have fun together for years or decades. You both lose count of how many bottles you guys have drunk together. Then one day he tells you, he falls in love with a particular bottle of wine, he loves it so much that he can't help himself kissing it, caressing it, taking it to bed. He licks the cap fondly, but doesn't drink it, even though you can tell he really, really wants to drink it, as much as you do, but he resists it. He gets furious when you suggest you guys should drink it. He fights you when you try to touch that bottle of wine, he fights so hard for that wine that he is willing to kill you in order to protect it from you. In the end, you call other drinking buddies to contain his madness. He refuses to give it up, wants to leave you guys forever, and live with it. So you guys ended up killing him and drinking that wine. Only that wine turns into a person just like you. -- That is a vampire falling in love with a human.

Imagine another of your friends whom you used to hang out with together, again, eat in the diner, drink in the bar, go to sport league and exercise a lot, also just chill and have fun for years. You both lose count of how many burgers you guys have eaten together. Then one day he tells you, he falls in love with one particular burger. He loves it, kisses it, caresses it, sleeps with it, wants to marry it. He licks it and resists really hard to not eat it. And he fights and is willing to kill you if you ever want to lay a hand on that burger. -- That is a werewolf falling in love with a human.

Now imagine, this third friend of yours, whom you used to hang out with together, go to school together, listen to classes and do homework as teachers instruct, and play in the yard after school. There are ants moving around in the yard, and you both would watch them sometimes, play with them, get curious about them, sometimes accidentally step on a few and kill them, sometimes purposefully mess with a few and cause them dead. Then one day, he tells you there is a particular ant he falls in love with. He forbids you to mess with it, touch it, step on it, and demands that you help it when it needs. He lowers himself to the ground so he is on the same ground level as the ant. He very carefully uses fingers to help the ant move around with food or whatever it needs. And when other school buddies hang out to watch the ants, and they think he loses his mind and wants to send him to an asylum, he stands in front of the ant to protect it, and kills those buddies and schoolmates. He stops going to school because he wants to stay in the yard with the ant all the time. When inevitably one day the ant is killed, he is in great grief and looks for all the ways possible to bring it back to life, and he succeeds, despite causing terrifying consequences to the whole yard and whole school. And when the ant is going to die again because his father is fed up with his attention and dedication and the amount of time he spent on that ant, his father wants to clean the whole yard, he willingly gets himself killed to protect the ant, to create a chance for the ant to kill his father. And the ant succeeds. -- That is an angel falling in love with a human.
