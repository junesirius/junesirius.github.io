Very random thought, if Castiel Fitzgerald (Garth's son) and Dean Winchester II (Sam's son), end up together, what should their ship name be? destiel 2.0? little baby destiel? werewolf destiel?

Funny how it's nonhuman Cas x hunter Dean again, with a little bit of age difference and Cas being the older one. Coincidence?

can already hear them having some typical little frustrating argument:

> Cas: "Dean! I'm a monster! I'm literally a werewolf!" *And Dean's a hunter, they can never be together.* He thinks.
>
> **Dean: "I don't care! Werewolf or not, I want you! I love you!" (Sam taught him well, and he has a loving mother, so he's not emotionally constipated, and he doesn't have to save his love until dying or grief moment.)

(Castiel Fitzgerald also has loving parents and a healthy upbringing. Garth is awesome as a father and husband, so Castiel Fitzgerald would also be able to just express his feelings easily.)

How would Dean Winchester II interact with Sam Fitzgerald, I wonder. This Sam would be at least two years older than this Dean. If 15x20 happens two years after, then it's gonna be exactly a four-year age gap. Deja Vu back to 1x1 pilot.

SPN spinoff idea: TFW 3.0 = Sam & Castiel Fitzgerald + Dean Winchester II. Still saving people, hunting things. Monster of the week, or biblical stuff, either way. Still family business. Still two brothers plus another family friend (who very possibly could fall in love with them).

But it won't so much be a road trip story anymore. All of them know they always have homes to go back to, either Garth's place or Sam's place. Real old Sam is gonna be the new Bobby, Garth would help too, they can have a scheduled switch timetable, so neither of them would get overwhelmed or have to stay up all nights researching for their sons.

All four of the stay-at-home parents would have video calls frequently, talking about how worried Sam is for the boys, how much Garth feels proud of them, ...

Dean Winchester II will not be alone when he has to burn his father's body. Castiel Fitzgerald and the whole Garth's family will be there for Sam's hunter's funeral.

As the old TFW and destiel reunite in Heaven, the new TFW and destiel 2.0 continue happening in parallel on Earth. This is their heritage.
