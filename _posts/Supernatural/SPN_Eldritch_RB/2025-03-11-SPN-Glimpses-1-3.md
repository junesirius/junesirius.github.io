It's freezing cold outside. In fact, "freezing" is far too weak a term for this temperature. Any word that could describe this weather has already been blown away by the blizzard and frozen into the ground.

The snow has piled up and sealed the door shut. He has to climb out through one of the highest windows near the ceiling. The building is mostly buried under the unprecedented storm -- the fiercest and most sudden one that ever hit in all the recorded history, according to those people back inside.

Dean can feel every inch of his skin losing heat fast, he might only have minutes, or seconds, before his body is frozen into some ice sculpture. He may -- extremely likely -- be literally frozen to death, if he's not buried alive first.

But knowing what he knows now, there is no way he's just going to sit inside and do nothing. He could fight through Purgatory from one end to the other, certainly he can survive some snowstorm in Colorado.

Dean steps into the blizzard, and starts walking toward the mountaintop, where the rumors point. The snowflakes are as sharp as angel blades, cutting him bloody, but there is no dripping blood. Even the sliced veins freeze shut the moment they're wounded. The pain is sharp in the first minute, but numbs quickly. He doesn't feel like walking in the icy water anymore, more like boiling water. The cold burns hot. He knows some temperature sensors in his body must have been failing. But he can't care about that right now.

He can't see anything, there is nothing other than a whole complete blinding whiteness in every direction, with all kinds of different shades of pale. He pushes one step after another, but can't tell the difference between each step. He wonders if he's really moving uphill, or just repeating the same motion in the same place.

The storm grows fiercer when the top is nearer. The trees thin out, the snow darkens in color. Dean widens his eyes as far as they'll go, scanning the sky, the ground, the woods, the mountain. Searching the whole world for a glimpse of a color that doesn't belong to the white. Looking for a footprint, or a hint of beige.

"This is suicide, Dean." The voice, so familiar it aches, cuts through the storm, sounding up somewhere close by.

"Cas?" Dean spins around, turning sharply toward the sound.

"Dangerous, reckless, and stupid. You could die here, buried alive, and I'd never find you or your corpse again, you ever think about that?" Cas's voice, scolding. Sad.

"What?" Dean stills. Thinking, then tries, "You're not real, are you? I'm hallucinating."

"Hypothermia can lead to highly vivid and realistic hallucinations. It's been scientifically tested and confirmed." "Cas" steps out of the storm, standing in front of him. In his clean trench coat and straight suit, the blue tie tilted and backwards at the front. Hair unbelievably disheveled yet unmoving in the wind. Eyes as blue as the deepest sea and the clearest autumn sky. The view of the Angel of the Lord as he remembers from the first time they met, the look he forever dreamed about among all the other looks that came after.

"Cas," Dean murmurs, reaching for him, fingers catching nothing but snowflakes. The snow doesn't feel cold anymore.

A sad smile curls his lips as he looks "Cas" in the eyes. "I've been looking for you, Cas. Promised I'd find you and bring you home. But looks like I can't even keep that promise, I'm sorry."

"Cas" has a smile just as sad as his. "You're dying, Dean," He tells him, something he already knew. And then, "I won't let that happen. I can't."

Dean can't really think straight right now, can't fully process the meaning of the words. The cold has made his brain as sluggish as his hands and feet, everything working slower by the second, just like the gradually fading sound of his own heartbeat.

That is when the view in front of his eyes changes entirely. Dean blinks slowly, struggling to understand what he's seeing.

It is as if the storm is split into two halves, like a curtain being drawn open on an opera stage. To his left and right, snow and wind rage on, but right in front of him, in the center, a figure as tall as the sky emerges, stepping toward him slowly. Each step slams into the ground, shaking the earth like the giant from the Jack and the Beanstalk story.

Dean wants to step back, to look up, to speak. There are so many things he wants to do, instinct screams at him to run or fight, but his body is too frozen to move. So he just stares, feeling the newly risen adrenaline pumping fast, forcing his heart to beat harder. His brain struggles to parse the sight before him. The reality looks surreal.

The figure wears a long trench coat that reaches his knees -- tail of the coat taller than the highest trees in their surroundings. Dean looks up, lifting his head as far as his frozen neck allows, but still can't see the figure's face, can barely make out the hem of the coat whipping in the storm. He gasps, his sound caught in his throat.

It is Cas. Undoubtedly, impossibly, it's Cas. But it is so unlike Cas, not in any form Dean has ever known. Not in any history or legend. But it is Cas, for sure. He just knows.

Dean would recognize him anywhere, in any form. Not just by the trench coat, but by the *presence*. The weight of his gaze falling on to him even if he can't see his eyes; the warmth of concern radiating from his body, practically melting the snow and ice around them. And most of all, who else would ever like this, always come to him at the moment of dying. Hell is the first time, Green Room the second, Dean has long lost count of how many more there were.

"Cas." This time, Dean really is smiling. Dirt and snow and the smear of blood streak his face, making every small movement ache, but he's smiling anyway, wide and stupid.

He steps forward, but Cas pulls back. A thunderous sound rolls from above, as if it comes straight from the sky, low and deafening, like the wrath of the Greek gods befalling on Mount Olympus.

But it's not the sound of rage, or warning. Dean can't understand the syllables, but if he knows Cas at all -- which he does -- then he knows: this is his own name. He would know his own name in every single tongue Cas has ever spoken, and the tone would remain the same.

Dean takes another step forward, carefully, but Cas's figure takes another step back. One step, and he's a hundred feet farther. The blizzard around them roars to life once more, returning to its full intensity and fury. But closely around Dean, a small pocket remains calm and warm, protected from the storm, like a shimmering bubble in space, glowing gold and silver, the color of Cas's grace.

"What's wrong?" Dean manages, his voice swallowed by the wind the moment it leaves his mouth.

Cas makes another sound, just one word, not "Dean", certainly not "Hello".

"No, no, no, no! Cas!" Dean yells, desperate, instinctive. "Wait! Don't! Not 'Goodbye' again! Not so soon! Stay, please!"

Cas turns away, stepping aside. That is when he sees it. A tear in the space behind him, like a massive ugly wound of the reality standing vertical, gaping open like Sauron's evil eye glaring down at the earth. Gray and black smoke coils at the edge like windblown curtains, more ominous than when gates of Hell open. The blizzard pours straight out from the center of the rift, and God knows what else has come through that hole, or what is on the other side.

Cas must be holding it back with his body -- this enormous body he has now, however that happened.

"Cas..." Dean hates it he can't do anything, especially when he knows exactly what is about to happen next. It's the same nightmare that he's been having for ages, over and over, after the day the Cage opened, after Cas walked into the river. The same horror he feared every single night in Purgatory. And it seems, with Cas, it's just gonna keep replaying in reality.

Dean forces himself to run, willing his frozen legs and body into motion, trying to close the distance between them. He pushes as fast as he can. And Cas takes another step back, putting another hundred feet between them. Then another.

Cas is right in front of that huge tear in the dimension now. Bright light starts leaking from him, seeping into the opening, weaving across it like needle and thread mending a tear in fabric, closing it bit by bit. His body dissolving into the light.

"Please..." Dean begs, so quietly that even he can barely hear it. Cas's figure begins to fade, light dimming, the hole shrinking. But just before it's completely stitched shut by the bright light of grace, a slender thread of light detaches from the rest, flying toward Dean.

Dean watches it, dazed, not realizing his eyes are so teary that the light of the grace blurs and smears like soaked watercolor. The thin thread of light lands on his forehead, touches his skin, and immediately sinks in.

Warmth floods him from head to toe, like the best hot shower he could ever hope for in this moment, chasing out the last remnants of the storm's cold from his body. The exact same feeling as whenever Cas touches him, and heals him.

Dean looks up again. At the place where the tear of the space once was, there is now only a smooth stretch of open sky and air. There is no nasty thing from another dimension, there is no blinding light of needle and thread.

There is no Cas, again. Not even a sign to prove it wasn't a dream. Except for the lingering warmth still flowing through his body.

The raging snowstorm dies down, like the last drops of water sputtering from a faucet during an outrage. Then it stops completely. The world is fixed, at least this part of it, he realizes belatedly, when the tear is mended, when Cas is gone.

He stares at the sky as it clears. Blue as crystal. He blinks hard.

A piece of fabric drifts down from the middle of the air, slowly floating to the ground, landing on the snow. Beige-colored, trench coat texture, torn and bloodstained.

Dean picks it up, puts it into the chest pocket closest to his heart.
