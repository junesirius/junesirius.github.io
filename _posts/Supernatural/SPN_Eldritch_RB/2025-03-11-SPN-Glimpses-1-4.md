It is dark.

This place.

It is shredding.

Cutting.

Confusing.

Everything is in pieces.

Then they are not.

Floating.

Swimming.

Chaotic.

The dimension in between.

<br>

It takes time, a really long time, to find the pieces together.

But what is time, when time is not a dimension?

When time, can also be torn apart, like everything else in here.

Words are difficult to find, with characters and syllables.

Mind and body and grace and existence alike.

Which is the right place, for which piece of the puzzle, floating by.

Woven, with pain and bitterness and guilt and penance.

Kneaded, into every fabric.

Every fabric of the dimension.

Every fabric of one existence.

*Who is building me up this time?*

*Not God. Me.*

*I'm putting me together.*

*But, then, Theseus's Ship,*

*Who am I?*

<br>

It is dark.

Behind the curtain.

Lights are out.

Tear it down.

No,

Tear it open.

The light is on the other side.

<br>

Then,

Snow and cold.

Pain and real.

Torn and broken.

*I see you.*

<br>

*Hello.*

*I'm sorry.*

The lights are out again.

The curtain is drawn back.

Too quick, too short.

Back, dark, torn, away.

*Don't cry.*

*Goodbye.*
