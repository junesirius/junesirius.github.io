Dean spends the night at Missouri's place, then bids her goodbye first thing in the morning.

The psychic scrutinizes his face, asking in a caring, motherly voice, "What are you going to do?"

Dean dodges her eyes, hating the pity in them. "What I always do, drive around, look for signs, look for him. I'll come up with something."

"Think you'll be alright?" Missouri opens the front door for him.

"Ain't I always?" Dean manages to put a dangling smile on the lips, leaning in to give her a thankful farewell hug.

He leaves Lawrence, Kansas miles behind by the time the sun rises.

<br>

Life continues more or less the same, roads and bad diner food and cold coffee, nights and dreams and nightmares. Alone, with the Baby being the only company.

Dean crashes for a few hours of sleep once in a while, usually waking with a start, sweat streaming down his spine. He finds it difficult to tell apart the blackness of the night sky from the memory of that splitting dimension he went in during the seance. He would just continue driving, let the cold night wind dry the wetness on his skin and the corners of his eyes. Before long, the night wind is not even that cold anymore, he doesn't notice when spring is already around the corner.

He still runs into cases, now that not only searching for sightings of angels or giant creatures, but also reports of extreme natural disasters and strange behaviors of wild animals. He finds a nest of vampires after reports of unprecedentedly large wild bats, and ghosts of an entire family in a place where locals say the fog is always too thick and too cold. Most of the time, they are just pranks or false reports or actual natural phenomena, he drives to the said locations anyway, just to be sure. He almost gets caught in the middle of twin tornadoes, then a volcanic eruption.

A victim report from Kansas catches his eyes sometime around March, the keywords "blue handprint" and "internal organs liquified" poking at his nerves. His rational mind knows it can't be angels, can't be Cas, if anything. But his brain reads the word "blue" (like Cas's eyes) and "handprint" (like the one burned into his shoulder), and the next thing he knows, he's on US-50 heading west.

Dean drives into the town of Topeka, Kansas two hours later.

The coroner is not the most cooperative person to work with, and getting caught in the middle of the night in the coroner's office rummaging through an empty morgue where the bodies should have been certainly doesn't help his luck.

The djinn blinks her eyes blue as he finds himself tied to a chair, hands bound behind the body. That flash of electric blue is the last thing he sees before sinking into the view of Purgatory.

Dean snaps his eyes open, finding himself napping beside a tree stump. The sky, the ground, the tree, all the same bleak grey he remembers from the real Purgatory. For a moment, his brain tries to figure out which world is the reality, did he dream about getting out of Purgatory and running into the djinn case while he's been here all the time, or did he actually manage to get out and is now dreaming about it again inside the djinn's illusion?

He looks around.

Cas is there, standing by the tree just three steps away from him, in that dirty trench coat over a hospital gown, shoulders hunched. His peachy beard is as messy as Dean remembers.

Dean reaches for him, tentatively, placing a hand on his shoulder. The touch is solid.

Cas turns to him, a soft smile appearing. "Dean," he says, in his usual low gravelly voice, visibly relaxed.

"Cas." Dean finds the word choking. He studies his face. Castiel looks real, grimy and more human than angel, but looking so authentically real, with every little detail perfect. But Dean's gut knows too well it is only because he has every little detail stored in his own memory to manifest it.

He still allows himself to believe it is the real Cas, just for a second. Dean pulls him in, taking a long breath in then letting it out. He pats Cas on the back slightly, before letting him go.

"Are you alright?" Cas looks at him, eyes concerned. A look that would show on real Cas's face so very frequently.

Dean nods. Then, "Are you?"

"Yes, I'm fine," Cas answers, exactly the way Dean knew he would.

But he is not fine. The real Cas is not. Dean remembers that, and he knows every second he spent in this nasty djinn's illusion, is one second closer to his own death, let alone Cas's.

"We have to get out of here," he says automatically, looking for the way to the portal. Cas follows him quietly.

There are monsters and leviathans closing in behind them. There is a large bone blade in his hand.

The monsters seem to keep targeting Cas for attack, showing far more interest in the angel than the human, for some reason. Dean pulls Cas behind him, taking them out one by one, not stopping to question why the change of behavior.

He checks on Cas the moment these monsters are cleared out. "You okay?"

There are more fresh blood stains on Cas's clothes, Dean finds his own brain already starts painting images of deep cuts and wounds underneath the clothes, imagining a lifeless body Cas might turn to if he ever lets his guard slip for a split second. His jaw tightens at the thought, knowing it might be true.

Then Cas says, "I'm fine."

It feels like a conversation they've had a million times. In Purgatory, or in Dean's head.

They reach the portal. And Cas starts to say the usual notions of the portal being human-only and that he should be left behind. And as always, Dean doesn't listen, doesn't even bother arguing. He just holds his hand.

He crosses the portal, and this time, in this vision, Cas is pulled through with him. Right by his side, holding his hand tight.

*Is this how he gets to break the djinn's illusion?* Dean wonders. *Feels too easy.*

The black world waiting on the other side tells the answer otherwise. His eyes blink blankly, trying to understand the view, then gradually, lights and colors and shapes start to show, like a computer screen slowly loading an image.

It is the dimension in between. He realizes. The place that Cas said he is torn and stitched, sliced and spliced, broken apart and fused together, misshaped and reshaped.

Instantly, he looks at Cas.

Cas is still by his side, but his shape is deforming, like a crude animation of a rubber figure being stretched and squeezed, pulled apart.

"Dean." Cas's mouth moves, all the while his head starts to drift away from his body, involuntarily, so do his arms and legs. His body is stretched thin, limbs elongating until they tear from the torso. Wings unfurl from his shoulder blades, only to be ripped away one after another, feathers scattering in a chaotic flurry. His eyes blink in confusion -- not pain, just confusion -- looking at Dean like that's the only thing he can think of doing. Still that deep blue.

"No, no, no, no, Cas! No --" Dean lunges for the fragments, catching a feather or a piece of fabric, but each piece just keeps breaking down, splitting into smaller units right before his eyes. He can do nothing but watch as the horror unfolds, watch as Cas slowly, systematically, disintegrates into a mass of flesh and bon and feathers and fabric floating in space. Then dust. Then atoms.

Never has he ever seen a more terrifying horror movie.

Dean covers his mouth with both hands, choking back the petrified scream rising in his throat. Cold sweat pours down his forehead. His lips and throat are too dry and tight, he can't breathe.

It has been forever since he has to experience a sense of fear like this. The last time was perhaps when Sam took that fresh deep stab to the back and lay lifeless in his arms. The time before was when their Mom burning on the ceiling.

And then, like time rewinding itself, Cas is put back together. Nails returning to fingertips, fingers to hands, hands to arms, arms reattaching to the torso. Some unseen force fits the pieces together like placing puzzle pieces, reconstructing the angel, returning Cas to him. But with things here and there off, features and organs misplaced. His hands are swapped, his legs twisted at odd angles, the left eye sits where the mouth should be, the mouth at the ear's. A figure straight out of a Picasso painting.

Dean gasps in horror. His throat can't squeeze a single syllable of word out, not even it is "Cas" that he wants to say.

"Dean." Even in this forced grotesque form of Frankenstein, Cas manages to call his name, with the same intensity and urgency he always has. The eye in the right place and the eye that is not, both fixate on him, staring straight into him. "You have to let me go."

"No," Dean says, without hesitation. "Never."

"Dean, listen to me." Cas's shape gradually  begins to realign, correcting itself, returning to normal. The familiar look returns, the familiar face fixed, the familiar focused blue eyes locked on Dean's. "This place isn't real, and you know it. I'm not real, but you are. Let me go, that's your only way to wake up, to be safe. Or you will die." His eyes big and sad.

Dean swallows hard, knowing he's right. But, "I can't," he murmurs, and he knows it as a fact. "I don't know how to."

The dimension opens a tear before them.

"Please, let me save you. Cas, I have to." Dean holds out a hand. "I can't lose you like I lost every godforsaken thing I've ever cared about in my life."

His eyes sting, his voice sobbing.

Cas does not take his hand, so Dean drags him over, leading them both out of this creepy nightmarish dimension.

Only to find themselves back in Purgatory. Leviathans lurking. Vampires circling. The portal gleams atop the mountain, shining white light.

It is an infinite loop.

Cas draws his hand back, holding Dean's gaze. Hint of glittering tears at the corners of his eyes. "You have to go without me, Dean."

Dean eyes the monsters around them, looking back at the angel in front of him, voice trembling. "They'll kill you."

"Yes," Cas says, uncaring. "Let them. Or the djinn will kill *you*, Dean. This djinn feeds on fear."

"I'm not afraid of the monsters."

"But you're afraid of losing me." Cas smiles gently, reaching out a hand to stroke his cheek, then lets the hand fall. He says it again, softly but firmly, "Let me go. It's okay. I'll be fine. The real me outside will be fine too."

"God..." Dean wipes his eyes, pulling Cas into a tight hug, exhaling a broken breath against his shoulder, pressing his lips to the side of his disheveled hair.

Then he lets him go.

Dean runs toward the portal alone, not looking back. He hears the growls of the monsters, the sound of teeth tearing into flesh and fabric. He can still feel the weight of a pair of blue, blue eyes on his back, with a small relieved smile. Exactly the look he knows real Cas would have if he were really here.

Dean forces his eyes not to look back, wills his legs not to falter at the horrific sounds, and leaps through the portal.

He wakes up, and he kills the djinns that trapped him.

The corners of his eyes are still wet. He breathes out long and shaky.

The silver blade drops to the floor.
