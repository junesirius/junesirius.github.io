A loud flutter of wings adds to the sounds of millions of wings crashing and rustling, so loud and powerful it distinguishes itself from all the others. A strong gust sweeps through, sending the vultures perched on his back with claws digging into his spine blown away. The ones pecking at his arms lose their grip too, spreading their wings to keep balance. The edges and feathers of the wings brush against his open wounds, sending involuntary shudders through his body.

The surrounding sounds suddenly quiet. For a moment, Dean thinks if it might be his ears suddenly deafened, like a TV muted all of a sudden. But then he realizes the sound of wings is still there, though farther away, remote, distant, like behind a closed soundproof door. The sensation of feathers and wings is still on his skin -- which, remarkably, looks like he has skin again, at the places he was sure  were bleeding like a drained pipe mere seconds ago -- warm and soft.

The broken bones start to grow back, the torn tendons knitting back together, blood flowing through the veins smoothly, the skin feels new and tight. The cold wet sensation on his spine recedes, so does the burning dumbness on the back of his head. There is only a lingering familiar lukewarm touch on his skin exposed through the torn cloth, a careful fluffy sensation that is barely there.

It is not the vulture wings touching him. It is not.

Dean opens his eyes, lowering his arms. He is surrounded by something warm and vast, wrapped in it like the best natural feathery quilt, covered from head to toe like a cocoon, but with enough space to move too, not confined, but safe. No one could ever hurt him here, he knows instantly, not vultures, not any monster, not even God or Death themselves, Dean just knows.

It is dark, but through the faint flashlight he dropped inches from his feet, he sees the wings around him aren't pure black. They glitter with tiny little shine of silvery light, like the finest diamonds inlaid between the feathers. The most beautiful thing he's ever seen.

Dean doesn't need anything else to know who it is.

"Cas." He reaches out a hand, can't stop himself.

For a blink of time, he imagines there is nothing, just another dying hallucination, just his last warm mad dream like the pity Little Match Girl. But his fingertips land on the feathers. Soft at the tip, tender in the middle, strong at the root, disarranged under his touch. He takes a long breath in, and he smells sky.

"Cas, is that really you? These your wings?" His voice is still a bit shivering, wet. "So you're -- you're okay. More than okay. The wings, oh God, I never know they look like this, up close, I mean."

He takes another long drag of broken breath, feeling his heartbeat finally begin to slow, his brain dizzy from the adrenaline. Dean murmurs, quietly, "They're so beautiful, Cas. They're amazing."

He presses both palms on the wings in front of him, feeling the warmth that is slightly higher than his own passing onto the hollows of his hands. He might be imagining it, but underneath it, he feels a pulse. A living, pumping, steady pulse, beating in the rhythm of an elephant's heartbeat, the slow pace of a giant creature. He buries his fingers in, letting the feathers intertwine with the fingers, watching them part to allow his fingers to sink deeper into the sea of black feathers. For this moment, Dean feels safe, even if he knows he must be far from it, even if in his whole life, he never has truly been.

"This giant ancient bird Artemis told me about, thousands of miles wide and thousands of miles tall, stirring sea and sky, it's you, isn't it?" Dean tries hard to steady his breath, feeling proud. "I know it! I know it all along."

Cas doesn't answer.

In fact, Cas hasn't said a word or even shown his face, it is only the wings that Dean sees.

Only then does he realize that, and starts to frown. "Cas, buddy, I want to see you. What happened? Come down here, talk to me."

There is a high-pitched voice in a deafening volume rolling above his head, piercing the air in response. The same sound that blew up the glasses in the gas station the day he crawled out of his grave, back on Earth from the Pit tour. Castiel's true voice.

Dean covers his ears until the voice and echo between trees silences. "You can't speak human now?" He guesses, then adds quickly. "Okay, let's do this, knock once for no, knock twice for yes, we'll figure out other things later. Right or wrong, Cas? True-voice-only time?"

The wing wrapped closest to him moves, pulling away from him, the tip of it knocks on the ground twice.

Dean lets out a relieved chuckle. "Now we're talking. Good to see you again, Cas." He talks to the black wings in front of him, gesturing vaguely upward, feeling only a little weird. "Some part of you, anyway."

He tilts his head. "Hey, what's the deal with this *Amazing Colossal Man* show?"

Dean looks up, but can't seem to look beyond where Cas's wings cover. He can't tell if the blackness over his head is wing or night.

The tip of the wing that was responsible for tapping the ground for an answer hesitates. It draws a curve on the ground, then a point -- a question mark.

Dean can practically hear Cas's voice -- his low gravelly human voice -- saying, "I don't understand that reference," just from that movement.

He can't help feeling the tug at the corner of his mouth. "Anyway, thanks for saving my ass, again. You got any idea what's up with those killer birds out there?"

The hesitation again. Dean watches the wing tip shift like a human wrestling fingers in the grill of a difficult question. But then, it taps twice on the ground.

Dean claps his hands together with relief. "Great! Mind showing me?"

There is a brief high-pitched growling sound overhead again. Still completely unintelligible to human ears, but somehow, Dean thinks, he senses something edgy and pained just from the sound of it. His heart clenches at the feeling of it, even if he has no idea of the meaning.

"Or not, if it's... making you uncomfortable," he tries, regretting the question.

Slowly, the wrapped layers of wings around him begin to withdraw -- Dean misses them the moment they pull away. From the outermost to the innermost where the feathers slightly brush against his back and shoulders, they unfold. One wing after another.

There are three pairs.

As tall as the redwoods surrounding them, as wide as the open space allows. From where Dean stands, he can't see from one end to the other, and his human brain can't seem to comprehend the shape in between that holds the wings together. Must be something celestial, he decides, something that is the true Cas.

The wings flap once, all three pairs together. A gusty blow of strong wind sweeps through the woods, shaking trunks and crowns, leaves falling like downpouring rain. Those vultures that are as big as half his height with wings longer than his arms, just get blown away like small gnats puffed away by a huff of air, finally leaving behind a small circle of clearing. But Dean can hear them steady and ready to fly back at any time.

Cas flaps his wings again. Then a third time.

But even he can't keep that up forever.

With each flap, his wings shift direction, sending gust swirling in all directions, circling around something.

Something too dark to be made out in the forest night. Dean points the flashlight in that direction, widening his eyes then squinting, looking hard, trying to see what's there.

Then he sees it. A tear in space, not too different from the one he saw last time when Cas emerged in the snowstorm, but the tear was easier to notice in the all white background than the all black one like right now.

But it is the same shape of wound that tears the reality, an opening leading to somewhere unknown, somewhere that probably doesn't belong to any space at all. The vultures pour from the tear faster than shooting bullets, flying out like the most annoying insects in the world.

Judging by the moment of the wings, Castiel is tiring out fast. He retreats closer to the gap step by step. Dean tries to move toward him.

Cas lowers one of the lowest wings, putting it right in his way, sending a clear enough message of warning him from another step forward. And Dean can see why. There are too many killer birds at the center. If the ones attacking him earlier were giving him a hard time, going any closer could mean being torn apart by a tornado of beaks in an instant. Not even Cas could heal him fast enough if that ever happened.

He stays where that wing instructs him to. The feeling of helplessness comes back. The same feeling he had when he was in that snowstorm on the Rocky Mountain, the same gut-tightening instinct of what is going to happen next as the wings inch closer to the tear.

"You're leaving again, aren't you?" Dean asks him, frowning deeply, eyes stinging. Not expecting any answer. Because they both already know.

The wing tip bends slightly, wrapping around him briefly -- the closest thing to a farewell hug. A feather brushes his face, right at the corner of his eye. Dean swallows. There is no tear, he knows there isn't, not now anyway.

His hand reaches up, feeling the touch of the feather, leaning into it.

"Did Purgatory do this to you? Pulling you here and there? Making these whatever weirdass portals all over? God, I have so many questions." Dean feels the twist in his stomach tighten, the knot turning over. He thinks he's gonna be sick.

His voice drops quieter. "Do you choose to leave, or do you have to, Cas?" He pushes the words out, tasting the edge of them, each as sharp as the knives and blades and the beaks of those birds, cutting his tongue and throat bloody. "I fight so damn hard, just want you back, want you stay, want you okay. Is that too much to ask?"

The shrieking angelic voice that answers him is even more pained than the previous one he heard. Dean can't imagine what it is that Cas is saying.

The vultures gather back closer as Cas's wings flap increasingly slower and visibly more exhausted and heavy. One of the creatures lands its claws on his wings in the mid-sky, and more follow. A burst of new smell of copper and iron floods the air. A rain of crimson starts to fall to the ground.

Dean yells, "Cas, watch out!" But there is nothing he can do. He holds the demon blade up in a posture of throwing it out, but he can't be sure it wouldn't hit Cas instead. Some of the birds hover back, diving in his direction. Feet away, then inches.

That is when Cas starts glowing. Not too different from last time on the snow mountain, except a lot more intense. Dean shuts his eyes the moment the light brightens up, starting at the outline of the wings.

His brain itches to steal a look, to see the wings in light. He imagines them like a phoenix reborn in fire (a drastic brilliant light show as the legends speak of, as that tremendous bird would be like, not the man-shaped creature from the Wild West), but Cas would definitely be pissed -- pissed at himself, that is -- if Dean gets his eyes burned out because of his grace, even if it's Dean's own stupid curiosity.

The bright light scorches the backs of his eyelids hot and red, like facing straight at the sun with closed eyes. He waits, heart pounding loud in his chest. He listens, the sound of wings wanes and subsides, the warm and soft touch of feathers withdraws.

Dean opens his eyes when he can't hear any more fluttering. His vision still overstimulates and shakes with a too bright overlay, making the darkness before him even harder to make out. He blinks and rubs at his eyes, clearing the water forming slowly that must be triggered from the bright light, not from whatever breathless slump inside his chest.

There is no scar of the space left, there is no giant black wing. No more human-eating killer vultures. No Cas.

A crow tentatively croaks, hopping in the grass, then flies off. That is all.

In the place where there was the opening, on the ground, lying on top of the thick coating of fallen leaves, there is a single long feather.

As long as his forearm. As black as the starry sky with glittering light between. A hint of blood stains the tip.

Cas's feather.

Dean's fingers caress the feather, ever so softly, so lightly. Just like the way the wings it belonged to touched his cheek mere moments ago. Ever so gently. The touch of a phantom hand, reaching from a distant forgotten dream.

He presses the feather to his lips, then puts it next to the piece of trench coat fabric. His heart beats a skin's distance away.
