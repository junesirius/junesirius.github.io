The dimension in between is -- for lack of a better word -- confusing. It's kaleidoscopical, it's a meat grinder of light and darkness and everything in between, a blender of color and shape, a garbage disposal of mind and body.

Starting with darkness, then lights from other dimensions start flashing in, like stars from the other side of a curtain, then brighter than sunshine.

It takes forever to find words and thoughts again, to find the pieces that belong to oneself and put them back together. It takes longer to see the lights, to watch them glow and shine, and even longer to realize what they are.

Prayers can't reach this dimension, yearning does. The stronger the emotion, the brighter the lights. It starts with sparkles, the brightness of comets, on and off, flickering, blinking, flying past; then grows to that of Mercury and Venus, as they're seen from Earth; soon becomes as anchoring and grounding as Polaris in Ursa Minor, as bright and consistent as Orion and Perseus; until eventually, it is supernova explosion.

There is a similarity between this place and deep space in the more familiar dimension.

It feels familiar. It feels like home.

It takes a while, but the realization finally dawns: *Why are the lights so bright, so calling, so intense that I want nothing but to stare into it, to go after it, to merge into them -- because it is a beacon, sent by the one human being who anchors my existence, who lights the way back. It is Dean, calling for me.*

<br>

The barrier that divides the dimensions, is nearly impossible to tear open. It is no cotton fabric of a curtain, it is as thin as air but one cannot slice air with any blade, so it might as well be a diamond wall, infinitely thick.

There is no way through -- none that I can manage by myself.

But I'm not doing it by myself.

I can't hear him, can't really see clearly enough of his whereabouts, but the light of emotion radiating from him, directly coming from his beating heart, that is all I ever need.

When the light bursts so bright and desperate, it changes colors, it shines red and bloody, like a wound of the space. Like the bleeding mark on the chest of a thorn bird, whose final song echoes with a sonorous melody as the sharpest thorn pierces its heart. The power and intensity are so strong and insistent, they can cut through everything.

They cut the divide thin, I push through. There he is, Dean. But dying. Almost always, dying. Even more so, when I'm around.

More so, when the tear is open, and danger seeps through.

I watch myself, stepping over the tear. Hands, feet, cloth; wings, rings, eyes. The vessel, the angel, the monster, the bad luck. These days, it seems, I'm always the combination of all of these. The eye of the disaster storm, the reason Dean is in danger.

"I'm here now," I want to say. The sound comes out harsh and sharp, too loud for human ears. Dean's hands cover his ears. I'm hurting him again. It seems, I'm always hurting him, one way or another.

I mute my own voice, ignoring the chanting deep within, repeating Dean's name. Ache. It doesn't matter. I don't matter. It should be about Dean. It's always all about Dean.

"Stay," I hear him say. Half from his lips, half from prayer, reaching deep into my core.

"I need you," I hear him think. Don't need to invade his mind, the thought is already loud enough.

*What do you need me for, Dean?* I wonder. I heal him. I help him to his feet. I wipe his tears. The ones haven't fallen yet.

I put my wings around him, leaning into the warmth of the human body. Greedily. Selfishly.

Taking in his whole existence, feeling his touch, grasping the memory. Getting prepared.

*I miss you too.* I'm thinking. Never told him, never going to.

*I'm sorry.* I see blood. Then I see tears.

I see danger. And I see pain. The bright light in his soul, never more blinding.

Why is the word "tear" both the sad salty water like the sea, and the broken wound that never truly heals? Because they're, really, the very same thing.

A doorway opens in two directions: one way out, the other to keep Dean safe.

A crossroads.

Think carefully, choose wisely.

It is an easy one, really.

Me, or him.

It is never a decision that needs pondering.

Stepping aside, stepping back.

Wound of the dimension, fixed by a body already broken -- sounds poetically fair. And perfect for penance.

I am back where I was. The deforming, confusing place. The dimension in between.

I still hear the crying. His calling.

The sound of tears dropping.

And the beat of his heart.
