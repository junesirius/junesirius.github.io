"Thank you for saving me," Cas says, once they finally pull apart.

"Any time." Dean grins. "You can thank me when we get you back into your body. Then we can do this properly."

They almost forget they're still only halfway done.

And the world is probably still on the ending track.

"We settled all the pieces?" Dean checks on Cas. "Everything inside and outside, angel and human? Fixed everything?"

Cas nods. "As good as we can for now."

There is still a faint sound deep down somewhere humming something heavy, if they had to guess, the shitty things never really go away for good, especially when the things they really want to get rid of is just a thought that's taken root. They can't even really tell whose it is, maybe both. Dean's known it his entire life, can feel it like a stubborn dark shade lingering in the corner of a whole palette of thoughts. But at least it hasn't solidified into a full sentence of thought yet, so Dean counts it as a win for now. Cas agrees quietly.

They shift their attention back to the outside. Reality sinks back in.

Dean checks on Cas's body immediately. The lights and flowing grace are more dazzling than ever. The whole ground where the giant body once lay is like a field made of light and energy. In the center of all the brightness, Dean is kneeling beside Cas's body, hands held together. The body -- Cas's body, made of flesh and blood like any human -- is returned to normal human size now.

The buzzing of the overcharged air is louder than ever, the electricity in the air makes every hair stand on end. Any friction feels like it could trigger a spark. Dean spares a split second to glance at the tear in space and the wildly darting aurora lights in the sky. Earth feels like it's on the verge of exploding, like a gigantic overcharged battery, about to burn like the Sun at any moment. Dean returns his attention to Cas, hoping they still have at least a minute or two.

Dean separates their hands, the lights stop pouring out of him, the ones already out there still surround the body. He regards the face of the body, the closed eyes, the crumpled coat. The body looks just like an empty shell, a doll, there is no expression on that face, no similarity to a life. Nothing like a man sleeping, more like a house with no one inside. He shifts uneasily.

"Want to try the first ride now?" Dean asks, trying to hide the nervousness.

*Honestly, not really. I'm spoiled in here.* Cas stretches mentally, his grace already starting to unfurl as he sends the last thought.

"I know, buddy. That's on me." Dean can't help chuckling, the worry dies down slightly.

He squeezes Cas's hand in the mental image one last time, then reluctantly lets it slip away. Cas puts his palms on Dean's cheeks, touching him one last time, then stands up from the sofa. The mental human form melts into bright silvery-blue light, casting dark shadows on the wall in the shapes of three spinning rings and three pairs of wings. Dean watches in fascination as the light flies upward, out of his mind's eye.

The warm sensation of Cas's grace dancing around his soul lingers just one moment longer, then Cas flies out. Dean watches the light flow from his mouth, moving into the vessel's, already missing the company inside his mind. That corner of his brain where Cas has occupied, the side of the sofa where the sunshine newly reached, that spot feels too empty now.

Dean pushes down the bubbling sense of emptiness, forcing his attention onto the body, onto Cas.

The new swarm of light has fully flowed inside the body, Dean assumes that means Cas, with all his existence, has moved into his new home now, in his entirety. He reaches back for Cas's physical hand, waiting for a twitch in the fingers or a blink of the eyes, anything.

Dean holds his breath, waiting, until his lungs protest. He resumes the breath, sharp and uneven. Cas's body still doesn't show any sign of life. No rising chest, no breath, no heartbeat, no pulse.

*You miss the timing, you're stuck with a corpse.* That was what Meg had warned him.

"No, no, no, Cas! Wake up, buddy." Dean starts to panic, he pats Cas's face, shaking his shoulder. His voice shudders, broken. "What did I do wrong? Don't do this to me, Cas."

He doesn't hear Cas's answer, only the louder and louder sound of electricity blending together from all directions, like the biggest thunder the world has ever known.

After Cas leaves, the view and all senses return to a human level, dull and limited, but Dean has a pretty good guess of what's happening. The sky is boiling with colors, all the red and purple and green dancing relentlessly, merging and splitting, forming shapes beyond imagination. The whole sky looks like it's about to tear open an entrance to the universe and pour everything down through the hole, just to make more space for more colors and light. The plasma must be reaching some extremely critical threshold now. His heart sinks to the lowest abyss.

"Can't believe it's still gonna end like this," Dean murmurs bitterly, letting go of Cas's hand. He fumbles on the ground for the demon blade he dropped earlier, and turns to face the tear of the dimension.

*Right when he thought he could have what he wanted for once, everything is gonna go to wreck again. Classic.* Dean almost laughs, at his own naivety thinking things would just be fine, at the cruel joke the world and fate throw at him.

"Here goes nothing." Dean grits his teeth, aiming the tip of the blade at his heart, closing his eyes. "*Death is an infinite vessel.*"

His hands begin to apply pressure to the blade, but the expected piercing pain through the chest does not come. Instead, he feels his wrists gripped tight by another hand, and a gravelly voice growls, "Dean."

Dean snaps his eyes open. There he is. Cas. Beautiful, glaring, bright, furious. He snatches the blade from Dean's hands, Dean can't find strength to resist. He can only throw his arms around Cas and hold him tight, breathing out shakily. "Thank God, Cas. I thought it didn't work."

"It took longer than I'd like to settle everything down in here. But I did not expect to see I'm almost too late *again* the minute I come back." Cas still sounds pissed.

"Oh, that," Dean pulls back from the hug, rubbing his nose, looking like a child caught stealing from a piggy bank.

"Yes, that! Thought we were over this self-sacrifice-to-save-the-world routine." Cas snaps.

"You got a better idea to fix it? 'Cause I don't really want to condemn the world again." Dean challenges weakly.

"Actually, I do. I just didn't think it was something I could have or use until very recently."

Dean raises his eyebrows, waiting for an elaboration.

Cas glances at the entangled soul-grace light still lingering on the ground, gas-liquid like, massive and blinding, still shaped loosely like a human figure, as if the phantom giant of his own form hasn't fully dissipated. He then looks at the tear, and finally back at Dean.

"It needs energy to fuel the patch, and something tremendous to close it temporarily, probably something infinite to close it for good," Cas starts. Dean nods, half understanding, half encouraging in anticipation.

"Angel grace is a good starting point -- it's a lot of energy," he pauses, and levels Dean a look. "And I supplied it with millions of years of knowledge and memory I had the last two times. It's not infinite, but with all the things I saw and knew, all the history of the universe from the beginning of time, all the people I witnessed and memorized, all the emotions I felt. Everything in my mind, the library you saw, it was enough to keep the tears closed long enough for the world to be safe for generations -- for you to be safe for your entire life. That was my initial plan this time too."

Dean makes a gesture as if he's going to argue, but Cas presses his hand down, just continues. "But now we have something better, so much better. We have the free energy," he gestures to the residual light on the ground, "the energy converted from the disappearing mass of the shrinking body, the beautiful physics rule of Mass-Energy Conversion. I have to admit, even I forgot to take it into account. And also from the chain reaction of your soul and my grace. We have more than enough energy."

"And the infinite part?"

"You see, Dean. Death is not the only infinite thing, and there is something else, so much more abundant and tremendous than the past and memory, so easy to forget the potential -- the future." Cas squeezes Dean's hands, pulling him closer, almost speaking directly into his breath. Dean can't tear his eyes away from the Angel. "The future is limitless, countless, endless. With you, between us, now there are infinite possibilities for where the future can go. The *possibilities* of what the whole world can become because of us, that is superfluous even for a different dimension."

"Wow," Dean gasps, truly awed, heart shaken. *That is the hottest thing I've ever heard. Poetic, too.*

He looks at Cas, almost expecting him to have already picked up the thought. Then he remembers they are not sharing a body anymore. So instead, he sends the message through prayer.

Cas smiles. "Yes, it is indeed very poe--"

Dean doesn't let him finish, he can't wait any longer. He's already pulling him in to close the very small remaining distance, and presses his lips to the open ones of Castiel's. The sentence is cut short.

He feels the dry and chapped lips, the warm and soft sensation, Cas's hands in his hair, his in Cas's. Sensations he missed when they were both in his head. Turns out, the mind just can't imagine everything. And this, this is so much better.

And he can't wait to see the infinite possibilities of the future, like Cas said, assuming the world doesn't end before that. Dean chances a look at the nasty tear of the dimension, the energy converted from the body mass is flying toward the gap as they busy themselves. The edge of the tear is starting to patch up from bottom to top, like the times he watched Cas's grace snitch them up on the Rocky Mountain and in the Redwoods.

Cas grunts a groan under his lips, complaining about his distraction. Dean makes a chuckling sound in his throat, putting his full attention back on Cas, ignoring the rest of the world now.

Cas's body is warm and solid under his touch, his tongue soft and gentle, his dark hair tangled in Dean's fingers, reminding him of when his fingers were intertwined with Cas's astonishingly beautiful starry-black wings and feathers. He tastes the clean earthy flavor of Cas's breath, reminded of the fresh wet air after a hot summer afternoon downpour. He feels the vibration from his heartbeat through the skin, hears his faint moaning sound in the throat. Dean uses all his human senses to feel Cas, to absorb him, wondering if he would feel him differently if he could have angelic senses just for a minute for this, if Cas feels him differently.

The world is forgotten in moments like this, all Dean can think of is Cas, and those infinite, literally world-saving, earth-turning futures ahead of them. And Cas, by the calm happy look on his face, his eyelashes quivering like butterfly wings, is thinking the same.

The kiss is not broken until long after the world falls silent.

"Listen," Cas manages, after what feels like forever. Time must have paused for them, the world must have stopped spinning for them.

Dean pants lightly, leaning his forehead against Cas's, tilting his head slightly to do as he's told.

"I don't hear anything," he reports. The surroundings are quiet, only the sound of pine needles rustling in the light breeze.

"Exactly," Cas smiles.

There is no hum of electricity, no charged air, no prickling feeling on the skin. Just the wind, the leaves, the natural quiet.

They look up at the sky. The aurora borealis still shimmers above the canopy, but it's returning to what it used to be, what it should be. Gentle waves of red and green take turns drifting across the sky, moving as the flowing wind moves the air. The view is still breathtakingly beautiful, yet no longer earth-shatteringly disturbing.

They look at the sky together, enjoying the view.

"Think that means the world is not gonna end anytime soon?" Dean beams.

Cas nods, content. Happy.

They go back to share another soft peck of kiss, then head toward the Impala.

The world moves on, the tear closed, the wounds patched. And the infinite future, just begins growing from here.

*Death is not the only infinite vessel. So is freedom. So is love.*
