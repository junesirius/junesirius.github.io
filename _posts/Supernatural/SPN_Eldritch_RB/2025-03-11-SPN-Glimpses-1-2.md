There is still work to do. There's always work, somewhere. Monsters, ghosts, something dark, something evil, something lurking in the night, waiting to tear people's hearts out or drink their blood dry.

Dean is good at finding things in the dark. But this time, he's looking for something in the light. Something bright and glaring, fluffy and feathery, something -- someone -- holy and angelic. *The angel.*

As much as he would say angels are nothing more than monsters with good PR, as many times as Cas has explained he doesn't have a harp, it seems that when he thinks of Cas, he still can't help but picture some shiny halos and wings in places he can't see. The same image he had in his mind at four years old, every night when his mom told him angels were watching over him. So that's what he looks for.

It starts turning into a routine. Dean gets into the habit of picking up a piece of newspaper at breakfast and reading through it over coffee. Then he sits in the cafe for the whole day, going through people's mention of angelic encounters online. He scans and scrolls, reads and looks, squints at the words of the witnesses and illustrations from so-called visionaries, thinking, if any of these can be a sign of Cas. If any of them can be luckier than he is, and has a glimpse of Cas while he cannot.

Then he drives, and reads, and asks around if there is anything strange and holy happening, anything like sudden increased heat, or bright light and thunderous sound. And he orders more papers. More coffee. Then he hits the road again.

The days and roads are muffled together. Dean distantly realizes he might be getting as bearded and dirty as he was in Purgatory, and he decides he doesn't care. He punches the word "angel" into the laptop search bar again.

There are some pagan gods in Wyoming, some werewolves in Michigan, and then some more pagan gods in Colorado. Dean takes care of them.

He had hoped maybe some of those pagan gods could have enough juice that he could negotiate to use. But at the end of the day, none of them are anything more than a bunch of bloodthirsty sons of bitches. Dean buries his knife in their chests or cuts their heads off, whatever works.

Blood from gods and creatures splatters across his face. Dean gets so used to it now he doesn't flinch or blink.

Some of these days, Earth feels no different from Purgatory. Full of ugly things, and none of the one he's looking for.

He still prays every night. And he drives on.

By November, he has cleaned out a nest of vampires in Washington and killed a nasty specter in Missouri. Winter is falling onto him fast. But the cold is the last thing he's worried about.

The first snow catches him when he's in Rocky Mountain, Colorado, trying to take a shortcut through the state, when a blizzard nearly buries half the car. He ends up staying in a tourist center on the waist of the mountain, stuck with a group of chatty tourists too dumb to travel without checking the weather report. He stares out the window at the roaring snow painting the whole world white and blank. Separated from the rest of the world.

There was no snow in Purgatory. Or rain. Or sun.

Everything was just gray and bleak, the trees half-dead with only trunks left standing, the ground covered in the dirt of corroded skeletons.

So at least, if nothing else, the snow is a good reminder this really is Earth. Dean watches the strong wind blow snowflakes as large as his palm against the glass, adding layers after layers. The view is soon blocked by the thick cover of snow and ice.

"No, I'm telling you, it's true, there are yetis in these mountains. Legends say they only come out in storms like this, feeding on lost hikers. The snow hides their tracks too well so they are super difficult to find, but we still managed to snap some photos." Some distant chatter reaches his ear. Dean focuses on the bitter coffee in his hands, trying to tune out any talk of new monsters or myths. He isn't really in a hunting mood right now.

Cold seeps in through the gaps of the windows.

He hears laughter from the crowd, whatever photo that guy is showing around, the rest of the group isn't buying it. A young woman's mocking voice is loud enough for him to hear from across the lobby:"This can't possibly be a Bigfoot print, Hector. What do you take us for, idiots? Look at the footprint, it's not even barefoot, might as well be a size-hundred dress shoe. Unless you're saying yetis start wearing suits and dress shoes now?" The crowd bursts into laughter.

Dean ducks his head and takes another sip of his coffee that's already gone cold. Cas used to wear dress shoes. It's been a long time since he saw him in the suit though, with everything so messed up and he ended up in a hospital gown that even got carried over into the other side of the portal. Dean finds himself missing that suit and that funny little backward tie.

He doesn't realize a tiny little curl has started pulling on the tip of his lips.

It's been too long. The last time they were both themselves, it feels like years and years ago. Decades even, so it feels. Before Purgatory, before broken Sam, before the Leviathans, or Raphael. A long, long time ago, when he could still straighten his ties, and tell Cas he's "also an FBI", only to watch the badge get displayed upside down.

God, how he wishes this were still then.

His lips drop entirely. He drinks another sip of  coffee. It's gone completely cold.

"If you don't believe the photo, I guess you won't believe what I saw with my own eyes, then," the man that must be Hector insists, voice rising over the lingering chuckles that haven't died down. "I swear to God, the day I took the photo, I saw a yeti way bigger than any on record. Must've been at least sixty feet tall, and the weirdest thing was its color. Not like the usual white yetis, this one was beige. And it stood so straight, if I didn't know any better, I might say it was a giant in a trench coat."

Dean jerks his head up so fast the movement even startles himself. He jumps to his feet, marches towards the group, and grabs the man by the collar before he registers what he's doing. "What did you say?" he growls right into the man's face.

Hector stutters. "Chill, man. Just some story time. I was telling the ladies about the other night on the mountain. Just so happened to see this weird-ass yeti."

"The trench coat, what did it look like?" Dean shakes his collar. The man is practically lifted to his toes like a cat caught by the scruff.

"Are you crazy? I don't know, just a trench coat! I mean, it's probably nothing, lights and reflections or something," Hector protests, pushing at Dean's shoulder.

Dean lets him go. "And you said he was on top of the mountain? In a snowstorm like this one?"

"*He*?" Hector snorts, flattening his wrinkled clothes. "Yeah, sure. On the highest top, standing next to a big fire pit with cooked human meat, dancing with other lady yetis!" The group of tourists erupts into louder laughter.

Dean turns around, walking straight toward the door.

"Sir, it's too dangerous to go outside in this weather!" One of the staff members calls after him.

Dean doesn't look back. "I'm going," he says.
