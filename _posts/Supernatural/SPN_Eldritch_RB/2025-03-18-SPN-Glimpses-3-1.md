Dean parks the car by the roadside, sitting behind the wheel a moment too long, chewing on the words he might need later. The house looks the same as it did the last time he visited almost a decade ago.

He checks through the curtained window, wondering if the owner is in the house now.

He raises a hand, the front door opens before his knuckles reach it.

"Dean Winchester." The woman regards him, a small smile forming.

"Missouri." Dean returns the smile, leaning in to give her a hug.

"It's been so long." Her hands pat his back gently, then pull away. Her eyes are sharp and pointed, but now softened by a knowing, compassionate look. "I'm sorry about the angel."

Dean raises his eyebrows.

"You were just thinking about him," Missouri eases into the room, ushering him in. "In fact, I think that's all you can think about. Am I right?"

Dean swallows, lowering his eyes to the floor, letting his feet carry him through the place automatically. "Yeah, uh, yeah, he's the reason why I... Sorry I didn't visit earlier."

Missouri sets a cup of coffee in front of him, didn't ask if he wanted tea or anything. Dean takes it, appreciated.

"Eight years ain't a short time, but I understand," she says, settling onto the couch across the small coffee table. "Your father sat in that very spot right after the fire, and I told him what he needed to know. How can I help you, Dean?"

Dean's mind falters for a second at that, old memories of his Dad and Mom and the haunted old house flood back in, but he gives a long exhale and pushes them down. "Cas is not dead," he says, defensive. Not like Mom. And he's not his Dad. "I just need some help to bring him back, that's all."

Missouri nods once, silent, her eyes prompting him to continue.

"There was an old friend a few years ago, a really good real-deal psychic," Dean remembers Pamela's bright flirtatious smiles, then the burned-out eye sockets, then bleeding stab wounds in her stomach. He has to force down a flinch. "That was way before we knew anything about angels, and she set up this seance, demanding Cas show his face. It didn't end well," he swallows again, "but it worked. I think Cas actually showed up and talked to her in some psychic spiritual dimension."

"And you're wondering if I can do something similar and let you talk to Castiel the same way," Missouri finishes for him.

Dean nods quietly. "Can you do that?" He tries hard not to let the desperation and hope spill all over in his voice, but Missouri probably hears it all.

She considers, eyes searching his face. And whatever she finds there, it seems to satisfy a question she didn't ask.

"Yes, I suppose," she says. Dean lets out a long breath. "There will be risks, but it can be done. It would be easier if there's something I can use as a medium."

"Medium?"

"Something from the angel. Things he can recognize as his, to guide his way to the call," Missouri explains.

That rings a bell. Dean automatically touches the handprint on his left shoulder beneath his jacket, knowing the red burning mark is still there. Back then, that mark was all they had that has a direct link to Cas, but now, he has more.

Dean reaches into his inner chest pocket, putting the trench coat fragment and the blood-stained black feather on the table between them. His fingers linger at the edge of the feather, not leaving. Both of them still carry the same temperature from his body warmth.

"I have these," he tells Missouri. "Cas left them behind when, emm, the last two times we saw each other, right before he disappeared. Will they work?"

Missouri reaches out to touch the cloth. Dean's fingers twitch involuntarily like he has the strongest urge to snatch it back, to not allow anyone but himself touch it, or even see it, but he holds the hands where they should be.

"I believe so." Missouri stands from the couch. Dean follows the motion without thinking. The woman eyes his eagerness. "A seance requires certain preparations. I would've said I'd let you know when it's ready, but I think you can't stand just sitting here drinking coffee, so might as well come over and make yourself useful. Help me set it up."

"Yes, Ma'am." Dean nods gratefully.

They use the round dining table for the work, Dean watches as Missouri paints a pentagon that covers the whole surface, then adds Enochian symbols and some loosely familiar marks on four of the corners, with the last corner marked by a painted open eye. Dean looks at it, having an odd feeling that it's staring back at him.

"What do those symbols mean?" He can't help asking. Call it a work habit.

Missouri lights five candles in the center matching each corner while she answers. "The air, the earth, the fire, the water. All the basic elements. And this, is your door." She points at the eye. "The seance itself is actually not complicated, the difficult part is finding him and talking to him, if he is willing to show."

"That reminds me, the accident last time, Cas's true form burned that friend of mine's eyes out," Dean admits, a little guiltily, glancing at the symbol of the eye again, remembering Pamela's scream and the fire bursting from her sockets, the fake white eyeballs she had to wear later. "Probably don't look at him directly then."

But still, somehow, his mind wanders afar, wondering what it is that Pamela really saw -- a figure as tall as the Chrysler Building like Cas once so casually slipped? A light as bright and burning hot as the sun which no human should face directly? If there has to have one good thing to come out of that blindness, he hopes Pamela at least had the chance to see the most bright and beautiful thing in the whole universe before losing her sight.

"Good to know," Missouri replies, her tone flat. "But I ain't gonna be the one looking, you are."

"What?"

"I believe he'd be more willing to come and talk to you than to me," Missouri states, matter-of-fact. "I'll lead the way, and you can have some catch-up."

"How does it work? Some kind of out-of-body spirit-walking experience?" Dean frowns.

"Only the eyes of your mind will travel, going into the dimension where he is," Missouri answers briefly, as if this is enough to understand how psychics work.

Dean figures there is no point asking for more details, he'll find out soon enough.

They sit at the table, holding hands. Dean takes the seat right in front of the painted eye. The trench coat fragment rests in their joined hands on Dean's left side, the feather on the right.

Missouri closes her eyes. Dean glances at the candle flames until they leave a flickering burns in his vision, he shuts his eyes as well.

"Castiel, come to us before this circle," Missouri begins, her voice slow and steady. "Dean Winchester requests your appearance."

Dean's heart skips a beat at the mention of his own full name. He stares into the blackness behind his eyelids, thinking hard: *Cas, come on. I'm here, where are you?*

Missouri repeats the chanting. Dean prays alongside her voice, as if it's a chanting of his own.

"Castiel, come to us before this circle."

*Cas, come to me, please.*

"Dean Winchester requests your appearance."

*Talk to me, what happened?*

"Castiel, come to us."

*I need you. Please.*

The candle lights in the center of the table start flickering violently. A high-pitched sound begins, quiet and distant at first, then increases its volume rapidly as if the source is approaching, something flying closer. The air vibrates with electricity. Light bulbs nearby explode. The table shakes violently.

Dean holds his breath.
