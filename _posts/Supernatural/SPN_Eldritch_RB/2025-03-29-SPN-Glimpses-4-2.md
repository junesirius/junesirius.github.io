---

Dean stays awake the whole night driving away from Topeka, Kansas, running as far away as possible. But the memory of that messed-up illusion world doesn't take it easy on him for the sake of the distance.

The distortion and deformation of Cas's body, of his wings, haunts in his vision. The stretch of road ahead is barely lit by the car's headlights. In the dark corners just beyond the light, he sees the illusion replaying itself at the periphery of his eyes. One version after another, all variations of Cas's figure show up, always troubled, always torn and broken, always wounded and helpless, standing in the corner of his sight, disappearing the moment he turns his head to look. Cas is never really there. But the figures always are.

He hears Cas's voice too, now that the fake world has just reminded him of that deep grave tone he didn't realize he missed so much. The sound takes root in his brain, speaking at his ear, sometimes from afar, other times as if he's right next to him, sitting at the shotgun, reading a piece of news on some paper, or saying some silly everyday conversation.

Dean has to turn his head to the passenger seat half a dozen times, only to see it empty.

The lack of sleep only makes it worse.

Dean distantly wonders if this is what it felt like, back when Sam or Cas had that craziness tumor in their heads. Seeing and hearing Lucifer has to be worse than seeing and hearing Cas everywhere. He decides, somehow slightly comforted by the thought.

He slams the brakes when he thinks he sees Cas walking along the road, too vivid to ignore, but gone in a blink. He stares out the window for a whole stormy night, because for a blink of time, he swears Cas was standing right there. He crashes the car when he thinks he sees a bloody figure in a trench coat lying unconscious in the middle of the road. But the figure vanishes by the time he climbs out of the car, bleeding. The visions always disappear if he blinks hard enough.

Cas is in the dimension in between, not here. Dean has to remind himself of that, over and over again, when he tosses himself through another sleepless night, or stitches himself up after the crash, or fixes the car. He doesn't know if that brief meeting time in the seance has made everything easier or harder. Now that he knows where Cas is, how horrible that place is, but he still can't find him or get to him, it is not helping anything at all except for crushing his heart, like a bloody hand squeezing it tight before ripping it out from his chest.

The nightmares are getting worse too after that, like a dam in his brain has burst, flooding his mind with imagination he never has and never needs. In the rare times he dozes off, the dreams become increasingly vivid and disturbing. Always with Cas being hurt one way or another, in one place or another. He dreams of wings broken and burned, twisted and torn, feathers dropped and scattered everywhere, his body split into pieces, then put back wrong. But whatever shape he takes, the Cas in his dream still always, always holds that same pair of bright blue eyes, locked on Dean. So he would know, it is Cas that is being deformed in every imaginable way, but whatever the change, it is still him. He is still in that body, able to feel and sense everything. The pain, the brokenness, the disorientation. It only makes the vision a million times worse.

Unnerving. Horrifying. Even for him. Even after everything he's seen in his life.

Dean goes to a crossroads, and buries a box with his photo in it.

The demon shows up as a young pretty blonde.

Dean glances at her tiredly, eyes rimmed red, the demon blade hanging loosely in his right hand.

"Dean Winchester," the demon looks him up and down, grinning. "It's been a while. Last time you made a deal -- yourself for your little brother, what is it you want this time? Or rather, who is it you want to trade your life for?"

He swallows, hating it being so obvious.

"First thing first, can you reach other dimensions?"

"I might," The demon replies casually.

"This is a yes-or-no question, you son of a bitch. Can you or can you not?" Dean growls.

"And my answer is: I might." The demon doesn't flinch. "Now it's your turn, either you trust me, or you don't."

Dean deflates. "What do you want in return? Ten years?"

"That would be too good to be true, wouldn't it?" The demon smiles a cheap smile, clicking her tongue. "We both know Hell can't hold you, and as soon as your boyfriend is topside, he'd just fetch you out of there anyway."

Dean puffs. "Then what?"

"What about --" The demon makes a thoughtful gesture. "I get him out, then you jump in?"

"What?" Dean glares at her.

"Would be a lot more fun to watch, wouldn't it? Somewhere out of reach. Then we can all sit tight and wait to see how *he* deals with it and tears everything down to get to you, just like you are now."

As disgusting as the demon is, she's right, Dean realizes. He'd just be making Cas feel as awful as he is now. Just like that same sick feeling he got when he found out about Dad's deal with Yellow-Eyes. God knows what Cas would do to handle that kind of misery. The guy blasted open Purgatory once, he might tear the whole multidimension down if that's what it takes to find Dean -- hell, *he* wants to do that too, if only he weren't a powerless human. But Cas, Cas might actually can and he would.

"He'd smite your brain out first thing," Dean says.

The demon smirks. "Worth it. Pity you wouldn't be there to watch it or see how broken he'd be. Or maybe, I'll make sure he hears every bit of detail how you made the deal, just to crush that delicate angel heart. Then kill him permanently while he's grieving."

Dean growls, marching forward with the demon blade raised high. The demon takes a hurried step back, "Easy, tiger, there is still a terrifying little girl in here, you wouldn't hurt her, would you?"

Dean pauses, lowering the blade, but the killing look in his eyes doesn't recede. "I'll just tear your demonic ass from your human ass then."

The words slip out without a second thought, but the moment they reach his ears, they strike him like an awakening drumbeat, so loud that he startles himself and has to steady his step to not stumble.

*Separating the true form from the body.* Didn't Cas say his main problem was his true form being spliced into the body, that it's what made him giant and stuck in that in-between dimension? So what if there is a way to separate them for him, and put them back together right, like rebreaking a malunited bone for it to heal correctly after.

He eyes the demon in front of him, and has a better idea.

<br>

The Gas'n'Sip rings a small bell when the door is pushed open. The store is empty with only a girl in a leather jacket and brunette hair standing at the register, checking out some gum and snacks. She doesn't look up at the newcomer as the cashier hands her the change.

A man approaches her from behind, a blade jabbed against her back, hidden beneath his jacket. His voice low, "We need to talk."

Meg snorts a laugh, not bothering to look back. "Dean. Nice to see you too. Aren't you going to buy me dinner first?"

"Sure, the drink will be holy water." Dean's tone is flat, "Now, walk."

They end up stopping by a deserted factory.

"I gotta ask, Dean, how'd you even find me?" Meg asks, genuinely curious. "Thought I was laying low enough."

"A little bird told me," Dean deadpans.

"You mean you tortured a demon." Meg reads his blank face. "Just to find me? You really know how to flatter a girl."

Dean ignores her. "What do you know about the angel-expelling spell?"

"Angelic exorcism? Why, trouble in paradise?" Meg looks truly intrigued now. "Cas piss you off so bad you're gonna banish him to Heaven? That's surely more fascinating than any Saturday night soap opera."

"Not like that." The thought of Cas leaving for Heaven makes his stomach twist. Dean shifts his feet.

"Care to elaborate?" Meg raises an eyebrow.

"Not your business," Dean bites out. "Now, the spell." He waves the demon blade in a way that makes his point clear.

"Fine," Meg looks away, dropping the smile. "I picked up a thing or two during my time with Yellow-Eyes. Azazel never used it, but Alastair couldn't shut up about it. I wasn't there but I heard he really enjoyed trying the spell on a certain angel when they first walked the Earth after two thousand years, not long before he got burned clean once and for all."

Dean looks at her intensely. "Which angel did he use it on?" The memory of the day Alastair died was still all too clear. That was also the devastating day of knowing he was the one jump started the apocalypse, the day Sam killed the demon with his damn mind.

"Our beloved Castiel, of course," Meg answers lightly.

Dean feels sick. But he remembers Cas was still there, when he woke up from that beating in the hospital. He'd been too caught up in his own thoughts to check him properly, but now that he thinks back, Cas might've looked a little pale but he was okay. At least Cas was still there by his bedside, which means either the spell wasn't finished, or he got banished back to Heaven but came back unharmed.

"Just, tell me the words." He tries hard to push away the image of Alastair putting his dirty demon hand on Cas's throat, chanting the angel exorcism spell. Cas's eyes would probably glow bright and white, his grace would fly skyward until he reaches Heaven, if Heaven'd still take him in. He can't imagine how the first apocalypse would have ended if Cas hadn't been there for him.

"*Omnipotentis Dei potestatem invoco! Ab orbe terra, Hunc angelum omne obsequendum! Domine expuet, Ut Deum ad empyreum remittat!*" Meg recites the Latin verses.

Dean memorizes the whole thing. He tries not to think about the fact he is just about to do the same thing to Cas that Alastair did before.

"Any side effects I need to know about?" Dean asks.

Meg shrugs slightly. "From the spell? No." She pauses there, leaving something unsaid hanging in the air.

"What?" Dean stares at her clear hesitance, demanding.

"But whatever you're about to do, I'm sure it's gonna end ugly," Meg says, not unkindly, just stating the obvious. "That's just how things with you Winchesters always go. You sure you don't want to tell me the whole story? Have you ever considered, *maybe* I can help?"

"What do you care? You are a demon." Dean frowns.

"That hurts my feelings, Dean. In case you haven't noticed, I do care," Meg raises her voice exaggeratedly, "and I've been good to you."

"You've been good to *you*," Dean retorts.

"Wouldn't have done that 'bursting into the Death Star through the front door so you and the angel could find Dick Roman' move if it's just *me* I'm caring, would I?" Meg shoots back. "And don't forget, when I took care of Cas for months when he lost his noodle, where were you?"

Dean swallows uneasily. He meets Meg's eyes, the unsaid obvious thing swirling in there, deep and shiny. Meg raises her eyebrows in challenge.

So he tells her.

Not everything, not much details, but enough for her to get some idea: the Purgatory, the dimension in between, the deformation. "So, all the fun things," she concludes. She's been listening quietly without interruption.

Dean talks more than he can remember he has in months. For a brief moment, it feels good. It feels easy. He even feels... understood, as if of all the people in the whole world, somehow, *Meg* is the one who knows what he's talking about. It surprises him.

He leaves out the parts with the djinns and the nightmares.

Meg bites her lip when Dean stops talking, deep in thought.

Dean watches her face. "Spit it out."

Meg shoots him a look. "Why am I not surprised you managed to break him and lose him *again*? Bravo."

Dean turns, ready to leave. "Okay, that's enough, I don't need anyone making me feel shittier than I already do."

"But I get it." Her voice behind his back says, gentler. "That plan of yours, it might actually work."

Dean spins back. "You think?"

Meg nods, not in any joking tone anymore. "I know. Angels are more like demons than humans in a way, so call me a professional in that. We need to possess bodies to walk the Earth, so do they. But banishing from the body and summoning him back, it's like pulling a heart out of a chest and shoving it back in before it stops beating. You miss the timing, you're stuck with a corpse."

Dean swallows again, forcing a light voice. "Guess I'll just have to time it right then, no problem."

"A million things could go wrong," Meg says, "but I admire you humans' blind hope. There is another catch."

Dean sighs. "Of course there is."

"You'll probably die." Meg tells him, flatly. "And knowing it's you, I wouldn't bother with the 'probably,' you are definitely going to die."

Dean narrows his eyes. "I didn't see that in the fine print of the spell."

"Oh, not the spell. Assuming Cas is saved, blah blah, happy reunion. But you forget about that tear." Meg meets his gaze. "You haven't really thought about how to fix a dimension, have you?"

Dean falls quiet. Then, "What's that gotta do with my death?"

"Everything." Meg takes a breath, as if what she's about to say next is a big thing even for her. "Because death is an infinite vessel."

Dean raises his eyebrows in question.

"From what you said, the tear makes everything on the edge infinite. It touches one snowflake and becomes the biggest snowstorm; touches one bird and becomes countless killer birds --"

"The *Infinity Mirror Effect*," Dean murmurs in realization. "Cas told me about it, but I didn't really understand what that means."

And now he does, loud and clear. An infinite vessel to contain the infinite disasters that fall through, a patch for the tear that keeps dragging Cas away, pulling him back into that painful dark dimension. Death, being the ultimate solution to the rule of physics. Somehow, he can almost see the beauty in it.

The solution to bringing Cas home.

"I'll do it," Dean says, a small smile starting to form on his lips. The first real smile in months, maybe years.

"I know you will." Meg nods once, holds out a hand as if trying to pat him on the shoulder, but pulls it back on second thought before touching.

"Thanks, I guess," she says instead.

Dean doesn't ask what for.
