Some credits, references, and inspirations. Some Easter eggs that were quite enjoyable to smuggle in.

**Chap. 2 "Into the Woods"**:

The legends of the giant fish and bird mentioned by Artemis: Quoted and translated from Zhuangzi's article "[Free and Easy Wandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book))" (庄周《逍遥游》), written around 300 BC. So the legend is indeed from over two thousand years ago. The first paragraph in original text goes like this: "北冥有鱼，其名为鲲。鲲之大，不知其几千里也；化而为鸟，其名为鹏。鹏之背，不知其几千里也，怒而飞，其翼若垂天之云。" I put these words in Artemis's mouth. I've loved the story of this giant fish turning into the giant bird [Peng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_(mythology)) so much ever since the first time I learned it in school. So when I needed an ancient myth about a big bird, this is the first thing popped into my mind.

How does Dean know the names of trees, plants, creatures, and birds: Apparently Cas has dragged him to watch the Nature Channel together more than once, and he actually paid attention, and secretly enjoys a lot but still pretends to groan and complain at every chance. Especially the bird part, he doesn't even realize he has a thing for them until much later. And here, when he's in the woods, he realizes he does memorize a lot of things and names he watched which is life-savingly useful, while thinking about Cas's wings. But still, even when they were watching the channel together and when he was definitely thinking about Cas's wings, he never really asked, so he never know Cas's wings' true color or how many pairs he has. Maybe there should be an epilogue, a timestamp, of them watching bird documentaries together or go back to Redwood again with Cas guiding and introducing the creatures and plants properly. And Cas might get surprised and impressed by Dean's knowledge.

**Chap. 3 "Amid the Tears"**:

"Something from the angel as the medium, the things he recognizes as his, to guide him to the call": The medium is not the trench coat or feather, it's Dean's body warmth left on them, it's Dean. It's always Dean.

Dean looks at the painted eye on Missouri's round table for seance and immediately starts staring at it: From Dean's view, it looks like Cas's eyes; from Cas's view, it's also what Dean looks like when only the "eyes of his mind" travel into the dimension in between. He has no body but only a big floating green eye, so it's also a very bizarre scene, disturbing even. Cas would have commented but never really got the chance to say that line or show more from his point of view.

**Chap. 4 "At the World's End"**:

"Does he dream about Purgatory when he's outside, or does he dream about outside when he's still in Purgatory": It might be a stretch to mention, but it's inspired somewhat by another ancient Chinese article of Zhuangzi's "[The Butterfly Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)#%22The_Butterfly_Dream%22)" (庄周梦蝶). The story is about Zhuangzi dreaming he was a butterfly and wondering if he was really Zhuangzi dreaming of being a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi. The confusion between inside and outside of dream world, it fascinated me for decades, and still does. So that djinn world storyline plays with that idea a bit.

The joke Amelia whispers into Sam's ear that cracks his laughter is: "I hope you won't name our kid 'Kid'."

Meg leaves a note saying Alaska is the World's End: In the design, Alaska is not the only end. There are other ends, anywhere that feels like you can't go any farther can be an "end." If that torn scrap were larger, Meg would have added another line there: "Try Ushuaia or Iceland if you like, but figured Alaska is the closest to you."

**Chap. 6 "Inside My Mind"**:

The quoting texts about cat biology in Cas's knowledge library: Quoted from Wikipedia.

The vast memories of a long-lived being, and the infinite possibilities of the future, enough to fill an infinite hole: Inspired by Doctor Who S07E07 "The Rings of Akhaten," one of my favorite episodes.

The unexpected nuclear reaction making the light and energy surge, to regenerate exponentially: It's triggered when Cas's grace and Dean's soul touch, they're like two halves of a nuclear core. The moment they connect, the reaction begins. They initially think it might be a chemical reaction, but it's far stronger than chemical-level. It's nuclear. Their bond is nuclear. Down to every atom and photon.

The memories and apologies and forgiveness and kisses inside the mind: They are parallel to the body-fixing process on the outside, and absolutely necessary in order to repair Cas's malform sequelae from the tear, to make him whole and help him remain stable in this dimension again. They think it's unexpected, but it's all an essential part of the fixing. Because, the dimension in between doesn't only shred and mess up Cas's body and form on the outside, not just the splicing of true form and vessel, but also inside the mind. As Dean realized earlier, the angelic memories and the screwed-up psychological knots and the deeply human emotions, those are shattered, jumbled, and in need of healing too. So they go through that fixing process in parallel, even if neither of them fully realizes or understands the necessity during the process at the time. They think they are simply handling the situation, facing another challenge as usual, holding on to each other at difficult times, trying to understand and support each other -- which is exactly what healing and fixing all about. (It isn't in the original writing outline, but it comes naturally. So it's not something the writer-god decided for them, they choose the path and go through the process by themselves.)

Why all the physics theories trying so hard to hopefully explain the supernatural situations: That part goes viral and out of control totally on its own. The very initial design was only to provide a quick explanation for why Cas becomes so giant, and then suddenly all the quantum mechanics and physics knowledge kicked in, and there was no stopping it. It is funny to imagine that Cas must be familiar with all the modern mathematics and physics, considering there are more than one occurrences in canon where he says things like "I can draw a diagram to explain this" or "write a series of partial differential equations to explain that". It wouldn't be a surprise if all those things we humans (and hunters) consider supernatural (especially the parts involving time and space and dimension) are only incomprehensible because we haven't discovered the science behind them, but angels know. Pretty sure the writers didn't see quantum physics playing a role when they wrote the line "multidimensional wavelength celestial being." Not even I came to think about Mass-Energy Equivalence until writing the last chapter, and then the world-ending crisis just solved itself. It has been so much fun to explore a difficult situation with no humanoid enemy to fight or negotiate with, only the natural order and the laws of physics. Only the reality of the world itself.

This is the second time in a row I've written a story where basically "love saves the world". Probably should stop doing that. Or not.
