## Idea

(**S15E18/20 Jack made deal with Empty to save Cas, destiel save Jack**)

Jack had to make a deal with Empty to bring Cas back, because God has no power in Empty. That's why he's not as strong as he should be as God after that, that's why he couldn't and didn't bring Cas to Dean after he saved Cas, even if he knew perfectly well how important Cas is to Dean and vice versa and wouldn't keep Deann miserable for five years alone.

The deal ripped Jack off his feelings and emotions. (Jack hesitated, Empty: "You think your feelings and emotions are more important than Castiel? You can leave him here sleep forever then, keep your little feelings." So Jack did it.)

He's become cold and distant, not evil, just neutral, stop caring, kinda like soulless time. Cas comes back as Angel and has to live in Heaven, because Jack made a new rule, no angel is allowed to go to Earth again, not even Cas is allowed, not even when Cas heard Dean pray to him. Cas tries to tell Jack he has to go, Jack doesn't get touched by feelings or his reasoning, that's when Cas notices Jack is off, the old Jack would understand.

So Cas breaks Jack's (new God's) rule (he's always the angel that breaks the rule, whoever's rule it is, be it Chuck or Jack as God), and sneaks down to Earth to reach out to Dean, let Dean know he's still alive but they have God problem again, but not to kill him, but to save him. Cas asks for Dean's help to save Jack, let him have feeling again, showing him feelings and love.

In the end it must be how Jack sees the love between them and get changed again, made him feel again. Jack becomes the old Jack.

In between the saving, because Jack would do what he thinks is the right thing to do, and since Cas does break his explicit rule to go down to the Earth, he'd punish Cas by locking him up. So briefly after seeing Cas again, Dean loses him again, has to figure out a way to figure out he's locked down and has to go up there to bust him out of Heaven jail and two of them save Jack together. (in order to go to Heaven, Dean might have to die again. temporary MCD unavoidable, but in the end, after Jack comes back, he can send them both back down to Earth to continue living)



(**what if God!Jack turn bad**)

"Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely."

we're glad Jack is good for now so we're okay with him becoming God, but that's still a lot and absolute power, and given time, with that much power, he might potentially still turn bad

what if by that time Dean/Sam already in heaven, Cas as angel is assisting God!Jack and notice things are off, he has enough morality to notice some decisions are turning grey (even if Jack says he's gonna be hand off, gradually slightly he'd still be involved, so there always will be some decisions need made, always some chance to be grey/black)

Cas goes to Dean/Sam in heaven about the issue, but this time not like Chuck, they can't kill Jack, he's their son still, no matter what, they need to find a way

there should be a way to build the system without god, or make a balance; like a democratic system of god's decision? all of them vote to make mutual decision to function as god? God is not single deity but a collateral term of many wise minds? there are other wise rulers in Heaven, invite them to rule as God?

## Title

**The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit**

Christian trinity

the father: God is the father, God!Jack is considered the "father" of the creation; Cas and Dean are Jack's father, mostly Cas

the son: the creation is the son; Jack is their son, God the son needs their saving

the holy spirit: their unity and love, all the love between the three of them (Jack loves Cas so self-sacrifice to save him, loves Dean so he brings back Cas for him *again*; Cas loves Dean and Jack; Dean loves Cas and Jack)

so basically the title = "Cas, Jack, and Dean", but also cleverly reusing the trinity, all three can mean God, and God is Jack. double meaning

## Outline

(compliant with S15E20, Dean is in Heaven, Jack brings Cas back, Cas helps Jack rebuilding Heaven)

(mainly Dean & Cas POV, very occasionally Jack POV, very little Bobby POV)

(after-deal Jack ≈ soulless Sam & soulless Jack, but more powerful, more cold, more dark)

Cas comes back alive in Heaven, full-powered. Heaven is half-way rebuilding, Jack is alone on the rebuilding work. Cas reunites with Jack, very happy and hugs him, Jack hugs back, but a bit somewhat cold and distant (not evil, just neutral, stop caring as much, and will care less and less). Cas notices a bit off but can't quite tell yet, just ask if Jack is okay, Jack tasks him with rebuilding Heaven (doesn't tell him about the deal). Cas asks about Dean, wants to go down to let him know he's back and okay so Dean wouldn't have to worry. Jack doesn't let him, maybe find some reason to busy him with, or just tell him there should be new rule in this world now, angels shouldn't walk the Earth ("Earth was reasonably fine in the two thousand years when no angel set foot, and it was messed up terribly in the last twenty years." so no angel should go down there.) Cas might want to argue, they might have a little bit debate/fight, Jack might pull the God role on him for the first time to ask him to obey and stay only on Heaven, going down to Earth would have punishment, not even Cas is allowed. Cas might obey verbally but that's how he knows things are wrong, the old Jack would never do that and would understand, he's already worried about what's wrong about Jack and really wants to reach to Dean.

Cas hears Dean's prayer, Dean on earth yearns for Cas to come back, reciprocates (a bit Dean POV here, normal daily case time, Dean cleans up Cas's room and sees his mixtape etc., Dean crying for Cas). Cas ignores Jack's order, sneaks to the Heaven's gate, realizes all the doors are guarded. The guarding angels beg him not to make more trouble than he used to, or they'd let Jack know. Cas goes back torn and aching (can still hear Dean's prayer all the time, and time passes faster on Earth, days/months passed just when he's moving around). Cas goes to Bobby asking for advice/help (a bit reunion scene between Cas/Bobby, mutual update each other's status, Cas tells Bobby he's the one help rebuilding his part of Heaven, Cas maybe rebuilds it just as they speak). Cas expresses his concern for Jack, wants to go to Dean but doesn't want to have conflict with Jack, doesn't want to cause any trouble again to Heaven. Bobby suggests him to follow his own heart (be it to reason with Jack again or go to Dean against order, it's a Jack or Dean situation for Cas), it's his decision.

Cas half-heartedly continues rebuilding this part of the Heaven and realizes he's been duplicating what's exactly on Earth, the whole states are mapped back to Heaven, and he wanders a beachside. He magics some cabins and starts decorating and finetuning/polishing them, adding a bit more details just as he remembers, include a bar that's like Dean's ideal dream place Rocky's Bar (short, passing lines). Jack comes by asking what he's building, Cas: "Home." Cas wants Jack to know some of these is for him too, Jack doesn't feel/understand it, Cas tries to reason with Jack again about the feeling/home/family concept, wants to ask for permission to go to Dean. Jack denies again and flies away. (end scene with fight, Jack: "I don't want to hear that again.")

Cas hears Dean's 1520 ultimate dying prayer, he desperately goes to Dean, tries his best fighting off the gate-guarding angels, he really really has to go to Dean. (he's always the angel that breaks the rule, whoever's rule it is, be it Chuck or Jack as God) It's too important, he's never let Dean down, he's always there when Dean asks him, he *has to* be there to save him, or Dean would die. Cas's really desperate and getting more and more violent and impatient with the struggling fight. The other angels can't stop him. But then Jack shows up. Cas desperately tries to persuade him to let him go to Dean to save him, Cas would cry to beg, it's breaking his heart. Jack doesn't get touched by feelings or his reasoning, even if he hears him (Jack: "It's okay, he'll come here soon" Dean will have peace and everything will be okay. and it's natural order, Jack genuinely thinks it's something no one should interfere again, they should just let it happen, it's also what Dean would want too.) Cas is absolutely heartbroken, wrecked, rarely raged, knowing it means Dean would die and die thinking Cas is in Empty and Cas can't do anything about it. Cas fights against Jack a bit harder than usual, just trying to go through the gate (maybe verbally less respectful, maybe even tries "I'm your father" or "Dean's your father"). Jack maybe also gets a bit angry (or still cold, "No, you're not." or "He's not really."), constrains Cas, throwing him to the Heaven jail (because Jack does what he thinks is the right thing to do and Cas does break his explicit rule, it's for creating the new rule, it's for the world/universe's sake, to Cas: "I hope you'll understand one day. Rules have reasons to exist. If there's no rule, there's nothing.").

Dean dies, goes to Heaven ("At least I made it"), meets Bobby. Bobby lets him know Cas is here too. Dean relieved, Bobby thinks that means Cas doesn't get to meet Dean on the Earth, so Cas must be following Jack's rule. Dean wants where to find Cas, Bobby suggests him take a ride, Cas must come when he hears him calling him. Dean drives and prays and waits, finds the bar and cabin, knows only two people in the world know about Rocky's Bar and Sam is not the one here. Dean waits for Cas at Rocky's, prepares it some more for reunion, a bit nervous and happy and expecting, prays and prays and waits and waits but Cas doesn't come. (a bit intercut with Cas in jail and hears the prayer, knows Dean's already in Heaven, means he's really dead, Cas desperately tries to get out of the jail but can't, Cas heartbroken). Dean prays for Jack instead, Jack comes (a bit reunion scene, Dean hugs Jack, "Good to say. Heard from Bobby you helped bring Cas back" "Where is he?" Jack: "Jail." Dean: "What?" Jack explains nonchalantly), Dean tries to reason with Jack, Jack warns him about Heaven's new rule, not even them should break it this time, it's better for everyone, and leaves.

Dean goes back to let Bobby know something wrong with Jack, Bobby rephrases Cas's concern. They'll have to figure out what happened to Jack, but needs to find/save Cas first. (preparation: handmake tracker/gun/earbuds, they have the tools, they can still create things like Ash did.) Dean/Bobby search the part of Heaven they have access to but can't find (still pocket universe), run into the edge of the pocket universe and meet gate-guardian angels, Dean deliberately shows violence and as if tries to bridge the gate to go down to Earth (actually cover for Bobby), the angels arrest Dean and throw him into Heaven's jail, next to Cas.

Dean/Cas reunion scene, reciprocate, mutual confession. Cas regrets not save Dean this time, Dean comforts him it's okay. both worry about Jack, will have to figure out what's wrong and save him once they're out. Dean communicates with Bobby about location, Cas guides Bobby through how to open cell from outside (Bobby actually familiar with jail structure), blasts jail guardian angels away. Three of them escape jail, go back to Rocky's Bar as base.

They discuss plan of how to save Jack. (They have God problem again, but this time unlike Chuck, not to kill him, but to save him. they can's kill Jack, he's still their son, no matter what, they need to find a way.) Dean might suggest they might have to prepare themselves for the worst, just in case Jack becomes the second Chuck, they might have to rid him of God power like they did to Chuck or lock him up in MoC. Cas furious, they have a bit fight, Dean frustrated (because he's being reasonable), Cas roars "He's my son!" Dean: "You don't think he's mine too?" Cas surprised, taken aback, he does think Dean doesn't think of Jack so much that way. Dean/Cas get back well, look for ways. Cas suggests Dean kill him so he can go to Empty to investigate what's wrong, Dean red-rimmed-eyed refuses. Cas: "I'd do anything to save Jack" Dean: "Not if it costs you" They argue hard, Jack comes.

Dean/Cas stop fighting, a bit panicked and unsure about Jack's attitude, Jack accuses them break rule and bust out of jail. Dean/Cas both fight for responsibility ("It's my fault" "No, it's mine"), hoping to take the blame so the other wouldn't be thrown to jail again. Jack is a little moved by their willingness to sacrifice for the other, shift a bit from previous coldness, saying it would be pointless of his sacrifice to save him if Cas is to go back to Empty again. Dean asks what happened in the Empty, what did it cost Jack to save Cas. Jack tells them the truth.

Jack had to make a deal with Empty to bring Cas back, because God has no power in Empty. That's why he's not as strong & compassionate as he should be as God (destiel doesn't realize until a while later), that's why he couldn't and didn't bring Cas to Dean after he saved Cas, even if he knew perfectly well how important Cas is to Dean and vice versa and wouldn't keep Dean miserable for five years alone (include a reunion scene and a confrontation scene, they appreciate the reunion but question why not earlier)

The deal ripped Jack off his feelings and emotions, and a great part of his power. (Jack hesitated, Empty: "You think these are more important than Castiel? You can leave him here sleep forever then, keep your little pathetic feelings and power with you, knowing you have this chance once and you didn't take it. Imagine what Dean would say to you if he knows one day." Jack wants to consult Dean before making the deal, a little torn, know deal is bad, know Cas had made deal for him and Dean isn't happy, already imagining Dean yelling at him, remembering S13 beginning how painful Dean is for missing Cas and angry at him; Empty doesn't let him, this offer is once and only, if he left now, it would never make the same offer again; Empty lets him see sleeping Cas but doesn't let Jack talk to Cas either, maybe even torture Cas in front of him just to pressure Jack, show Jack Empty can do anything to Cas and no one can stop; Jack wants to deal for more than just Cas, wants to bring Gabe and Crowley back too, Empty asks for more to bargain or just simply deny, Jack has to compromise and eventually agree the deal)

So now Dean/Cas know the key is to let Jack has feeling again, show him feelings and love. Cas hugs Jack, Dean hugs both of them. They keep talking, evoking memories of past events, keep asking Jack when something happened, how did he feel (those events all related to Cas and Dean). some might be hypothetical, let Jack imagine Cas or Dean dead, or something similar. all of them pained at imagination, Cas/Dean pass their feelings (both to each other and their caring for Jack) to Jack. Bobby POV, see Cas's grace and Dean's soul pass light to Jack, embrace Jack. Jack's eyes turn gold, he can feel feelings and love again (his feeling and care for Dean/Cas, Dean/Cas's love for each other and the world, so he knows to love the world too; a lot of flashback visuals), it's like their combined grace-soul fulfills his missing soul and becomes full again. Jack eventually tells them he loves them, they know old Jack is back. All of them hug and cry and relieved and happy.

From the experience, Jack raises concern he shouldn't be the one making sole decisions and rules, just in case his judgement goes wrong. Dean suggests he can consult them, they can make decision together. Cas/Bobby suggest one more step further, they can make democratic system. So they make decision: The monarch God system isn't good, they'll change toward a democratic god system. the power might be mostly still centralized on Jack, but the decision of what to do and what to help or not help would be up to the committee ("Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely", he's only 2 years old, he doesn't trust his own decision), God shouldn't be a single deity but a collateral term of many wise minds. Dean/Cas/Bobby be the first members in the committee, but even they know they can't always trust their judgement, they've made so many mistakes before. Cas suggesting there are so many wise people in the history that end up in Heaven, why not include their opinions. (Jack eyes bright: "I know exactly who to invite" Dean: "I'll prepare the booze -- are they all okay with a little alcohol party?" Cas: "Not Gandhi, but Lincoln accepts it, he's particularly fond of Applejack." "And Martin Luther King?" "Orange juice and vodka" "So a Screwdriver. Noted.")

Hopeful happy ending. (Before the ending, Jack asks if Dean/Cas want to go to Earth. Dean might do, Cas asks what Jack wants, Jack wants them stay, so they stay.)
