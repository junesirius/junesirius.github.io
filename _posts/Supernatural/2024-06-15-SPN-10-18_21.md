> Metatron: (blablabla unimportant)
>
> Castiel pulls out his cell phone and makes a call. Interior of the Men of Letter's Library. Sam is at a laptop and answers his cell phone.
>
> Sam: Cass?
>
> Castiel: (in his car) <u>Can I just kill him now?</u>
>
> Metatron: <u>You know I can hear you, right?</u>
>
> Sam: No, we need him alive for now. Look, after he gives you your Grace back, you can do whatever you want with him.
>
> Castiel: <u>Well, I'd like to kill him slowly.</u>
>
> Metatron: <u>I am like two feet from you.</u>
>
> Castiel: Anything on the Mark of Cain?
>
> Metatron: Every word -- crystal clear.
>
> Sam: No. I mean, I've been digging for something, for anything, but... I don't know Cass.
>
> Castiel: There is an answer out there. We will find a cure for Dean.
>
> Metatron: I don't know why you'd want to cure that little firecracker now. He's finally interest... <u>(Castiel punches Metatron in the face) Ooh!</u>
>
> Castiel: Well, just keep digging.
>
> Sam: (Sam looks up and Dean is entering the library.) Yeah, uh, no one here by that name. Sorry. (Sam hangs up.)
>
> Castiel: Sam?
>
> Metatron: Lose reception? Or did he hang up on you? <u>(Castiel turns and looks at Metatron. Metatron begins laughing.) He hung up on you, didn't he? (Castiel punches Metatron in the face again.) Ooh!</u>

> Interior of a diner. Castiel and Metatron are at a table. Metatron is eating waffles with whipped cream, strawberries, and blueberries on top.
>
> Metatron: Mmmmmm! O... M... Me! Oh. Food. Glorious Food. Mmm. All the countless descriptions in so many books, but those are just words. Oh, the taste, the -- the actual taste... I had no idea. Oh. And the process. Goes in here (he points to his mouth)... comes out here (points toward his rear). Sorcery. I mean, <u>you used to be human. Don't you miss all this?</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>No. I don't miss digestion. I don't miss indigestion.</u>
>
> Metatron: No, no, no. Not that. I mean, don't you miss the feeling of all this? Like the taste of these waffles. The sound of a child's laughter. Look at us. We're a couple of angels <u>who've touched not only the divine, but the mundane.</u> You and I have a lot in common.
>
> Castiel: Don't.

> Castiel: Now we've hit three of your so-called safe houses, and all of them are empty. So either you've lost my Grace or you're stalling.
>
> Metatron: Can you blame me? The minute I hand over your Grace, I'm dead.
>
> Castiel: You have made your bed, Metatron, and nothing is going to get you out of it.

> The Angry Cupid tries to strike Castiel with his angel blade. They fight. <u>He goes to stab Metatron with his blade and Castiel knocks him down</u> and he drops his angel blade and they both fall. The Angry Cupid gets Castiel's blade away from him and is about to stab Castiel. Metatron stabs him in the back with the angel blade he had dropped. <u>Castiel picks up his angel blade and Metatron hands Castiel the Angry Cupid's blade.</u>
>
> Metatron: I owed you that one, anyway.
>
> Castiel: This changes nothing. (Castiel gets up and walks toward his car with both angel blades.)
>
> Metatron: You're welcome.

> Metatron: I told the angel to hide some clues in some of my favorite books. (He holds up his handcuffed wrists.) Mother, may I? (He limps over to a shelf and pulls out a book. Castiel takes the book and opens it and removes a note.)
>
> Castiel: <u>"What is the maddest thing a man can do?"</u> It's a riddle? What -- what's the answer?

> Metatron: All right... First things first -- find what I really came here for. (He takes a note out of the book and reads it.) <u>"What two things do you need to succeed in life?" Ignorance and confidence.</u>

> Castiel looks at the note from the first book.
>
> Castiel: They're quotes.
>
> Castiel is crawling down another aisle looking for a book. Castiel grabs at "Don Quixote" by Miguel Cervantes and knocks it off the shelf. The container with his Grace falls out of the book.
>
> Castiel: (Opens the container with his Grace.) <u>What's the maddest thing a man can do? Let himself die.</u> (Castiel inhales his Grace. He stands up and has his full power back.)

> The door opens and Charlie enters carrying two plastic bags. She heads down the stairs.
>
> Charlie: We're back, bitches! (She suddenly sees Castiel.) <u>Whoa! Is that who I think it is?</u>
>
> Sam: <u>Charlie, Cass. Cass, Charlie. (Charlie hugs Cass.)</u>
>
> Charlie: <u>I thought you'd be shorter.</u> (She puts the bags on the table. Sam grabs the bags.)
>
> Sam: I'm gonna get these to the fridge.
>
> Charlie: <u>Heard you got your mojo back.</u>
>
> Castiel: Yes, my -- my Grace, it's -- it's been restored.
>
> Charlie: So, can't you just -- you know... cure Dean?
>
> Castiel: Unfortunately, it's not that simple.
>
> Charlie: Oh. Never is, is it? <u>Do you think you could do anything about my carpal tunnel? (Castiel places two fingers on Charlie's forehead.) Is that it?</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Your carpal tunnel and your bullet wound are now healed. You may want to continue wearing your wrist brace at night, though.</u>
>
> Charlie: <u>Did we just become best friends?</u>

> Charlie: Cass. Are you in on this, too?
>
> Rowena: Hell's bells. More distractions? What are you? Witch or nerd?
>
> Castiel: Angel.
>
> Rowena: Beg pardon?
>
> Sam: Castiel has, uh, powers... spiritual muscle that'll help safeguard the work.
>
> Rowena: Safeguard it from what?
>
> Sam: You. I can't be here full time to referee.
>
> Castiel: <u>Whoa, whoa. And I can?</u>
>
> Sam: <u>Yes. Please. Please do this for me.</u>
>
> Castiel: Well, what are the rules? If I'm gonna referee, I should at least know them.
>
> Rowena: Quite literal, aren't you? Does he know that the first rule is don't tell your brother what we're doing?
>
> Castiel: Wait... Dean doesn't know? Sam, this never ends well.
>
> Charlie: That's exactly what I said.
>
> Sam: Okay, everyone take a breath. Look, we're up against it, okay? And we've all been up against it before, and we know there are times when every choice sucks. Now, us... lying to Dean... is the choice that sucks the least. We have to make this work. Please.
>
> Charlie: <u>Okay, yeah. For Dean.</u>
>
> Sam: Cass?
>
> Castiel: <u>Okay. For Dean.</u>
>
> Sam: <u>For Dean.</u>
>
> Rowena: <u>I barely know the man.</u>

> Dean wanders into the library where Sam's phone is vibrating. Dean answers when he sees that it's Castiel calling. This scene flips back and forth between Dean and Cass while they're on the phone, and ends with Sam and Dean talking about dinner.
>
> Dean: Cass?
>
> Castiel: Sam.
>
> Dean: No, it's Dean. What's up?
>
> Castiel: <u>Nothing. I'm just, uh... Just staying in touch. Like I do.</u>
>
> Dean: Something on your mind?
>
> Castiel: <u>No. This call is pointless. My ride's here. (Cass hangs up on Dean.)</u>

> Charlie: <u>I am doing my best, but with her criticizing, breathing down my neck, trying to sign me up for team witch... oh, oh, and moaning how the one good year for music was 1723... I... I am going crazy. I know. No, I mean, she is evil.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>She is a wicked witch, so by definition...</u>
>
> Charlie: <u>No, no, no, I mean something bad is gonna happen here. Castiel, man, just spring me for two hours, one hour... anyplace quiet. Dean is my buddy, and I cannot screw this up, but... but my mind is... is... it's a wad of gummy worms. Please.</u>
