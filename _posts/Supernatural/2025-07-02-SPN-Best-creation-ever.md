(Summary: When the first pie is created.)

<br>

The Impala pulls up to the side of the street. Stop signs mark the rest of the road occupied. Pedestrians crowd the place, walking around parked cars toward the closed zone, moving in every directions. The sun shines brightly, the air warm and cozy.

Dean steps out of the car, eyes dead serious ahead.

Cas follows him off the passenger seat, regarding him closely. "Dean, are you sure you're ready for this?"

Dean shoots him a quick glance, returning his attention to the world before him. "Are you kidding me? Cas, I have no choice. This is my destiny."

A wide grin crawls its way onto his face, as Dean walks straight into the pedestrian zone. The floating banner over his head reads: "43rd Annual Akron Pie Fest."

The air smells sugary and the fragrant of fresh bakery. Dean is practically rushing toward the closest stand, not caring if he might knock someone down on his way.

Cas can't hold back a small smile, keeping up with him, waiting together for the slow line moving toward to the tray full of treasure -- the classic apple pie.

Dean picks the largest paper tray they have, and start filling it with all the delicious pieces. Cas has to remind him not to take more than one piece of each kind, just to try more of different flavors.

Dean pouts at the paper tray as if it betrayed him when it's full -- there are only half a dozen different pieces of pies, why can't it take more? Though his arm is already sore just by keeping the tray balanced while maneuvering among the crowd.

"That should be enough for a day, Dean," Cas glances at him, holding a hand to protect the pies from the side, just in case someone knocking it over.

"There is no 'enough' for pie, not for one day, not ever." Dean protests with a straight face.

Cas sighs, taking over the tray for him, nodding at a new stand with a sign saying "the pie you've never tried before," and tells him, "Alright, I'll hold this for you, why don't you go get another one? Hopefully that can take everything you want."

Dean beams at him with the largest smile as if seeing his personal Heaven standing right in front of him. "I know Jack brought you back for a reason." He bumps into Cas's shoulder fondly, and goes for the second tray as told.

They bring back all the pies Dean can manage to the car -- all the outdoor seats are occupied and by the look of those wooden tables and chairs, they'd be too sticky to sit anyway. They spread the pies on the front row seats between them.

The inside of the Impala smells of honey and cinnamon immediately.

Dean aims for a piece with banana and cream first, opens up his mouth as big as he can as if he's still in that Scooby Doo world, stuffs half the pie inside, and lets out a happy, satisfied sound. He indulges himself into the sea of taste bursting out on his tongue with closed eyes.

When he swallows the bite and licks the cream on his lips, Dean says, "Sam has no idea how much he missed."

"I'm sure he's also having a good time with Eileen." Cas responds.

"Don't think Ireland has these," Dean opens his eyes, gesturing with the remnants of the pie still in his hand, looking up at Cas, only to run into a pair of eyes intensely on his face, circling around his lips. He wipes the corner of his mouth carelessly.

Cas considers. "They have shepherd's pie." he reports factually.

"Not the same thing," Dean files his verdict, finishing up the pie in his mouth and eying for a second. "And not as good as these. Come on, don't just stare. Eat up. I ain't getting everything for myself."

Cas shifts his gaze to Dean's eyes, almost in surprise. "You're sharing?"

"Of course," Dean is almost offended by the question, "Why else would I take you with on this trip?"

Cas tilts his head, nodding to the tray he had been carrying earlier, with a small mischief curve at the tip of his mouth. "Oh, I thought it's to hold that for you when your hands are too busy."

Dean shoots him a glare in the middle of chewing his apple pie, not able to speak until he swallows the bite. "Shut up. Just, try them. They're good. Actually, they are the best pies ever."

Cas takes a small piece of pecan pie and takes a small bite on the pointy end, contemplating on the flavor.

Dean watches him, "Good? Still molecule?"

Cas puts the pie down with a small sigh. "Still molecule. Probably the only downside of having all my power back."

Dean nods in understanding, taking over the piece and starting to eat from the corner Cas has bit. "Things just can't be perfect, isn't it? We just can never get everything we want."

"They're actually not the best pie ever created," Cas tells him.

Dean narrows his eyes, slowly putting down his busy serving hand on its halfway sending the next piece to devour. "How do you know? You know where to find good ones and never told me?"

Castiel shifts his gaze away, eyes on the busy crowds and pie stands in small distance. "1991 BC, Egypt." He says, matter-of-factly.

Dean stares at him, forgetting to eat. "You're joking."

Cas looks back, meeting his stare with a sincere face. "No, I'm not."

"Four thousand years ago," Dean puts the half-eaten pie down, too distracted to continue now. "That can't possibly be right. Does the word 'pie' even exist? Wait, Egypt, they don't even speak English!"

"They were not called pie yet, but does a rose stop being pretty when it's not called rose?" Cas retorts.

Dean is muted for a second. "Fair. But how do you know? You just said you can't taste anything now."

Cas shifts slightly in the passenger seat, "That's what I heard. Do you want to go and validate if it's true?"

"Do I want --" Dean straightens his back, "Let me get this straight. Are you seriously asking if I want to time travel to *four thousand years ago* to see if a pie at that time is *THE best* pie in the whole world?"

Cas blinks, almost shyly, "Yes."

Dean grins widely, "Hell, yeah."

<br>

"This looks like a movie," Dean blinks hard under the over-bright desert sun, whispering in awe under his breath. He doesn't even dare to speak too loudly.

"Technically it's the movies that look like this," Cas says reasonably, "this comes earlier. It's the original, authentic Middle Kingdom of Egypt."

Dean looks around. The city is busy. The streets and houses aren't so different from a small modern city. Buildings that look about two stories tall standing steadily along the street, surrounded by beautifully carved pillars -- must be houses for riches, if Dean has to guess. Moving stalls with food and living stocks line by the road, surrounded by passers-by in plain dresses -- practically the very first version of food trucks.

No wonder ancient Egypt has always had a place in the history and lore -- look what they have two thousand years before Jesus! Even from Genesis's view, this city, this culture, is something really awesome.

He nudges Cas quietly, "Are we talking about biblical or archeological history here? This gotta be, what, before the Flood and shit like plague?"

Cas answers gently, "The difference between the two is actually smaller than you think. Exodus wouldn't happen in another five hundred years."

"Great," Dean murmurs, "was worried there for a second. Don't want to get caught in one of those big douchebag fights just on my way to get some nice pie."

"We wouldn't." Cas reassures him, "I checked, there is no angel in the city right now."

Dean nods in appreciation.

Some locals walk past them, glancing at them curiously. Dean looks down at himself, feeling more self conscious and out of place than ever.

He tucks the skirt of his flannel uneasily, "We gotta look like aliens." He mocks complaining, "You forget to mention we should get changed. You know, to blend in."

Cas regards their clothing briefly, walking over to one of the stalls with colorful flowery cloth, the lines and patterns shining as bright as the sun. Dean follows him confusingly.

Cas talks rapidly to the husky woman standing behind the stall in a language Dean has absolutely no idea what. His eyes shift between Cas and the woman, trying hard to look less dumb and follow the situation by reading their hand gestures -- Cas doesn't gesture much, so it's mostly the woman's.

She replies cheerfully to whatever Cas told her, eyes lingering between them, regarding Dean with a warm curiosity and interest then on Cas. Her hands gesture earnestly at the street, the cloth, the food stand next to her, then somewhere high and above, with a look of longing on her face. Cas listens to her carefully, supplying syllables in between her sentences, nodding and agreeing every now and then. Whatever that language is, Dean thinks, it comes out in Cas's voice and it's becoming one of the hottest languages in his head.

The woman shakes Cas's hand firmly at the end of the chat, handing two pieces of cloth on her stand to him, and holds out a hand to Dean as well. Dean glances at Cas once, taking her hand and shaking it. "Thank you," he says, offering a smile. Figure at least he gets this part now.

Cas translates for him, and the woman smiles wider and warmer, and finally lets them go.

Dean walks away from the stall, following Cas in the direction the woman pointed them to.

"That's total show off," he comments, "What was that? Old Arabic?"

"Middle Egyptian." Cas answers easily, "They won't start speaking Arabic until Arabs come."

Dean hums quietly, unwilling to show how limited his knowledge of ancient Egypt is, but Cas must know anyway. He eyes the beautiful cloth in Cas's hand, "Let me guess, you just sweet talked your way around and the woman just loved you so much she's willing to give you whatever you want without pay."

Cas blushes.

Dean widens his eyes, "Wait, really? What did you tell her?"

"That we're travelers from afar. We bring messages to the Pharaoh, but you are worried our dressing would be improper for the situation. And that we are hungry and thirsty." Cas tells him.

"Not wrong, though." Dean considers, "And what did you tell her about us? Don't say nothing, I know it's not nothing just by the way she looks at me after you said something."

Cas doesn't meet his eyes, just looking straight ahead. "There is no good word in Middle Egyptian," Cas says, "so I took the liberty of using the equivalent of 'partner'."

"*Partner*," Dean parrots, "as in partner in crime or...?"

"Something closer," Cas says vaguely, "I hope you don't mind."

"Oh," Dean says, then, "yeah I don't mind." He lets it slip.

<br>

The road they're walking on takes a small curve to the left then right. Dean can tell the approaching wealth just by the way the buildings on the roadside getting taller, wider, fancier. The carvings on the pillars and frames are delicate and complicate, the decorations shine golden. The men and women stepping in and out wear gorgeously.

Cas has wrapped those pieces of cloth so generously provided by that Egyptian woman on both of them, covering over the shoulder and arms. They still don't look remotely close to the locals, but at least not as jarring as if Jar jar Binks is walking into the town.

"Are we seriously going to meet the king?" Dean asks, figure "pharaoh" is just like a king.

"That's usually where all the best food is. So yes, it is the time Nile just flooded and the current pharaoh Mentuhotep IV is hosting a feast. We will invite ourselves in the feast, so you can try the best pie in the world." Cas states as if it's easy and obvious and nothing could possibly go wrong.

"And I'll just let you do all the talking, and focus on eating. Just let me know if some of one start yelling 'Run' or 'Fire'." Dean makes a face.

"Do you want to learn the language?" Cas stops his steps, turning to Dean.

"What? Like I can learn how to say 'Hello' and 'Thank you' in every language?" Dean stops in the middle of the road as well.

 "Like learning everything I know," Cas tabs two fingers on Dean's forehead. And Vola, he can hear the everyday chat on the street now, the customer standing in the closest stall is arguing the price of some spice, saying it might not be the real stuff, the two people further down are asking about one another' family member's health and life -- all in English.

"Holy," Dean gasps, taking a step automatically, trying to steady himself. Cas reaches a hand to hold him.

"It's like downloading a new language package." Dean understands the process now, doesn't mean he likes it.

"Now they can understand you too," Cas tells him patiently. "When you think you're saying English, they hear Egyptian."

Dean stills, "Am I speaking English or Egyptian now? Damn, does that mean I don't even get to hear myself speak those erotic things like you did back there."

"Nothing is perfect." Cas ducks his head. Meeting Dean's eyes, he quickly adds, "And don't worry, this is just a brief neurolink, giving you temporary language knowledge that I have. It will wear off soon. I just think it might be more convenient while we are here. And, um, you're speaking English, until next time your brain decides differently."

"How long of a 'temporary' are we talking about?" Dean can't help asking.

"A few days or weeks." Cas considers, "We don't usually do this, and the outcome reaction differs individually."

(outline: Cas time travels with Dean to when the first pie is made, got a everyday job in Egypt, like 10Rose in Rome, Anubis, Osiris.)

(After-work notes: Please be gentle on fact check on the history part, I've done a little research on pie's history and Egypt stuff, but that's about all I know. The rest gaps in knowledge are all fulfilled by pure imagination -- which means probably all full of random nonsense, just about anything works for a story.)

"Now I get it why some people bother fly halfway across Earth just to get a good taste."

"Do you want to come back again sometimes?"

"Why bother? I can just recreate it in our kitchen, innit?"
