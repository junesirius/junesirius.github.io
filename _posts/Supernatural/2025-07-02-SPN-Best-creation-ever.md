**Summary:**

"They're actually not the best pies ever created," Cas says.

Dean narrows his eyes. "You know where to find good ones and never told me?"

Castiel shifts his gaze away. "1991 BC, Egypt," he answers matter-of-factly, as if it's one of the simple most obvious unchangeable truths of the world.

Dean stares at him. "You're joking."

The Impala pulls up to the side of the street. Stop signs mark the rest of the road as occupied. Pedestrians crowd the place, walking around parked cars toward the closed zone, moving in every direction. The sun shines brightly, the air warm and cozy.

Dean steps out of the car, eyes dead serious ahead.

Cas follows him, leaving the passenger seat, regarding him closely. "Dean, are you sure you're ready for this?"

Dean shoots him a quick glance, returning his attention to the world before him. "Are you kidding me? Cas, I have no choice. This is my destiny."

A wide grin crawls its way onto his face, as Dean marches straight into the pedestrian zone, reserved for the most important event in the world -- the floating banner overhead reads: "38rd Annual Akron Pie Fest."

The air smells sugary and the fragrance of fresh bakery. Dean is practically rushing toward the closest stand, not caring if he might knock someone over on his way.

Cas can't hold back a matching smile, barely can keep up with his eager pace, waiting together for the slow line inching forward toward a tray full of treasure -- the classic apple pie.

Dean picks the largest paper tray they offer and starts filling it with all the delicious pieces. Cas has to remind him not to take more than one slice of each kind, just to try more different flavors.

Dean pouts at the tray as if it betrayed him when it's full -- there are only half a dozen different pieces of pies, why can't it hold more? Though his arm is already sore just from keeping the tray balanced while maneuvering through the crowd.

"That should be enough for a day, Dean." Cas glances at him, holding a hand to protect the pies from the side, just in case someone bumps into it.

"There is no 'enough' for pie. Not for one day, not ever." Dean protests with a straight face.

Cas sighs, taking over the tray for him, nodding at a new stand with a sign saying "the pie you've never tried before" and tells him, "Alright, I'll hold this for you. Why don't you go get another tray? Hopefully that one can take everything you want."

Dean beams at him with the largest smile, as if seeing his personal Heaven standing right in front of him. "I know Jack brought you back for a reason." He bumps into Cas's shoulder fondly, and goes straight for the second tray without hesitation -- not like he needs to be told twice on the pie matter.

They bring back all the pies Dean can manage to the car -- all the outdoor seats are occupied and by the look of those wooden tables and chairs, they'd be too sticky to sit on anyway. Dean places the pie trays safely on the front row seats between them.

The inside of the Impala smells of honey and cinnamon immediately.

Dean aims for a piece with banana and cream first, opens up his mouth as big as he can as if he's still in that Scooby Doo world, stuffing half the pie inside, and lets out a happy, satisfied groan. He indulges himself in the sea of taste bursting out on his tongue with closed eyes.

When he swallows the bite and licks the cream from his lips, Dean mumbles, "Sam has no idea how much he's missing."

"I'm sure he's also having a good time with Eileen abroad," Cas responds.

"Don't think Ireland has these." Dean opens his eyes, gesturing with the remnants of the pie still in his hand, looking up at Cas, only to run into a pair of eyes fixating intensely on his face, lingering around his lips. He wipes the corner of his mouth carelessly.

Cas averts his eyes, considering. "They have shepherd's pie," he reports, factually.

"Not the same thing. They are salty! Ten outta ten as a dish for the meat in there, but they are not pie! Traitors of pie family or something." Dean files his verdict, finishing off the slice in his mouth and eying a second. "And definitely not as good as these. Come on, don't just stare. Eat up. I ain't getting everything for myself."

Cas shifts his gaze to Dean's eyes, almost in surprise. "You're sharing?"

"Of course," Dean says, almost offended by the question. "Why else would I take you on this trip?"

Cas tilts his head, nodding to the tray he had been carrying earlier, with a small mischievous curve at the tip of his mouth. "Oh, I thought it's to hold that for you when your hands are too busy."

Dean shoots him a glare in the middle of chewing his apple pie, not able to speak until he swallows the bite. "Shut up. Just, try them. They're good. Actually, they are the best pies ever."

Cas picks up a small piece of pecan pie and takes a careful bite from the pointy end, contemplating the flavor.

Dean watches him, "Good? Bad? Still molecule?"

Cas puts the pie down with a small sigh. "Still molecule. Probably the only downside of having all my power back."

Dean nods in understanding, taking over the piece and starting to eat from the corner Cas has bit. "Things just can't be perfect, isn't it? We can't have everything we want, but hey, I'm not complaining. You're back, fresh and new, what more can we ask? Maybe just more pies?"

"They're actually not the best pies ever created," Cas not-so-subtly directs the attention back to the pies. Which works so well for Dean's mind right now.

He narrows his eyes, slowly lowering his busy serving hand on its halfway sending the next piece to devouring. "How do you know? You know where to find real good ones and never told me?"

Castiel shifts his gaze away, eyes on the bustling crowd and pie stands in the near distance. "1991 BC, Egypt." he says, matter-of-factly, as if it's one of the simple most obvious unchangeable truths of the world.

Dean stares at him, forgetting to eat. "You're joking."

Cas looks back, meeting his stare with a sincere face. "No, I'm not."

"Four thousand years ago." Dean puts the half-eaten pie down, too distracted to continue now. "That can't possibly be right. Did the word 'pie' even exist back then? Wait, Egypt, they don't even speak English!"

"They were not called 'pie' yet, but does a rose stop being beautiful or smelling the same when it's not called a rose?" Cas retorts.

Dean is muted for a second. "Fair. But how do you know? You just said you can't taste anything now."

Cas shifts slightly in the passenger seat, "That's what I heard. Do you want to go and validate personally if it's true?"

"Do I want --" Dean straightens his back, "Let me get this straight. Are you seriously asking if I want to time travel to *four thousand years ago* to see if a *pie* at that time was *THE best pie* in the whole world of all the time that's ever made?"

Cas blinks, almost shyly. "Yes."

Dean grins wide. "Hell, yeah."

<br>

<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">
<br>

"This looks like a movie," Dean blinks hard under the over-bright desert sun, whispering in awe. He doesn't even dare speak too loudly.

"Technically, it's the movies that look like this," Cas says reasonably. "This comes earlier. It's the original, authentic Middle Kingdom of Egypt, near the end of the Eleventh Dynasty."

Dean looks around. The city is busy. The streets and houses aren't so different from a small modern city, though the most Egyptian movie he's watched was probably *The English Patient* about two decades ago -- which, as far as he can remember, didn't really show much beyond Cairo and desert, and more than half his attention had been captured by Ralph Fiennes (not that he'd ever admit to anyone).

The buildings that look about two stories tall stand steady along the street, surrounded by beautifully carved pillars and ornaments -- must be houses for the riches, if Dean has to guess. Moving stalls with food and livestock line the roads, surrounded by passers-by in plain dresses -- practically the very first version of food trucks.

No wonder ancient Egypt has always had a place in history and lore -- look what they had two thousand years before Jesus. Even from Genesis's view, this city, this culture, is something seriously awesome.

He nudges Cas quietly. "Are we talking about biblical or archeological history here? This gotta be, what, before the Flood and shit like plague?"

Cas answers, "The difference between the two is actually smaller than you think. Exodus wouldn't happen in another five hundred years, no major plague or massacre until then." His voice drops slightly at the end of the sentence, almost sounding guilty.

Dean tries not to think about it too hard. "Great," he murmurs. "Was worried there for a second. Don't wanna get caught in one of those big douchebag fights just on my way to grab some nice pie."

"We won't," Cas reassures him. "I checked, there is no angel in the city right now. Not anywhere on Earth, actually, apart from me."

Dean nods in appreciation.

Some locals walk past them, glancing at them curiously. Dean looks down at himself, feeling more self conscious and out of place than ever.

He tugs the hem of his flannel uneasily, "We gotta look like aliens," he mocks a complaint. "You forgot to mention we should get changed. You know, to blend in."

Cas regards their clothing briefly -- and Dean takes the time to check up Cas's. With his trench coat and three layers, Cas looks more like a spaceman among the locals, and in comparison, Dean is more like a foreign traveler forgetting to get changed before entering the city.

He is just about to make the comment, when Cas starts walking over to one of the stalls with abundant fabrics. The lines and patterns on the clothes shimmer in the sun brightly, catching the eyes -- golden and silvery and all the colors. There are also some more plain-looking tunics and gowns lying among them, the colors more humble and unattractive.

Dean follows him confusedly.

Cas talks rapidly to the husky woman standing behind the stall in a language Dean has absolutely no idea what. His eyes shift between Cas and the woman, trying hard to look less dumb and follow the situation by reading their hand gestures -- Cas doesn't gesture much, so it's mostly the woman's.

She replies cheerfully to whatever Cas told her, eyes flicking between them, sizing up Dean with warm curiosity and interest, then turning back to Cas. Her hands gesture earnestly at the street, the fabrics in the stall, the food stand next to them, then somewhere high and above, with a look of longing on her face. Cas listens to her carefully, supplying simple syllables in between her sentences, nodding and agreeing every now and then. Whatever that language is, Dean thinks, it comes out in Cas's voice and it's becoming one of the hottest languages in his head. Even better than Enochian.

The woman shakes Cas's hand firmly at the end of their conversation, handing two pieces of cloth on her stand to him, and holds out a hand to Dean as well. Dean glances at Cas once before taking her hand and shaking it. "Thank you," he says, offering a smile. Figure at least he gets this part now.

Cas translates for him, and the woman smiles wider and warmer, and finally lets them go.

Dean walks away from the stall, following Cas in the direction the woman pointed them to.

"That's total show off," He glances at Cas from the side, taunting. "What was that? Old Arabic?"

"Middle Egyptian," Cas answers easily. "They won't start speaking Arabic until the Arabs come."

Dean hums quietly, unwilling to show how limited his knowledge of ancient Egyptian history is, but Cas must know anyway. He eyes the two colorful fabrics in Cas's hand. "Let me guess, you just sweet talked your way around and the woman just loved you so much she's willing to give you whatever you want without pay."

Cas blushes.

Dean widens his eyes, barking a laugh. "Wait, really? How come people just always so easily fall in love with you? What'd you tell her?"

Cas blushes harder, but manages an even tone when telling him: "That we're travelers from afar. We bring messages for the Pharaoh, but you are worried our dressing would be improper for the situation. And that we are hungry and thirsty."

"Not wrong, though," Dean concedes. "And what'd you tell her about us? Don't say nothing, I know it's not nothing just by the way she checked me up after you said something."

Cas doesn't meet his eyes, just looking straight ahead. "There is no good word in Middle Egyptian," Cas says with a careful voice, but his eyelashes flutter, "so I took the liberty of using the equivalent of 'partner'."

"*Partner*," Dean parrots, tilting his head to look at Cas, "as in partner in crime or...?"

"Something more intimate," Cas says vaguely. "I hope you don't mind."

"Oh," Dean blinks, then, "yeah I don't mind." He lets it slip.

<br>

The road they're walking on takes a small curve to the left then right. Dean can tell the approaching wealth just by the look of the buildings on the roadside getting taller, wider, and fancier. The carvings on the pillars and frames are increasingly delicate and intricate, the decorations shine golden in the sunlight. The men and women stepping in and out of these places are dressed gorgeously, with grand crests on their heads and dangling jewelries around their necks and waists.

Cas has wrapped those two pieces of cloth so generously provided by that Egyptian woman around both of them, covering their shoulders and arms -- Dean called them "colorful fabric," Cas corrects him with "the accurate term is tunic." They still don't look remotely close to the locals, but at least not as jarring as if Jar Jar Binks walking into the town.

"Are we seriously going to meet the king?" Dean asks, figuring "pharaoh" is just like a king.

"That's usually where all the best food is, so yes. It is the time when Nile just flooded and the current pharaoh, Mentuhotep IV, is hosting a feast. We will invite ourselves in the feast, so you can try the best pie in the world." Cas explains plainly, as if it's easy and obvious and nothing could possibly go wrong.

"And I'll just let you do all the talking, and focus on eating. Just let me know if someone starts yelling 'Run' or 'Fire'." Dean makes a face.

"Do you want to learn the language?" Cas stops his steps, turning to Dean.

"What? Like I can learn how to say 'Hello' and 'Thank you'? Time is a little short for a language-learning course, don't you think?" Dean halts in the middle of the road as well, one side of the eyebrow raised.

"Not at all." Cas tabs two fingers on Dean's forehead. "Now you know everything I knew about Middle Egyptian, and should be able to speak it as fluently as English."

Just like every time he's healed by Cas, a small wave of warmth flood through his body from the place Cas touched. And, Vola -- Dean realizes with amazement that he can understand all the mundane chitchat on the street now: all those everyday chatters in the background -- a customer standing by the closest stall is arguing the price of some spice, saying it might not be the real stuff; two people farther down the road are asking about each other's families and health, sounding like two friends haven't seen each other for a while; a kid is babbling simple vocabulary, bugging his mom for some exotic food in a stand. The meanings of those foreign syllables serve up in his brain like they are speaking in plain English.

"Holy," Dean gasps, taking a step back automatically, trying to steady himself. Cas reaches a hand to hold him.

"Are you okay?" Cas asks with concern.

"It's like downloading a new language package," Dean says, staring at Cas in disbelief. "Did you just, like... install a new language into my brain system or something?"

"The same way Metatron gave me all the knowledge of pop culture from books and movies," Cas explains patiently.

"Angel brainwave transfer," Dean nods with a small grin. "Faster than USB or data cables. Got it. Sam would love it so much."

"It was out of necessity," Cas says. "I thought you wanted it?" He imitates Dean's tone, "So that you wouldn't have to 'only focus on eating while I do all the talking.'"

"So I wouldn't look like a dumb idiot, right, yeah, that's very thoughtful." Dean nods dryly.

"You are not dumb even if you don't know the language," Cas says firmly, turning to Dean fully. "You should stop saying that. You are the most intelligent, knowledgeable, experienced, strategic --"

"Yeah, thanks, I get it," Dean cuts him off urgently, rubbing his ears, glancing at the palace not too far down the road. "Can we go now? Can't wait to see that legendary pie you keep talking about. The sun is roasting me alive, too."

Cas stares at him for another long second, and then turns to continue leading the way without argue. Dean follows.

<br>

Cas introduces the two of them as ambassadors of Babylon, when a man in a simple dark green tunic greets them kindly at the entrance. The style is plain yet elegant, Dean notices, he regards the man more carefully. His meaner is humble but so clearly well-educated just from the words he chooses to use, from the way he speaks and holds himself. Dean might not know much about ancient Egypt's power hierarchy, but he knows how to read a man. A golden disk around his waist catches his eyes, probably something to show that he's no common servant.

Dean lets Cas handle the fake-ambassador formality stuff.

When the greetings and introductions are done -- which, as it turns out, the language isn't really the major obstacle, Dean understands each words but he still can't even remember those fake Babylonian names Cas comes up with for them, his mind tuned out after the "Hello" -- Dean mummers quietly under his breath, "Didn't realize you got the whole cover story ready. How long have you been planning this, Cas?" The Egyptian host doesn't hear him, inviting them into the palace with a welcoming gesture. Cas tilts his head slightly to him, answering with an equally quiet "Later."

Dean almost rolls his eyes, but Cas has a point, they're not really in a good talking place. Dean shoves his million questions down.

The man introduces himself as "Amenemhat." Cas's eyes widen at the name, looking surprised. Dean notices, but decides to just add that to the growing list of questions. He'll ask when they're left alone.

Dean has to continue listening to them chat about crops, livestock, river quality, and the weather for another ten minutes before Amenemhat excuses himself.

"Please feel at home," the man tells them gently before leaving. "The feast will begin in no time."

They are seated about midway down the extremely long table that takes up the entire grand hall, so long that one end can't possibly see or hear the other. Not even *Game of Throne* has anything remotely close to this level of grandeur. The impressive table is covered with food of all kinds, plates decorated with extravagant shiny golden trim. Fruits and nuts are placed between meats, alongside breads and pastries. Some meat plates are still recognizable by their shape -- heads of swine, body of swan, full of lamb, duck, fish -- many of them are still so vividly preserving their shape of living, it almost looks like their eyes are glaring at the guests with reproach. Dean shifts in his seat uneasily, meeting the dead gaze of the roasted swine head in the plate right in front of him, and has to reach out to turn its direction after ten minutes.

The hall is packed with guests. It turns out they are not the most exotic-looking people here. Dean's eyes jump from one to another, near overwhelmed. He nudges Cas, having to distract himself with something. "Alright, spill. What's wrong? I know that poop face, that's the 'something's wrong and I don't know what to do so I might do something reckless' face."

Cas was still staring in the direction Amenemhat left, but shifts his gaze to Dean when he's asked. He narrows his eyes. "I'm not planning anything reckless."

"You didn't deny something is wrong," Dean points out sharply.

"Amenemhat is the vizier of the Pharaoh," Cas tells him, tone solemn and slow.

"Okay?" Dean doesn't follow.

"He's the second most important man in the kingdom," Cas pauses, waiting for him to catch up, "then why is him tasked to greeting and seating guests? Something any servant could do? Instead of standing beside the Pharaoh, offering counsel? And where is Mentuhotep IV? The feast is about to begin, he should be here socializing with all the guests now, as the Middle Egyptian etiquette requires. I'm worried some other divine power is at play, disturbing the history."

Dean rubs his head tiredly. "They must have some reason -- I mean, normal, natural reasons. We are just here for the pie, remember? Can't we just have a fancy Egyptian dinner and *THE best pie* you promised, and get out without, I don't know, getting into some Egyptian trouble? Last I remember, we didn't get into too good terms with Egyptian dudes like Osiris or Anubis, still not interested in running into their four-thousand-year younger versions if we start poking."

Cas hums noncommittally, but his attention shifts back to the dinning table as Dean suggested, studying the roasted swine head studiously as if it can offer him some clue to the puzzle.

Dean can tell from his face the thoughts still lingering in his head. He sighs quietly, then offers, "Alright, how about this? If, *after* the dinner, something is still seriously off, and we know somehow that's our kind of business, *then* we take a look and stick our noses in? Only *after*! Got it?" He leans over, emphasizing the word, giving Cas a pointed look.

Cas casts him a quick glance, nodding appreciatedly. "Yes. Sorry, I got distracted." He manages a tight smile.

Dean waves it off.

For the next half hour or so, Dean busies himself by rummaging through Cas's encyclopedic knowledge of ancient Egypt -- mostly on the historical anecdote part, shooting questions of all sorts, many of them involving the guests in the room. It is fun, Dean thinks, laughing and sipping the wine in front of him absentmindedly.

Dean meets Cas's eyes when he's laughing to tears hearing a story about how the famous Queen of Egypt, Cleopatra, is totally different from what the human history tends to portray, and notices the cringed lines at the corner of the angel's eyes has smoothed, and that Cas is looking at him just as intensely, carrying a small, soft smile of his own. Dean's heart skips a beat. He has to take another gulp on the wine, which nearly drained half the glass.

Cas knows all the royals' names in the hall and pretty much all the answers to his random questions, except for the ones he mentioned *The English Patient* and *Night at the Museum* -- for which it's Dean's turn to tell his impression on this land.

He doesn't miss the chance to talk about mummies and all the movies about pyramids, either. It's not his fault that the most known facts about Egypt seems always around mummy mysteries, which constitutes pretty much all his limited knowledge about Egypt, and therefore makes Cas's stories a hundred times more interesting than he knows possible.

Even the mummy stories Cas tells him sound so much more fun than the lore he learned about, from the way Cas describes -- the spices they'd use, the rituals and procedures of preparing, the fabrics they wrap them with, the meanings of the carvings near their tombs, the jewelries they're buried with -- actually, mummies are the best part of the story. Apparently, they're not always living dead monsters, at least not all of them.

Dean is fascinated, not realizing he's probably been staring at Cas for way too long, leaning in closely to hear every syllable of his words and every little sound of his laughter unconsciously. Dean shifts his eyes hurriedly as soon as he realizes how close they are sitting next to each other, their knees brushing against each other. He wonders why the room temperature increases so much when he's busy catching all the movements on Cas's lips, flipping and fluttering as all the fun facts and knowledge and stories dancing out. Cas really knows everything about everything, because he's an angel, for God's sake -- something Dean keeps forgetting but always gets reminded in the most bewildering moments. And right now, the said angel is sitting next to him, talking to him over a table of feast, and smiling at him with those dopey eyes, like he's the only man existing in the universe right now, the only one mattered.

Dean doesn't know what to do with that look in his eyes and the fluttering heart in his chest. His mind has flew away, snapping to that night in the dungeon without his permission. The look on Cas's face now mirrors the one then. It's always the same look, dedicated, fixated on Dean, eying him in a way that always seems staring directly into his soul. Cas has never looked at him in any different way, probably since the moment they met in that barn all those years ago. The end of the world was merely months ago, fresh in the memory, so is all the desperate pain when he thought he lost him forever again. And they still haven't really talked about it.

Dean swallows hard, draining the wine, dragging his mind back before the lump in his throat chokes him.

The hall falls into solemn silence just as Dean's about to ask when the feast will start -- and more importantly, when the pie is gonna come. Two men move slowly into the hall from the far deep end, the end that has all the lights yet also the most shadows. All the guests stand up when they emerge into the view, Dean and Cas do the same. Bright light from the ceiling pour on them as they arrive, dazzling like jewels. Dean has to squint in the strong light, briefly blinded. Beside him, he hears Cas inhale harshly.

The Pharaoh is cloaked in layers under layers of fabric, the colors of sun and desert draping him in the undoubtfully the most expensive material in the country. His hands are concealed beneath the long heavy sleeves, his feet move sluggishly under long skirt of the gowns and robes. The crest is inlayed with jewels on every inch of the material, standing twice as tall as his head, burdening his neck. Thick black lines paint on his face like a mask. The man looks no older than his age, Dean thinks, but those eyes are hazy and worn as if he's already eighty and near blind. He reminds him of King Théoden from *Lord of the Rings* during the mind-control time.

"Guess we know why it took so long now," Dean whispers. "Man's busy in the dressing room."

Cas shakes his head at him, shushing him quiet under his breath. Dean shuts his mouth, seeing all the tension around Cas's eyes.

The other man supporting the Pharaoh's arms before he's properly seated then standing right next to him, wears barely a ring of necklace around his neck and the simplest skirt around his hip, plain as if it's just a random rag he pulled out of a dumpster and doesn't mind wearing it everywhere. He does wear a crest of his own, poking out tall and splitting in two at the ends, almost looking like two standing ears of some wild desert creature. His chest and upper body are bare and well-built, tan and strong with beautiful muscle curves.

Dean squints at the symbol on his necklace. "I swear I've seen it somewhere," he says, but he has to rack his brain to remember where or what the meaning might be. But definitely, most definitely from one of the lore books in the bunker when they were doing research on how to summon and trap Anubis for Lily Sunder, which means, if his luck is as good as ever, this guy might be in the same tier as Anubis. Awesome. So much for a peaceful pie trip.

The Pharaoh starts speaking, welcoming the guests and glorifying the Nile and their gods for another year of good harvest, yada yada yada. It doesn't escape Dean's notice that every now and then, the suspicious creature-looking man bends over to the Pharaoh's ear and murmurs something. That's how the next paragraph of speech continues. Not even a very subtle mind-control trick, Dean thinks, glancing around, almost expecting more people to notice the abnormality up there right before everyone's eyes, only to find them have their heads low and bowed, listening to the speech of the probably God-like ruler to them. Classic.

Dean leans forward -- Cas's seat is closer to the front of the table, so from where they stand now, if Dean leans forward, his lips are right behind Cas's ear. He whispers, "Please tell me I'm not the only one thinking this looks sketchy."

"You're not, but now isn't a good time," Cas urges quietly. "He might be able to hear you."

From this distance? Dean is just about to ask before he can stop himself, thinking twice. Ancient Egypt is a land of gods, just like Greece and Roman. They are used to call them pagan gods, but gods nonetheless. Who knows what this one can do? And from the look of Cas's tightened jaw, he probably knows some insights. Might as well wait to see how it plays out before jumping into the fire again. For once, Dean shuts his mouth wisely as told.

The speech drags on and on, after the praising for the god Ra of the sun, Horus of the sky, then something about the Nile, some other announcements in the change of the royal structure, the demotion of the Vizier, the decision of building higher walls as the city fortress, the higher amount in the tribute. Dean finds the man's voice hypnotic. He can't hold back a yawn coming out of his mouth.

The speech stops abruptly. The silence feels choking, the air heavy and venomous.

Dean's gut twitches uneasily. He stands closer to Cas, just out of instinct. Cas's hand reaches back toward him just as automatically, the glint of Angel Blade flashing at the edge of his sleeve. A sense of comfort shoots straight through his spine just from the view of that.

But the part of the gut that senses danger doesn't put off the alarm. The hairs at the back of his neck stand on end in the sudden ominous silence in the grand hall. Dean thinks he can hear his own heartbeat and breathing pace standing out from the hundreds of guests in the room.

He senses, more than sees, a pair of sharp creature-like eyes shooting his direction. The man with ear-shaped crest that's pretty certainly is a pagan god of some sort bends down by the Pharaoh's ear once more and murmurs something, just like he did so many times before.

And the dazed Pharaoh speaks, "I announce, as a decision made solemnly, for the benefit of Egypt: The war on Babylon begins today. Hang the ambassadors!"

Dean's mind blanks out for a split second. Okay, a bit sudden, but, phew, nothing directed to him, they're safe, right? Let those ancient men fight as they like, he and Cas will be home in no time, right?

"Cas," Dean starts, right when Cas swirls around rapidly, eyes startled wide, the Angel Blade already drawn into his hand, his whole body tensed, battle ready.

"Dean," Cas says, with eyes so wide in disbelief, "that's us. The ambassadors of Babylon, that's us!"

<br>

The guests are stirred like ducks startled by a heavy stone in a pond, flying in all directions with flustering wings. They hurry out of their seats in chaos, fleeing backward, trying to get away from them as far as possible. The space around them are quickly cleared out with a radius of five feet and increasing. Armed men with spears approach them in a surrounding circle from behind the pillars of the hall, closing in quickly.

Dean glances at the way they came in, not surprised to find the gate closed and most likely locked. Just like the bloody Red Wedding from *Game of Thrones*, just his luck.

Dean shrugs off the tunic, reaching for his gun at his belt, glad for a brief second, even though without the whole weaponry in the Baby, he still has his 1911 with him, after all these years. But a quick scan at the surrounding royal army, his heart sinks. There is no way the two of them can take down all those soldiers, even if they do, then what? Even if they can handle them, they don't know how many more would come. Besides, those ancient Egyptians are only just following orders -- all so young, boys barely coming of age. It just doesn't feel right.

"Forget to check your history book, Cas? Battle day or what?" Dean asks behind him, the two of them standing gingerly, back to back. Dean counts the surrounding number quietly.

"This isn't supposed to happen!" Cas hisses, "I would never have brought you here if I had known. The Battle of Carchemish isn't supposed to happen for another century and a half! The Egyptians and Babylonians are supposed to be on good terms right now."

"Well, apparently they are not anymore." Dean holds his pistol with both hands, but not even sure of who he should aim. Those boys in pre-historical armor and spears? They might not hesitate to kill him but he's still feeling bad for them.

"That wolf-ear counselor, any idea who he is? Got a gut feeling he's not human." Dean chances another glance at the far end of the table, noticing the man he's talking about stands still, looking at the chaos in the room with a satisfying smile on his face -- not too different from Chuck's when he stands in the graveyard waiting for him to kill Jack last year. What's with all the douchbag higher powers always just enjoying watching men kill each other? Dean grits his teeth, fingers itching, almost feeling like having to kill Chuck all over again.

"He's not," Cas answers, proving his suspicion. Sometimes Dean hopes he's not right all the time -- Sam's possible retorts don't count.

"-- And I can't use my power right now." Cas's voice is less even now, quivering at the end of the sentence. Dean can feel him trying to roll his back as if to spread his wings to fly them out of here but nothing happens. Cas sounds so sick worried that his voice is bouldering terrified, "I'm so sorry, Dean. I didn't know... I should've..."

"It's okay," Dean comforts him quickly, gathering himself. "Not your fault, we'll figure it out. We handled Chuck, we can handle another pagan god. Just need to figure out who he is."

"If I can get closer to observe his symbols, maybe --"

"I'll cover you." Dean doesn't need the whole sentence out to start moving. The Egyptian soldiers charge forward to start the attack at the same moment.

The sound of the first gun fire startles them like bonfire scaring off wild animals, but that only buys them less than a minute. Cas leaps forward toward the front end of the table, fighting off the long-reaching spears with his angel blade, flipping and turning in the air like the best samurai in Akira Kurosawa's best action movie. He's like Neo in the first *Matrix*, with all the fancy Kungfu moves, minus the bullet-catching moment. Dean knows he's a damn good fighter, and no matter how many times he's witnessed Cas in fighting, it would never stop making his blood boil. Or bring him chills. Both.

Dean watches Cas from the periphery of his eyes, almost too amazed to focus on his own fight, but the pointy sharp tips of the soldiers' weapons close in quickly, forcing him to turn his attention back to the battle. He sweeps the gun around, shifting the aim from one Egyptian soldier to another, whoever comes too close, and gunning down the one who almost gets a hold on Cas. The blood of that young soldier spatter onto the dining table. The caged crowd standing at the edge of the hall gasp out loudly in horror. Dean doesn't have the luxury to think about saving those other civilians right now.

He moves along the table, covering Cas's back, following him to approach those two men that seem to have the power to start all this with a flip of their fingers, which means it should be their solution to end all the mess before the whole civilization-wise battle starts -- wait, is this the exact one that wipes Babylon out of the map? Must be the Apocalypse for them then.

Christ, who remembers he's only here for some pie? He doesn't even see anything remotely look like a single damn pie, unless counting those two big bowl of oat and wheat pastry before the Pharaoh's seat as pie crust, but that's about it. He should probably remind Cas to only bring them when dessert is served next time, otherwise, zero star for this Egyptian restaurant, doesn't matter how antique they are. Dean almost laughs at his own brain for still having the capability of thinking about pies in life-death situation like this. Must be the new neural reflex from all the other Apocalypse rehearsals.

His gun runs out of bullets shortly. Dean has to snatch a spear from one of those guardian soldiers and swings just like another ancient Egyptian. Falling into their comfortable fighting realm, he has zero advantage over the locals, and their weapons begin to wound him constantly. One stab cuts through his arm, another through his calf. Dean grits his teeth, breathing heavily. His moves are slowed down drastically by the pain. He manages to keep standing, but only barely. He doesn't think he can last much longer, probably the only soothing thought by then in his mechanically auto-pilot mode fighting head is -- If those men are focused on attacking him, then maybe Cas is safe.

"Dean!"

Right when Dean thinks he's too exhausted to keep standing and fighting, he hears Cas's yelling, and a pair of strong hands yanking him firmly away from the attacking tips of those sharp spears, hauling him closer to the table as a shelter. Cas is right there, holding him straight, supporting the weight of his body his wounded leg now is struggling to do its job. His arms are so solid and steady -- so is his whole existence. Dean leans on him.

They are at the end of the table now, six feet away from the Pharaoh and the suspicious man. The soldiers surround them with a circle of another six feet distance, forming a ring, not closing in anymore. Dean realizes, they're probably more afraid of those two of their rulers than of them.

"You figured it out? Who's the wolfie?" Dean pants heavily, leaning against Cas's shoulder. The Pharaoh stares numbly at the plates before him, uncaring of anything that is currently tumbling in his kingdom, breaking apart probably at any second. The other man checks them up with calm amusement and overt interest.

"Yes," Cas says, meeting the man's gaze, but still answering Dean. "He's not a wolf, he's a jackal."

"Not bad," the man smiles, showing some glints of teeth. He's not bad-looking, if Dean's completely honest with himself, especially when he's only standing straight, all solemn and normal. But now with that smirky smile, Dean can see the similarity of a nasty creature behind the human skin. The ears are tipping off too.

"Say it then. Say my name, Angel," he challenges lazily, as if not worrying the slightest even if they can figure out his identity, they wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

"Wepwawet," Cas says.

Dean almost chokes on a sudden laugh he didn't expect coming. He evens his breath, still finding it hard to hold back the laugh, "Dude, that's the worst monster name I've ever heard, and that includes Chupacabra. Who gave it to you? Don't tell me it's another deadbeat drunk dad?"

Even Cas shoots him a quick warning glare that Dean interprets as "Not appropriate, Dean! We don't want to provoke him." Dean stifles the rest of the laugh down.

"He's the god of war, royalty, and funerary rites for ancient Egyptians," Cas says quietly, only meant for Dean to hear. But Wepwawet nods in approval.

"That explains so much," Dean says, unafraid, nodding at the probably-dozed-off Pharaoh. "The man fits all three. And you just can't resist starting wars everywhere, don't you? News flash, buddy, we killed War before, think a wolfie is tougher than Hell's Horseman?"

Wepwawet barks out a loud laughter, his pupil turning golden amber when he stares at Dean again. His teeth turning into pointy fangs. He still manages to maintain the smile, and says, "You have no idea what you're dealing with." And lunges at them with fangs flashing out.

The last thing Dean knows, is Cas yelling his name desperately, tightening his hands around him.

Then his world falls dark.

<br>

Dean wakes up with a groan.

He's not dead yet, that much he can be sure of. For one, this damp, dark space is definitely not Heaven, it can't be. And second, it's not Hell either -- there is a comforting weight around him, like arms wrapped tight around his body, protecting him in his sweet unconscious sleep. Which stirs when he makes the sound and starts moving. Which starts saying "Dean, are you alright?" in the most familiar, terrified, worried, deep voice of the angel.

Dean answers automatically, "Cas? You there?" He blinks hard, trying to get used to the lack of light in this -- is this a dungeon?

A fumbling hand grasps his hand, squeezing in relief. "Yes, it's me. I'm so glad you're okay."

Shapes emerge from the darkness slowly. Dean thinks he can figure out the silhouette kneeling right next to him now. He lifts his arm -- which still hurts and is probably bleeding, from the stingy sensation on the upper arm, but he can ignore it for a minute -- and puts his hand on where he thinks Cas's arm is, giving him a quick squeeze in reassurance, then sliding down onto his hand, resting there. "I'm fine, Cas. How about you?"

"I'm fine," Cas answers simply, his voice tired and upset, not taking his hand away. Dean doesn't need to see his face to know what he's thinking. This feels far too much like Deja Vu here, just the two of them, hopelessly trapped in a place they can't figure out how to get out. The dungeon, dammit, just like the bunker dungeon, and for Christ's sake, what's it with them in a dungeon, facing some terrifying powerful beings? It's like a poor joke from Fate -- and a not very creative one. If Dean is remembering that moment, then sure enough, Cas is definitely thinking of the exact same thing which is so clearly beating him up.

"Cas, listen, it's not your fault." Dean starts, sitting straighter from the corner he lays, groaning as his muscles protest. "We'll get out, we'll get home. I know it. We'll be fine." Nothing like last time is going to happen again. Nothing is going to take Cas away again, or kill him, if that's what Cas's been afraid of. No one is going to deal themselves away for the other this time. Dean thinks hard on that thought, holding Cas's hands in his, holding it warm and film.

"It's just like last time," Cas says, voice desperate, panicked and wet. "I'm the one leading us to the cage this time. And I don't have another deal to save us, to save you..."

"I don't think I'd survive that a second time if it happened," Dean hears himself saying.

They never really talked about that night, not even after Cas was brought back, one part of Dean's mind says. The other parts blink blankly. He's afraid, Dean realizes. He doesn't even know what he's afraid of, but his heart clenches hard, choking him breathless now. The answer is right there, on tip of his tongue, lingering in the dark quiet air. And without his brain registering, his mouth is already spilling the truth.

"I don't think..." Dean hears his mouth saying, slowly, one word at a time, just to not choke on the syllables, "I don't think I can survive losing you ever again. Because, because --" his breath hitches, his voice shuddering, he has to take a couple deep breath to even it again, then, "-- because I love you too, Cas. So damn much. I should have told you last time. I should have said it earlier. I don't know why I didn't..."

His voice chokes in his throat, tears falling. Dean remembers the Purgatory all of a sudden, that second trip for the Leviathan Blossom, when he held on that tree trunk, praying an apology. The words feel so familiar. So painful. Tearing him apart from inside. Another Deja Vu. Why do those words always have to wait until the end of the line to come out? Except, no, not this time, it can't be the end of the line. None of them are going to die. Not again. Not over a damn freaking pie.

He feels two arms slowly wrap around his body in the dark, cloth rustling, Cas moving closer, pulling him into a hug in his kneeling pose. Dean raises his upper body, holding back. The posture is awkward, shifting to meet him, his arms and his body sort and hurting, but it doesn't matter. In the dark dungeon in some creepy Egyptian god's palace, four thousand years earlier than their own time, they are holding each other tight like there is nothing else exists or matters in the world. And it feels right.

Cas rests his chin on Dean's shoulder, shuddering. Dean pats his back gently, murmuring things like "It's okay. We're okay." over and over again, until they both start believing it.

They finally pull apart. Each wiping their damp eyes.

Cas waits until both their breathing evens out and then tells him, "I will not let you experience that again, I promise." Dean smiles. Even though it's still too dark to see anything in here, he's sure Cas sees his smile anyway.

"Shall we call Jack?" Dean suggests, after a beat of silence. "Think he'd be able to pull us out of here?"

"I already tried praying when you were in coma. He did not answer," Cas tells him miserably, then adds. "I think... this might be one of the fixed points even he couldn't reach or alter, considering how important ancient Egypt is in the Bible."

"Out of his jurisdiction, huh?" Dean says, annoyed. "I keep forgetting we're in BC-time, not even Jesus is born yet. The holy book-recorded biblical time."

The two of them fall silent, contemplating on other options they might have. The place is quiet for a moment. No sound except for the dripping water from the dungeon ceiling.

Then, from some distant stairwell, there comes a quiet rustle of clothing, descending closer. Cas stands up gingerly, positioning himself between the direction of the sound and Dean.

A figure emerges outside the bars. A man calls their fake Babylonian names quietly in a eager tone. Dean recognizes the voice. The vizier.

"Amenemhat," Cas greets him, slightly relaxed. If not a little surprised.

"The God of War has fallen asleep and changed back to his original form -- a jackal," the man tells them rapidly. "If you know how to kill him, this might be your chance. I am glad the fate still favors us, for I still have the key to the dungeon." He unlocks the cell for them.

Dean pulls himself upright from the ground with a limp and a grunt, stepping toward the man slowly. "Why are you helping us? If we try and fail, you'll be hanged for treason." Not that he doesn't trust him, but it's a reasonable question, Dean thinks.

"Something tells me you know how to do it right, and you won't fail." The man offers a small encouraging smile. "Besides, even if it gets me killed, at least I'll be hanged for trying to save this land. I cannot think of a better way to go." His voice is calm even at the mention of his own possible death, Dean admires him.

"How do the local hunters trap a jackal?" Cas asks him.

"Food in a trap," Amenemhat tells them. "Sugar, fruit, nuts, chicken... They eat everything. They are the most difficult when they are in a pack, so the hunters would use food and traps to lure them separately, it would become easier to hunt them down."

Dean exchanges a hopeful glance with Cas. Knowing a plan is forming in their heads.

"One more thing," Cas asks politely, "is there any chance you can get us a kind of very special oil from Jerusalem?"

They do not expect the vizier to nod for that seemingly bizarre request without hesitation, but apparently over the last seven years when Mentuhotep IV was ruling under Wepwawet's influence, the vaults of Egypt have amassed its collection tremendously, and it doesn't miss out one of the most biblically sacred and valuable treasure in the world.

Cas thanks him full-heartedly. Dean does the same.

<br>

They also borrowed a kitchen.

Not from the vizier though, for this one, but from the woman on the road offering them the tunics -- it would have been in too high risk to prepare everything under the jackal's nose, figuratively or literally. Dean feels a tad guilty when he remembers the clothe had been left behind during the fight in that grand dining hall. Amenemhat recognized her immediately from what Cas described, and they knocked on her door in the middle of the night. The moon is still high in the night sky, but the time is running out fast.

The woman was startled by their visit at first, but knowing the whole story -- technically it's the simplified version provided by Cas -- she did not hesitate. Even offered a hand around the kitchen. Bless her soul.

Dean throws himself into the task: Preparing a trap too tempting and distractive for the jackal god to recognize. Lure him in with food exotic and innovative in this time that the creature instinct side of him wouldn't be able to resist, and confine him with the holy oil that they have to believe would work.

"It has to be something he has never tried before for him to fall for, something that doesn't exist in this time. And it has to smell and taste the most tempting among everything he has ever tasted, for a God to fail the resist," the vizier has warned.

Dean starts with mixing honey, cinnamon, and apples, tasking Cas with crushing nuts, and the kind Egyptian woman -- whose name is Neferitatjenen -- working on kneading flour and water into soft doughs. He has a perfect idea of what he's going to create.

<br>

The downfall of Wepwawet almost feels too easy. The jackal doesn't stand a chance in the presence of the food no one in this era has ever seen before -- the round dish is fresh and heated, the golden crust is crispy yet soft, the filling is sugar-sweet with fragrance of fruit and nuts, shaped like a closed bowl, placed on a large flat plate. Cas finishes it off with a beautiful intricate pattern painted on its surface with the holy honey they mixed together. Dean is glad they decided to prepare it out of the palace -- half the court would wake up in its sweet scent had they prepared it in the royal kitchen.

Amenemhat helps sneak it into the grand hall. They wait in the dark shadows.

The jackal god leaves the chamber, sniffing the air greedily, approaching it through the descending stairs. His paws padding across the floor. He's still cautious.

The creature's steps are slow, as if his brain is trying to stop the steps, but the feet are not listening to the control, carrying him toward the source of the smell by instinct. His snout twitches more violently by each step closer to the delicious creation. Until he's right in front of the dish.

They watch him from the dark hideouts.

*Dig in, you bastard, what are you waiting for?* Dean murmurs in his mind, watching intensely, holding his breath.

The jackal glances around him casually one last time, the motion so cursory it seems he's not even really scanning for any potential danger. The dish smells unbelievably tempting and amazing -- to man, to god, to any creature and any beings.

He starts gulping in, chewing and swallowing the golden crust along with the sweet filling, making a satisfied, delightful moaning growl as he devours.

Dean huffs in relief.

The sigil painted on the surface of the crust brightens, glowing in a light amber color -- almost can be mistaken for honey's original color. The jackal doesn't even seem to notice.

They wait until the plate is licked clean to come out.

Wepwawet finally notices them. The creature whines when the jackal's body twitches, as if it still tries to transform into the man once stood behind the Pharaoh and whispered orders to start a war, but no matter how hard he tries, the shape remains a jackal.

"It tastes good, doesn't it?" Dean smiles, loosely pointing a blade at the creature, but worry and fear has left him. Cas stands by his side, angel blade in his palm.

The jackal opens its mouth, possibly trying to threaten their necks with its teeth, but it turns into a lazy yawn. Some sweet scrap of the pastry it just devoured could still be seen in between its fangs. It doesn't look half as menacing as a homegrown pet dog, a Chihuahua or something on a leash.

"Don't feel too bad, at least you got a nice tasty meal." Dean changes the blade to a chain, managing to tie around the creature's neck. It tried to get away, wrestling them for a few rounds, then trying its luck in hide-and-seek. But with the strength of an ordinary jackal, the efforts are all in vain.

The moment the creature is in chains -- which has been hand carved with sigils, also credit to Cas -- it lays down onto the floor, finally giving up all the attempt in resistance. And Cas, at the meantime, exhales with a happy relieved breath, rolling his shoulders with a crackling sound. There is a burst of lightning and thunder above their heads, candles flickering in the sudden wind inside the hall even though the windows and doors are shut tight. Though Cas doesn't exactly show his wings like in the barn when they first met, Dean thinks he senses an invisible one right over his shoulders from the prickling electricity in the air -- Cas's power is back. Dean smiles triumphantly.

Amenemhat regards the tied jackal carefully. "Is that it? Wepwawet no longer has his power? How did you do it?"

Dean beams, gesturing the now empty plate. "Let's just say 'A magic pie saved the day.'"

But Cas goes into a more detailed explanation of how when the sigil painted by holy oil was consumed by the unguarded Wepwawet, it has stripped him of the divinity and bound him back to the primordial form, so he has transformed into a defenseless jackal just like any other wild jackal creatures.

Dean nods alongside him, concluding once Cas finishes, "Right, so that's how the pie saved the day."

Amenemhat listens to them in awe. "What did you call that magic food? A p-i-e?" He enunciates the syllable reverently, as if worshiping the existence of the word, as if the word has never been born until this very moment -- which is true in all the ways, oh God. Dean is stricken with realization, glancing at Cas, about to ask if he just changed the world and the history by inventing the pie personally, when the vizier kneels down before him, speaking again with all the devotion and formality Dean doesn't think he deserves:

"The very first existence of *'pie'* is created today, so is the word that names it. I shall memorize the process of its making, and share the knowledge of its creation with the whole realm of Egypt and beyond, to commemorate that this is the day, the God of Pie and his partner defeated the God of War, and saved people of Egypt from blood and violence. I shall correct the wrong doings of our misguided leader and remind our people with the sweetness of our feast that the peace is the path forward. I humbly plead for your permission, to honor the creation of *pie* and to spread its making, for it is the best creation we have ever witnessed, for the peace and fortune it brings us."

The vizier bows at Dean.

Dean stares with a gaped mouth. Cas nudges him, nodding at the man waiting for an answer.

Dean stutters, "Yes! Yes, of course. You have my permission. Make more pies, make better pies, let everyone know."

His eyes fluttering to Cas, Dean mouths, in the aftermath of the shock, "Did I... did I just get called the freaking 'God of Pie'?!"

Cas nods solemnly, as a smile escapes the corner of lips, spreading across his face, reaching his eyes. "Yes," he says, cheerfully, "yes, indeed. And I think it is a very appropriate name for you."

<br>
<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">
<br>

They fly home shortly. No need to keep lingering.

"We just got rid of War for them," Dean thinks aloud, once they're home, safely back in the bunker. "Does that mean there will be no more war in Egypt? Wouldn't that, like, change the whole history of Egypt or something?"

"Do humans ever really need a god to start wars?" Cas retorts.

Dean shrugs. "Fair," then, just out of curiosity, "What happened next for them? After we left? Please tell me we didn't butterfly-effect anything."

Cas tells him, "Mentuhotep IV was too sick to rule later that same year. Amenemhat took the throne and became Amenemhat I, the next Pharaoh. So started the Twelfth Dynasty of Middle Egypt."

"Good for him," Dean approves, wandering absently into the kitchen, opening a cabinets, scanning the inside. "I liked him. That man seemed decent enough to actually do some good to the people."

Cas nods in agreement. "That new dynasty is indeed considered by many, the apex of Middle Kingdom. There was no war with Babylonians or Arabians for over a century, as they should. The history remains intact as far as I can tell."

Dean hums softly, reaching for the things he was looking for in the pantry.

Cas eyes him, standing two steps away, hesitating, then, tentatively, "Now that we know that pie existed since ancient Egypt, would you like to go back there again sometimes? I promise next time I'll scout the whole time and space closely before we go. Or we can go to the diner in the town, if you prefer it that way." His voice is carefully controlled.

Dean is too busy examining the ingredients in his hands. Frowning at the expiration date of a bag of all-purpose flour, and gesturing the kitchen broadly as a whole with a glass of honey in his other hand, Dean says, "Why bother? I can just recreate *my* invention in our kitchen, isn't it? I'm the 'God of Pie', remember?" He chuckles at the name. "We need a grocery run though."

"You are not going to stop telling everyone that any time soon, are you?" Cas asks, handing him the fruit basket that was at the corner of the counter, with a few leftover apples and half a bundle of bananas in it.

"Never," Dean says firmly, grinning as wide as that time he ganked Hitler. He takes the fruits from Cas, glancing inside, and starts scribbling a list of what they'd need for the grocery run.

<br>

The bunker is brimming with sweet fragrance when there is a knock at the front door. Dean's hands are occupied with taking the freshly made pies to the dinner table, so it is Cas's job to open the door.

Sam and Eileen come in, each carrying a large travel-sized suitcase, still sign-chatting intensely as they walk down the stairs. Dean greets them at the bottom of the steps.

"How's the dating trip?" he asks them, expectantly. "Got me any souvenirs or anything?"

"Dean, you have no idea what we found in Ireland," Sam laughs.

"This was all Sam's idea," Eileen announces, bending over to open their suitcases. Placed beautifully inside, just as the phrase goes -- in perfect apple-pie order -- are unmistakably, apple pies, made in Ireland.

Dean drops his jaw. "You brought me pie, from freaking Ireland, when you were on a dating trip?" He speaks in a voice so dramatic that it sounds like he's going to burst into tears at any moment.

Then the next moment, "Wait, since when do they make such nice, good quality, delicious food?" Dean flashes an apologetic look at Eileen and quickly adds a "No offense", to which she answers with a smirking "None taken."

Dean turns to Cas. "I thought you said they only have shepherd's pie."

Before Cas can answer, Sam says, "That's what I thought too, that's what Eileen remembered from her childhood. But one minute we were in this food desert, and the next, we just found this place with all the pies. The restaurant was said to have inherited for more than a thousand years, and their ancestor once visited Egypt, where the pie was first created, and had met the 'God of Pie.' A pretty wild founder's story, isn't it?"

Dean exchanges a quick knowing look with Cas, raising an amused eyebrow. Cas says, resigned, "Here we go."

Sam watches them closely. He rolls his eyes. "Wait, you got anything to do with that? What did you do?"

Dean is more than happy to share the whole story -- though he tripped over the Egyptian names, any one except that memorable Wepwawet, so Cas supplied those whenever he needed a hand.

Sam gapes, turning to Cas once Dean finally wraps up the story in the way he's satisfied. "Holy crap, Cas, I didn't think you'd take my advice so literally."

Cas shifts his eyes away, staring at the far too many pies fanned out on the dinner table that they have started sharing and eating. He fidgets in his seat, looking so incredibly human, and somehow, even more so, like a human when they're nervous, or shy, or both.

"What advice?" Dean's eyes are on Sam, then flick to Cas, staring at the angel. "Wait, are you... blushing?"

"No," Cas says bluntly.

Dean laughs, turning back to Sam, figuring his brother might be an easier target for grilling. "Alright, spill. What is it you guys talked about behind my back? Some secret plotting? What? Don't make me have to smash the pie on your face."

Sam raises up two hands in surrender. "Cas asked me what people usually do to a date. I swear, that's his words. And I thought, 'Finally.'"

"What did you say?" Dean swallows, asking, pointedly ignoring the sound of stifled laugh bubbling in Sam's chest.

"I told him people usually take their date to fine restaurants if they want to impress them. And if that someone is you, then make sure there is a nice piece of pie. Just a friendly advice," Sam says innocently.

"A fine restaurant and some pie -- and Cas took me to ancient Egypt to get a royal feast and supposedly the best pie ever existed in the universe across all time and space." Dean moans. "That is so Cas."

Sam chuckles loudly. So does Eileen.

Cas blushes harder. "I only wish to give you the best of everything possible."

Dean stares at the side of the angel's face, reaching out a hand to place his fingers on his cheek, making the angel look at him. "Yeah, I can see that."

A pause, then, with realization, "So it *was* planned. No wonder I thought the whole cover story was so much better than, you know, your average FBI performance."

Cas murmurs, "But the God of War and all the fighting were never part of the plan. I'm still sorry for putting you in danger."

Dean shakes his head slightly. "Hey, it's okay. The God of Pie wasn't part of the plan either, I bet, but I'm not complaining. Can't be a proper date if there's no fighting, don't you say?"

His thumb caresses the corner of Cas's lips, eyes dropping to where his fingers are drawing.

Cas blinks at the word "date", almost looking startled at the surprise.

Dean laughs, leaning in slowly. "But next time, let me pick the restaurant, deal?"

Cas hurries a nod, lowering his eyes to Dean's lips as he moves closer.

The room is so quiet now. They don't realize since when Sam and Eileen have left.

The air between them buzzes too hot.

Dean closes the last distance between them, pressing his forehead against Cas's, their noses brushing, lips inches away. Their breath huff onto each other's face.

Dean tells him, because he has to say it: "All things considered, that's still the best date I've ever had. Just want you to know that, Cas. Oh, and, they are wrong. The best creation ever existed? That's not any pie, Cas, that's you."

"So are you, Dean," Cas breathes.

And finally, Dean presses his lips on those he's been thinking about since four thousand years ago and longer. Since the beginning of time. Since forever.

Cas kisses him back just as eagerly.

They both taste like pie.

**END**

After-work notes:

Disclaimer: Please go easy on fact-checking the history part, I did a little research on pie's history and Egypt stuff (meaning: googled a few things and read some wiki pages), and that's about all I know. The rest gaps in knowledge are all filled in with pure imagination -- which means probably all full of random nonsense, all just for the sake of the story.

Fun fact: 1991 BC is indeed the year Amenemhat I took over the power from Mentuhotep IV, and Egypt went from the Eleventh to the Twelfth Dynasty, opening the most vigorous, flourishing era in ancient Egyptian history, the apex of the Middle Kingdom.

Another curious little detail: The reign of Mentuhotep IV is also referred to as the "Seven Empty Years," for the lack of records or historical resources, leaving just a perfect opening for some supernatural fill-in.

And, if anyone is interested enough to look up the names of the mentioned Egyptian woman and the vizier, or notices some casual little details in the passing lines, there hides another small romantic side story.
