According to the script and deleted scenes of 4x1 *Lazarus Rising*, the very first time Dean meets Cas, he'd already make improper jokes about being a womanizer.

This is in both the original screenplay and the deleted scene:

> **Castiel:** Finding a human vessel durable enough to contain me... it's not easy.
>
> **Dean:** I have that same problem with women.

AND THEY CUT IT OUT.

The whole deleted act in 4x1 is basically to cut this out.

They reshoot the whole last scene, just so Dean DOESN'T say that sentence, that witty comment.

I wonder if they did it because they realized, immediately after Jensen and Misha start working together, looking at each other's eyes so intently, Dean and Cas just can't look away from each other -- there is no way Dean can keep up flirting and making light jokes about females at that moment. That's the moment they realize, holy moly Dean is falling, and Cas is falling, and the joke is just not gonna work, and Dean is not going to be able to think about any woman when Cas is there.

They KNOW there is something going on between Dean and Cas, very likely purely because of Jensen and Misha, that the chemistry is there, the bond is there, the LOVE is RIGHT THERE.

The writers and editors and directors and producers, all the staff working on it before the final cut is out, everyone in the room, THEY KNOW, EVER SINCE THEY FIRST MET. BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

They fall for each other right from the beginning.
