Holy, this isn't my first time reading "The Happy Prince," probably not even the first five times. How come this is the first time realizing how fitting it is for destiel. The storyline is almost exactly like how destiel develops over the years.

The Happy Prince statue is Dean, the Swallow is Cas.

> "I am waited for in Egypt," said the Swallow. "My friends are flying up and down the Nile,..."
>
> "Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger?"
>
> (there is a poor woman and her sick kid need help)
>
> The Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry. "It is very cold here," he said; "but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger."

> "To-night I go to Egypt," said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect.
>
> "Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "will you not stay with me one night longer?"
>
> "I am waited for in Egypt," answered the Swallow.
>
> "Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, (there is a poor student need help)
>
> "I will wait with you one night longer," said the Swallow.

> "I am going to Egypt!" "I am come to bid you good-bye," he cried.
>
> "Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "will you not stay with me one night longer?"
>
> (there is a poor match-girl need help)
>
> "I will stay with you one night longer," said the Swallow.

Swallow flies from far away and is going to fly to Egypt for the winter. This city, the city the Prince is in just so happened to be a stop in his flight, he merely passed it by for the night. Every single day, he talks about he's going to leave, and every single day, the Prince asks him to stay. And every single day, he stayed for him.

Isn't it just like early season Dean's prayers. Before they are close enough, before they're friends. Cas is just following his orders, and Dean, Dean would ask for his help. And every time, Cas stayed for him, helped him, do what he said -- saving the city with the witch, telling him way to fight last sigil.

<br>

Even when what Dean asked is hurting himself, even when Cas never want to hurt him, if the world needs it --  needs him, his life, his blood, his everything, Dean would ask, and Cas does what he asks of him.

> "I have no ruby now," said the Prince; "my eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare sapphires,..."
>
> "Dear Prince," said the Swallow, "I cannot do that"; and he began to weep.
>
> "Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "do as I command you."
>
> So the Swallow plucked out the Prince's eye, and flew away to the student's garret.

> "Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her," said the Happy Prince.
>
> said the Swallow, "but I cannot pluck out your eye. You would be quite blind then."
>
> "Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "do as I command you."
>
> So he plucked out the Prince's other eye, and darted down with it.

"I won't hurt Dean." "You will. You are." (S08E17)

"Cas, I need you to promise me something. If I do go dark side, you got to take me out. Knife me. Smite me. Throw me in the freakin' sun, whatever." (S10E09)

and so many other times of self-sacrificing world-saving moments, carrying the soul bomb to Darkness

Replace each of the calling of "Swallow" with "Cas", what the Prince is saying is all exactly Dean's: "Cas, pluck my eyes out to save those people."

And Cas, he can't, he doesn't want, he would do everything he can to throw himself in before Dean jumping in, but even he can't stop all Dean's self-sacrifice attempts. Yet he'd still offer: "I could go with you." (S11E23)

"I do everything that you ask. I always come when you call. Has anyone but your closest kin ever done more for you?" (S06E21)

<br>

For the first three days, the Swallow stays because the Prince asks him. And after that, he stays because he wants to stay, because he wants to be with him. Even if the cost is his life.

> (as soon as he gives the eye sapphire to the match-girl)
>
> Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. "You are blind now," he said, "so I will stay with you always."
>
> "No, little Swallow," said the poor Prince, "you must go away to Egypt."
>
> "I will stay with you always," said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.

Cas would choose him always. He gives up a whole army for him. "You have to choose, us or them." (Naomi, S08E17) and he breaks free from the control to not hurt him, to save him.

He misses home like the Swallow with Egypt. He's an angel and Heaven was his home for eons, how can he not miss there. "You ever miss it? Upstairs? I mean, don't get me wrong. I love Earth. But it's not home, is it?" "Don't believe I'm welcome in Heaven." (Kelvin, S12E15) Cas did that whole colt and killing Dagon thing with the angel pitching about  going back Heaven, he did it for a different reason, for Dean still, but he didn't exactly answer or deny that question "Did you miss it" either. Still, regardless, he chooses to stay.

Even if now it's the Prince's term to urge him "You must go away to Egypt," for the Happy Prince without his eyes and the ruby already became poor Prince. Is the Prince starting to thinking he's not worthy of the Swallow's love anymore?

But he should know, the Swallow stays longer, and talks to him more. tells him all the stories of all the places he's never been or seen, about Egypt, about people in the city.

They talk, they spend the days and nights together, they help the people in the city one by one. Like they save the world together over and over again, year after year.

> Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor.

War after war, fight after fight, till they both grow old and gruff, weathered and worn. Powers fading. Aged, tired, worried, concerned.

They fight against the world to stay with each other, but the world is cruel. The winter for the Swallow, the aging for Dean, power fading for Cas.

The first encounter is season 4, the spending time together saving the world is all the seasons in between, and now, we are closing to season 15.

> Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.
>
> The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well.
>
> But at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once more. "Good-bye, dear Prince!" he murmured, "will you let me kiss your hand?"
>
> "I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow," said the Prince, "you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you."
>
> "It is not to Egypt that I am going," said the Swallow. "I am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?"
>
> And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.
>
> At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.

The confession scene. The S15E18 dungeon. The love and death happening in the same time scene. The happiest and saddest moment.

"Will you let me kiss your hand?" the Swallow doesn't even dare to ask for the lips, or to say the love, for he knows he's dying. And it is the Prince who are brave enough to say "you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you."

The Prince must be thinking if the Swallow finally decides to leave him to save his own life, to go to warm place, and this farewell is very well be the last chance they meet -- as a statue, he's not beautiful anymore, so he must know he'd be torn down shortly. So he's dying.

And the Swallowing is dying too.

Only in death can they confess.

"She's gonna kill you, and then she's gonna kill me."

And in this last moment of both their lives, they finally kissed -- if only Dean has more than one second, he would too. He must.

And the Swallow died. Right in front of his eyes.

There is the sound of a leaden heart cracking.

That's what happening to Dean too, when he sits in the dungeon floor, staring at the empty air where Cas was taken. There is the sound of a heart breaking.

The love. Saying good-bye and saying love.

"Why does this sound like a goodbye?" "Because it is."

"Don't do this, Cas." "Goodbye, Dean."

It is the same with the Swallow and the Prince, as it is with them.

<br>

But not even that is the real, eventual ending.

> "This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace. We must throw it away." So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying.

Swallow's body, side by side with the Prince's broken lead heart that refuses melt even in the fire and heat, lying together.

It almost sounds like burning their bodies and spreading the ashes together.

If they have the choice, and if they have ash to spread, that must be something they'd do.

Dean did that once, picking a nice beautiful place for Cas's ashes (S13E01), and Cas must will do the same if he's there when Dean's mortal life comes to an end (S15E20). And imagine they both have ashes, their mutual friends and family must will do the same, for it is the only right thing to do.

> "Bring me the two most precious things in the city," said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.
>
> "You have rightly chosen," said God, "for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me."

Even death isn't the final end.

There is a God and Angels for the Swallow and the Prince, as it is for Dean and Cas. There are Garden of Paradise and City of Gold.

Just like Dean going to Heaven, living (singing) for evermore. And Cas would be right there with him (less about praising the God, more about praising the Prince).

At least, after all the love and confession and death and goodbye, there are still hope that they'd meet again, and wherever they are, that bond and love would still be there.

It's a fairy tale, it's a love story.

They are just the same story told in two ways, *Supernatural* is exactly *The Happy Prince*.

<br>

Oscar Wilde really knows how to write love, for he loved. And knows exactly how it feels to love someone, falling for them, dying for them, throwing away your life for them. How much you're willing to sacrifice is ultimately how much you love. They love with their world and their life. And Oscar Wilde, is really one of the very few in real life actually love just like his characters and stories would love. Who can write a better story than that?

I wonder how it'd be like if he gets to write for SPN.
