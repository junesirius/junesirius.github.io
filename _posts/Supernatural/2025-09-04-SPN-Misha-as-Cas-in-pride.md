Ok I'm gonna say something people might not like to hear, but I need to be honest with myself.

First of all,

I love Misha.

I love Castiel.

I love pride.

I'm LGBTQ myself.

I can totally understand why Misha did it and appreciate that it's his gesture of support.

But I don't feel comfortable that he dressed up as Castiel to participate in real-world events like that.

And here is why --

He **acts as** Castiel. But he **is not** Castiel.

He can have his understanding of Cas and share his thoughts with us. But he **does not own** Cas.

He can't force us to believe what Cas would or would not do in the real-life world outside the TV show. (Even if I have no issue believing Cas may indeed participate in pride marches, it doesn't matter, it's not the point.)

The point that bothers me, is that it feels a hell lot like he's **abusing** the image of Cas. More than he has the right amount of right or boundary to.

It already bothered me a little that in some conventions, he has a specific photo booth that is noted he'd dress up as Cas for the photo op. But also noted the benefit of those photo ops goes to charity, so I can sorta give it a pass.

I can *try* to ease my uneasiness by persuading myself that parading as Cas is also a similar-to-charity sort of kindness act; it's so much better than trying to make some benefit out of the character and the costume. So I can still forgive him and continue loving him and Cas.

But the issue is like a "Good slave owner" kind of situation. I'm paraphrasing it from some old reasoning philosophy that I read when I was small and never forgot ever since -- just because the master is being kind and nice, it doesn't mean the slavery is acceptable. **Not being mistreated or misused doesn't mean freedom. It's still not right. And it could so easily go wrong, or go too far.**

And in this analogy, I feel like Castiel is being abducted. Cas is forced to present in the real world outside the TV show world, and participate in activities without his permission. Even if Misha's intention is good. Even if Cas would probably approve. The whole mix-up of character and reality doesn't feel right.

It's also different from fans dressing up as Cas (which wouldn't make me uncomfortable at all). Because of Misha's special role of being Cas's actor, he has a stronger image and hold of Cas. Which requires him to be more cautious when speaking in Cas's voice. And I'm given the impression that he's using it more than he should. It's almost like he's pretending to be someone he's not.

On a slightly more vicious note, it can also be misinterpreted that, by parading as Castiel, Misha manages to hide his own image behind the image of Castiel, so that the voice becomes the angel that is a part of the queer community supporting the community, but he doesn't say it for himself. I know he does, in general, he voiced his support in multiple other situations, but in this one particularly, because of the costume, his support as Misha, a straight man (as he claimed), is not voicing out for the community. He's "safer" and more distant for himself, in that regard. Which could be interpreted as a kind of cowardness.

I'm very likely overthinking. And I would guess it's not a popular thought among the fandom and fans of Cas and/or Misha. But if I'm not feeling entirely comfortable about this, I would guess someone else might feel the same way. I have to say it.

Thanks for listening to me if you read this far. Really, I mean it, thank you.
