Dean lies in the dark, staring at the ceiling of his room. He doesn't check the time, but the moon must be high now. The shades keep the room dark.

His father snores lightly in the next room. His brother breathes evenly, easier than when he's awake.

There are faint sounds of frogs croaking in the distance, probably somewhere near the farmland.

Dean listens to the symphony of the night with opened eyes, wide awake. It's actually quiet and calm -- peaceful, even. But his mind keeps slipping to that high pitch sound, for some reason it seems to have stuck in his mind. That must be the true voice of the angel, he thinks. There was an angel in the city today, and then he was gone, if his father was telling the truth.

Dean sits up in his bed quietly. But his father might not be telling the truth.

He sneaks out of the door without a sound, closing it carefully behind him.

The street is empty, the night air fresh. The moon is bright and round, hanging right over his head, shining the road silvery. He follows the road leading to the city square.

There is nothing there.

Whatever he's been expecting to see, whatever he's been bracing himself to prepare for, there is nothing to find. No sign of destruction, no sign of divinity, no sign of what the men of the city had done to the angel, for there is no sign of the angel at all.

He lingers around the square aimlessly, then starts wandering along the street. There is no high-pitched angel sound anywhere, even if he walks close to the houses, tilting his head to listen carefully inside. The angel has disappeared, as if it never has arrived in the city.

He pauses at the door of his house for a moment, hesitating. From where he stands, Dean can see their neighbor Martin's house, bigger and taller than theirs, having two floors rather than one, the kind that can host a fancy guest room and a luxurious well-equipped underground cellar. He can almost practically smell the corruption and hedonism from this distance.

He does not go into his own house.

His feet take him away, leading him to the gate of the city. He can't leave the city because his family is here, but he can stand at the gate, looking outside. As if the air here is cleaner than inside.

He sits by the gate of the city until the dawn breaks.

Dean blinks slowly as the night sky shift slowly to brighter color, the dark blue dyed over by golden cloud from the east. The sun rises over the horizon.

There is another source of light approaching slowly from the west. Accompanied by a crackling sound of thunder that sounds coming from above the sky. A figure walks toward the gate from far distance.

The land outside the gate is flat with desert, muffling the image of the figure with slowly flying sand.

Dean squints at the coming figure, wondering who might be coming toward the city today. He stands up by the gate, smoothing his cloth, waiting for the newcomer.

The man walks faster than Dean expects, or maybe he isn't walking, not really. He is also no ordinary man, for when he enters the clear view, Dean can see three pairs of wings attached on his back. Black as midnight, spreading wide when he first landed on the ground, folding behind his back as he walks closer.

Dean can't help himself staring.

"You're an angel." He hears himself saying, through his gaped mouth. His brain falls blank, knowing nothing else to do but staring at the newcomer.

He wears a long black tunic, with a tan linen robe on the outside, much like the men in the city. Minus the wings, Dean wouldn't know he isn't local just from the dressing. But somehow, these clothes seem quite fitting on him. Dean finds his eyes sliding to the belt tightens on his waist, displaying a well-built figure. He pulls his eyes back.

"I am Castiel, an Angel of the Lord." The angel announces with a low voice, looking at Dean bluntly without blinking.

"I'm Dean, Son of John, Brother of Sam." Dean tells him nervously, running directly into that pair of intense eyes, feeling his skin start crawling, but he holds the gaze.

"Are you a citizen of Sodom?" Castiel asks him sternly.

"Yes, born and raised, for two decades." Dean nods uneasily, almost ashamed of admitting his connection to this city. He swallows, troubled by the querying look in the angel's eyes. His fingers fidget around the skirt of his own tunic, his eyes shift between Castiel's eyes, lips and the wings behind him.

"Then you shall lead the way, for I bear the order of inspecting the city." Castiel looks over his shoulder, at the city behind the gate.

The sun has risen, the city is wakening to a bright morning. The men of the city walk onto the street, the cheerful mundane chatters buzzing in the air.

Dean half turns, following his gaze, seeing what he's looking at. "Are you not here rescuing the angel visited yesterday?" He blurts out.

Castiel pulls his gaze back onto Dean's face with more focus. "Rescue? Why would an angel require rescue from a city of mankind?" Castiel raises his eyebrows.

"You don't know men of Sodom, I do. They're not... friendly, to the outsiders, especially angels." Dean lowers his voice, glancing nervously behind him, slowing down whenever one standing too close to the gate where they might be overheard. His heart pounds rapidly inside his chest. "They are ruthless. I don't know what happened to the angel came yesterday, but I heard him screaming. I fear the worst has happened."

Dean swallows hard, searching Castiel's face, looking for a sign of moving but fail to find one. "Please don't go into the city. If you have to, you can stay in my house. You will be safe as long as my father is not there. My brother is kind."

"No." Castiel looks at him straight, and says plainly, "Your offer is appreciated, yet that shall not be necessary. I will go to the square, and announce my arrival to the people of the city. My safety will not be of concern, for I am a warrior in my garrison, I had fought evil from Hell. No mankind would be equivalent." He raises his chin slightly with pride.

Dean frowns deeply. "But you've never been to Sodom. Those people are strong, have built powerful weapons. I don't want any more angels get hurt --"

Castiel waves him off, "I have decided. Now I shall go to the square to fulfill my order."

"Then at least allow me be with you during your stay," Dean says quickly. "I'm familiar with the city. I can be your guide."

Castiel considers briefly and agrees, "So be it."

<br>

They are noticed by people the moment they walk past the gate. In fact, Dean suspects they might have already caught attention when they were having that vain argument of a discussion that he failed to turn the angel aside.

Now that they walk onto the street, with Dean leading half a step ahead and the angel having his wings tucking behind his back, Dean has never been so conscious of his own existence. People stop what they were doing to turn and look at them. Their eyes land meaningfully on them, lingering between him and Castiel. He doesn't need to meet any of their eyes to know the way they're looking -- the gleeful looks of predators. He picks up the pace.

More people drop what they were busy with, and starts following them from a short distance away, forming a tailing crowd fast.

"Dean!" One of them calls to him, "Where do you find an angel over the night and where are you going? Don't keep him to yourself. Introduce him to us so we may know him!"

A loud laughter and yelling of agreement burst from the crowd.

Dean shoots a flustered glare behind his shoulder, decidedly ignoring them, urging Castiel under his breath to speed up. The angel merely observes them with thinned lips and disapproving frowns, not saying a thing.

They almost pass through his house when Dean spots his father standing at the door, holding his arms. The look in his eyes is outrageous, burning with fury. Dean's blood freezes to ice.

He hears John's voice before he reaches the doorsteps.

"Where have you been?!" John shouts at him, "Your brother could be dying when you're having fun with an angel! Sneaking out in the middle of the night like that!"

Dean stops automatically with a gasp, "Sam's dying? He seemed fine last night."

"He would if you don't get your lazy ass over here and prepare his meds! We're running out of herbs, so go get those for him." John orders.

Dean blinks, looking between John and Castiel, then turning back to his father, "The herbs are in the mountains. It will take me at least three days to go there and back." His voice deeply troubled.

"Then why aren't you leaving already?" John stares him down. "Surely you don't have anything more important to do?"

Dean swallows, glancing back at Castiel.

The crowds following them have already caught up, surrounding them with interested eyes witnessing the matter.

"Castiel --" Dean starts low and eagerly.

"Go," the angel answers him firmly. "I can see you have other responsibility. I shall carry on my task alone."

"Follow the street to the end and turn to the biggest road," Dean glances at Castiel, turning to him to point at the end of the road with his fingers, "that will take you to the center of the city, the square."

Castiel nods briefly with appreciation.

"Please be careful, Castiel," Dean lowers his voice so the people and his father might not hear him, his voice rushed with worry, "I will come back in three days."

"Farewell, Dean," the angel says formally.

They part ways.

Castiel walks along the street, Dean taking the opposite way heading to the mountains.

When he looks back, he can't see Castiel already -- the crowd following the angel is like a moving wall, covering all the views.

Dean thinks -- he wishes Castiel would be safe. And that he'll see the angel again.
