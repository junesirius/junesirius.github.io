## Draft

### Original Sodom story from Bible

(English Standard Version)

#### Genesis 13

##### Abram and Lot Separate

So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.

Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the Lord. And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.

Then Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left." And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other. Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord.

#### Genesis 13

Bera: King of Sodom, Birsha: King of Gomorrah, Shinab: King of Admah, Shemeber: King of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar)

#### Genesis 18

Then the Lord said, “Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave, I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know.”

##### Abraham Intercedes for Sodom

So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the Lord. Then Abraham drew near and said, "Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?" And the Lord said, "If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake."

Abraham answered and said, "Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes. Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?" And he said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there." Again he spoke to him and said, "Suppose forty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of forty I will not do it." Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there." He answered, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there." He said, "Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it." Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there." He answered, "For the sake of ten I will not destroy it." And the Lord went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

#### Genesis 19

##### God Rescues Lot

The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth and said, "My lords, please turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way." They said, "No; we will spend the night in the town square." But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house. And they called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them." Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him, and said, "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof." But they said, "Stand back!" And they said, "This fellow came to sojourn, and he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them." Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down. But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door. And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.

Then the men said to Lot, "Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place. For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy it." So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, "Up! Get out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city." But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.

As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city." But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the Lord being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city. And as they brought them out, one said, "Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away." And Lot said to them, "Oh, no, my lords. Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die. Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there—is it not a little one?—and my life will be saved!" He said to him, "Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there." Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

##### God Destroys Sodom

The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven. And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.

And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord. And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.

So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.

##### Lot and His Daughters

Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters. And the firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father." So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.

The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father." So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.

### Outline (1st version)

在索多玛蛾摩拉受折磨的天使（R级）

(inspired by 《[Clipped and Unbound](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1567589)》slaved angel world + ND_Tardis的《[罪恶之城](https://archiveofourown.org/works/19430962)》)

It's a city of blasphemy. When angels arrive, the humans here have ways to enslave and torture them. Cas comes with order to see if they are indeed as sinned as outcried and if so, punish them, end up being enslaved, torn and violated, locked down, distained. Dean is Lot in this story, the only moral righteous man, citizen of Sodom and Gomorrah, despise what his neighbors do to the angels, still have awe and faith for angels. Found Cas locked in his neighbor/father's cellar, quietly secretly try to help him, release him and help him heal himself. Cas has PTSD now and guarded against all humans, (almost/already?) hurt Dean (by accident), Dean doesn't complain, Cas feel guilty. Dean's father comes back find out, more pissed at Cas, torture/punish him more (Cas thinks he deserve this one, doesn't protest like he usually would), Dean heartbroken, thinking Cas is hurt more because of him, self-blame. John almost/want to kill Cas, Dean plead not to, has to make argument saying he should be the one to handle Cas since he's hurt by the angel, John agrees, leave him be. Cas actually thinks Dean is going to punish/torture/hurt/kill him, still doesn't protest and thinks he deserve it.

Dean open his lock/chain, Cas doesn't try to flee. Dean: "You are not going to leave?" Cas: "Where to?" He's already distained by human, he's dirty now, Heaven loathe any form related to human e.g. Nephilim, he doubts if heaven would still want him in.

Dean sad, Cas not understand, Dean apologize, Cas apologize back, they kiss, two wounded creature by the city of sins

God punish the city, going to destroy it, Cas hear it from angel radio, propose to take Dean away, leave the city, never look back again, Dean plead to bring Sam too, Cas agree, Dean can't find heart to ask Cas to take John too so he doesn't ask even if he know he will hate himself for it

The city is destroyed, Sam (too young to understand everything) worry about John, look back, turn into pillar of salt, Dean cry in agony, Cas self-blame he can't save Sam too, Dean doesn't blame him

Bal find Dean/Cas, has the heaven weapon in hand, empathy on Cas, mojo him clean, bring him to heaven, Cas offer Dean come to Heaven too, Dean choose live/travel alone then reincarnation (become Dean of canon verse), Cas gets "cleaned up" by Naomi (thus brainwashed, no memory, Bal remembers?)

then the two meet again in 401, feel familiar, neither remember, but somehow intuitively trust each other already; 603 run into the salt weapon again, Bal gives him a meaningful eye

### Claim

#### Claim Summary

Inspired by Genesis XIX, story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Dean's family are citizens of Sodom, a city where the villagers abuse and violate Angels. Dean is the only righteous man in the city.

Cas arrives in the city and gets mistreated, Dean wants to save him. The process of saving Cas from torture is slow, the two of them start getting closer and getting together. Dean's given the choice of saving Cas or saving the city. He chooses Cas in the end, with all the agony of having to make this decision, which ultimately deems him not righteous anymore.

The city is destroyed, Dean and Cas are moved out of the city. But it turns out to be a trial for Dean, it's Michael's plan of testing whether Dean's righteous enough or not, which turns out he's not ready. Michael puts him into reincarnation and tests him and waits for him for another four thousand years until the modern canon time, while Cas is taken to Naomi (to be brainwashed and have his memory wiped). So neither remembers the experience when they meet again in S4E01, but they trust and choose each other immediately again.

#### Visual

Cas is locked up by chains in a basement, enslaved, his wings broken, cloth torn, skin burned, very pitiful awful looking, has angel-proof carvings on the handcuffs and ground, holy oil circle around, blood distained, beaten up, very clearly has been violently violated, eyes panicked. Dean holds him tight and kisses him gently.

or

At some distance, the cities are burning, all flames and smoke. On a small hill, Dean and Cas are hugging and kissing. Cas is healed, his wings healthy and beautiful and spread out. Balthazar and Sam are around them, John is turned into a salt pillar facing the burning cities (not necessarily need to be depicted, just a note).

### Posting

#### Posting Summary

It is a land of sin and blasphemy. It is the city where Dean was born and lives. The city named Sodom.

It is a time when men hold no belief. It is the day the angel comes to the Earth. The angel named Castiel.

It is fate. It is choice.

The angel does not know what he is stepping into. The man does. And he tries so, so hard, to save him. Before they become the last righteous man and the last angel in the city that is sinned.

### Editing notes

when posting, before each chapter, quote something from Bible

~~Including/mention "Genesis XIX" in summary~~

use "Castiel" in first few chapters, change to "Cas" only after they get close and familiar

the angel in chap 1 Cas come to search is Amos (Old Testament) and she didn't survive (mention that in later chapters)

Dean has faith in angel/heaven in his 4ky ago version, gradually forgetting/losing faith until the current version doesn't even believe in angel

Dean warns him about people, wants him leave or only goes to his house, Cas doesn't listen, Dean follows, Cas gets noticed by the villagers immediately, Dean worries, but gets distracted/ordered away by John when passing by their house (Sam is sick), Dean has to leave taking care of Sam, Cas heads to city square alone, bearing people's eyes, Dean really worries (Dean mention his house/dad/Sam/neighbor in their talk)

#### Act 1

Dean shuts the door, but leaving it unlocked. He lowers the shades, too. The room falls into grey dimness. He lights the candles, placing them in the center of the dining table, shadowing the room with wavering light. There are baked unleavened bread on the desk, ready to serve.

It's not really night yet, outside. The sun is setting, the street in dusk is still busy with the men of the city, young and old. He knows every one of them -- Sodom isn't a big city, everyone knows everyone here. So whenever there is someone from outside comes to the city, all of them know.

The men of the city are heading to the square -- almost all of them, if they are not otherwise occupied. The sound from the street and outside are muffled, with the door and windows closed. But the sound from the square still sneaks in through the cracks -- loud, cheerful voices of men, and an undistinguishable, squeaky, high pitch.

Dean busies himself with cleaning the room, turning against the window.

The voices quiet down eventually. The uproar in the square recedes slowly.

"What's happening out there?" his young brother asks, lifting himself up from the bed, breathing heavily from the effort. He has been resting for the whole day until now, but he still looks pale and tired, coughing now and then. His young body is lean, his footsteps shaky on his way to sitting by the table.

Dean's not sure if it's the noise outside that woke Sam up or the lack of it. He rushes to give him a hand, supporting his weight.

"A newcomer arrived at the city earlier," he says simply, focusing on ensuring Sam sit steadily on the chair, pulling the basket of bread closer for him to reach.

"A merchant?" Sam takes a piece of bread, tearing it from one end, chewing slowly. He grimaces when he swallows, and then continues the next bite.

"An angel," Dean tells him.

"A real angel?" Sam looks up at him, eyes widening.

Dean shrugs slightly. "Don't think anyone would be interested in faking one," he says. "Not the first one in the city, probably not the last one either."

"Why aren't you out there then?" Sam asks, genuinely curious, if not a little confused.

"Why would I?" Dean asks plainly, edging away from their dining table, fidgeting in the kitchen to fill the wine and water bottle, facing away from the door and Sam.

Sam turns in the seat slightly to glance at the back of his brother, "Well, I believe everyone else is, and I bet Dad too."

"You don't know what they're doing to them out there." Dean says glumly, "And I hope you never would."

Sam opens his mouth, just in time for the door opens and their father walks in. His removed jacket hangs on his arms. He leaves it on the rack by the door, heading straight to kitchen to rinse his hands, passing by Dean.

"You look well today," John finishes up, sitting down at the table, checking Sam up.

"I feel better too," Sam nods, then asks, "How's the angel, Dad?"

"So you heard." John flashes a glance at Dean once quickly, "They are peculiar creatures. We did what we enjoy, and now we know him in every sense."

The word *"know"* has many meanings, and Dean knows well enough it's the worst kind in this sentence.

"Which is blasphemous and unmoral." Dean can't help himself snapping, bringing the wine and water bottle over, putting them down on the table with a little too much force. "It's not right."

"I see your brother is still the same, innocent and difficult." John says sourly, still facing Sam. "Morality has nothing to do here, neither is piety. How many times do I need to remind you: when in Sodom, do as Sodoms do. It's nothing wrong when everyone is doing the same."

"It still is," Dean sits down at the table bitterly. "Why can't we move out of this city? It's clearly sinned, I'm sure you can see that."

John shrugs nonchalantly, undisturbed in eating the food. "Sam is not well for travelling. And where do you suggest we go? Gomorrah? Why would we even go farther east when we have a good life here? You should feel lucky to have a place to live in this city, boy."

Dean swallows, lowering his head, defeated. He glances at the direction of the door, thinking of the high pitch he heard. The bread in his throat forms a lump, dry and cold. "Where is that angel now?"

John squints at him, eyes piercing through his skull, as if reading his mind. "Gone," he says decisively. "And don't you dare go get yourself into stupid trouble like interfering when our neighbors are doing what everyone always does around here. Those flying beings from the sky, they're nothing to us. They are no stronger than us, no more powerful than us. They can't get out of the cuffs we forge or the circles we draw, I see no reason to fear or worship or worry about them, you hear me?"

Dean can sense the burning gaze on his skull without looking up. He forces the lump in his throat down in a hard swallow.

Sam's eyes are on him too, waiting.

"Yes, sir." Dean forces himself to answer, voice quiet.

"Good," John nods approvingly.

The dinner continues in peace.

Sam clears his throat, "Is there any other news out there, Dad?"

"Leah gave birth to a boy. Many are surprised." John answers absentmindedly.

"Not her husband's, I presume?" Sam asks, voice natural, just slight curious. As if it's the most common thing to witness around here.

"Martin's," John says simply.

"Our neighbor Martin?" Sam chuckles, "He must have, what, at least four kids with four different women now?"

John gives him a look, "Like most of men in the city, yes. He has desires, so does all of us. There is no point in restraining what people enjoy to do."

Dean tunes out the rest of the conversation.

<br>

#### Act 2

Dean lies in the dark, staring at the ceiling of his room. He doesn't check the time, but the moon must be high now. The shades keep the room dark.

His father snores lightly in the next room. His brother breathes evenly, easier than when he's awake.

There are faint sounds of frogs croaking in the distance, probably somewhere near the farmland.

Dean listens to the symphony of the night with opened eyes, wide awake. It's actually quiet and calm -- peaceful, even. But his mind keeps slipping to that high pitch sound, for some reason it seems to have stuck in his mind. That must be the true voice of the angel, he thinks. There was an angel in the city today, and then he was gone, if his father was telling the truth.

Dean sits up in his bed quietly. But his father might not be telling the truth.

He sneaks out of the door without a sound, closing it carefully behind him.

The street is empty, the night air a little chilling but not cold. The moon is bright and round, hanging right over his head, shining the road silvery. He follows the road leading to the city square.

There is no angel there -- or any sign of one.

Whatever he's been expecting to see, whatever he's been bracing himself to prepare for, there is nothing to find. No sign of destruction, no sign of divinity, no sign of what the men of the city must had done to the angel. There is no sign of the angel at all.

He lingers around the square aimlessly, then starts wandering along the street. There is no high-pitched angel sound anywhere, even if he walks close to the houses, tilting his head to listen carefully inside. The angel has disappeared, as if it never has arrived in the city.

He pauses at the door of his house for a moment, hesitating. From where he stands, Dean can see their neighbor Martin's house, bigger and taller than theirs, having two floors rather than one, the kind that can host a fancy guest room and a luxurious well-equipped underground cellar. He can practically smell the corruption and hedonism from this distance.

He does not go into his own house.

His feet take him away, leading him to the gate of the city. He can't leave the city because his family is here, but he can stand at the gate, looking outside. As if the air here is cleaner than inside.

He sits by the gate of the city until the dawn breaks.

Dean blinks slowly as the night sky shift slowly to brighter color, the dark blue dyed over by golden cloud from the east. The sun rises over the horizon.

There is another source of light approaching slowly from the west. Accompanied by a crackling sound of thunder that sounds coming from above the sky. A figure walks toward the gate from far distance.

The land outside the gate is flat with desert, muffling the image of the figure with slowly flying sand.

Dean squints at the coming figure, wondering who might be coming toward the city today. He stands up by the gate, smoothing his cloth, waiting for the newcomer.

The man walks faster than Dean expects, or maybe he isn't walking, not really. He is also no ordinary man, for when he enters the clear view, Dean can see three pairs of wings attached on his back. Black as midnight, spreading wide when he first landed on the ground, folding behind his back as he walks closer.

Dean can't help himself staring.

"You're an angel." He hears himself saying, through his gaped mouth. His brain falls blank, knowing nothing else to do but staring at the newcomer.

He wears a long black tunic, with a tan linen robe on the outside, much like the men in the city. Minus the wings, Dean wouldn't know he isn't local just from the dressing. But somehow, these clothes seem quite fitting on him. Dean finds his eyes sliding to the belt tightened on his waist, displaying a well-built figure. He pulls his eyes back.

"I am Castiel, an Angel of the Lord." The angel announces with a low voice, looking at Dean bluntly without blinking.

"I'm Dean, Son of John, Brother of Sam." Dean tells him nervously, running directly into that pair of intense eyes, feeling his skin start crawling, but he holds the gaze.

"Are you a citizen of Sodom?" Castiel asks him directly.

"Yes, born and raised, for two decades." Dean nods uneasily, almost ashamed of admitting his connection to this city. He swallows, troubled by the querying look in the angel's eyes. His fingers fidget around the skirt of his own tunic, his eyes shift between Castiel's eyes, lips and the wings behind him.

"Then you shall lead the way, for I bear the order of inspecting the city." Castiel looks over his shoulder, at the city behind the gate.

The sun has risen, the city is wakening to a bright morning. The men of the city walk onto the street, the cheerful mundane chatters buzzing in the air.

Dean half turns, following his gaze, seeing what he's looking at. "Are you not here rescuing the angel visited yesterday?" He blurts out.

Castiel pulls his gaze back onto Dean's face with more focus. "Rescue? Why would an angel require rescue from a city of mankind?" He raises his eyebrows.

"You don't know men of Sodom, I do. They're not... friendly, to the outsiders, especially angels." Dean lowers his voice, glancing nervously behind him, slowing down whenever one standing too close to the gate where they might be overheard. His heart pounds rapidly inside his chest. "They are ruthless. I don't know what happened to the angel came yesterday, but I heard him screaming. I fear the worst has happened."

Dean swallows hard, searching Castiel's face, looking for a sign of moving but fail to find one. "Please don't go into the city. If you have to, you can stay in my house. You will be safe as long as my father is not there. My brother is kind."

"No." Castiel looks at him straight, and says plainly, "Your offer is appreciated, yet that shall not be necessary. I will go to the square, and announce my arrival to the people of the city. My safety will not be of concern, for I am a warrior in my garrison, I had fought evil from Hell. No mankind would be equivalent." He raises his chin slightly with pride.

Dean frowns deeply. "But you've never been to Sodom. Those people are strong, have built powerful weapons. I don't want any more angels get hurt --"

Castiel waves him off, "I have decided. Now I shall go to the square to fulfill my order."

"Then at least allow me be with you during your stay," Dean says quickly. "I'm familiar with the city. I can be your guide."

Castiel considers briefly and agrees, "So shall it be."

<br>

They are noticed by people the moment they walk past the gate. In fact, Dean suspects they might have already caught attention when they were having that vain argument of a discussion that he failed to turn the angel aside.

Now that they walk onto the street, with Dean leading half a step ahead and the angel having his wings tucking behind his back, Dean has never been so conscious of his own existence. People stop what they were doing to turn and look at them. Their eyes land meaningfully on them, lingering between him and Castiel. He doesn't need to meet any of their eyes to know the way they're looking -- the gleeful looks of predators, invasive, avid, like a group of hyenas. He picks up the pace.

More people drop what they were busy with, and starts following them from a short distance away, forming a tailing crowd fast.

"Dean!" One of them calls to him, "Where do you find an angel over the night and where are you going? Don't keep him to yourself. Introduce him to us so we may know him!"

A loud laughter and yelling of agreement burst from the crowd.

Dean shoots a flustered glare behind his shoulder, decidedly ignoring them, urging Castiel under his breath to speed up. The angel merely observes them with thinned lips and disapproving frowns, not saying a thing.

They almost pass through his house when Dean spots his father standing at the door, holding his arms. The look in his eyes is outrageous, burning with fury. Dean's blood freezes to ice.

He hears John's voice before he reaches the doorsteps.

"Where have you been?!" John shouts at him, "Your brother could be dying when you're having fun with an angel! Sneaking out in the middle of the night like that!"

Dean stops automatically with a gasp, "Sam's dying? He seemed fine last night."

"He would if you don't get your lazy ass over here and prepare his meds! We're running out of herbs, so go get those for him." John orders.

Dean blinks, looking between John and Castiel, then turning back to his father, "The herbs are in the mountains. It will take me at least three days to go there and back." His voice deeply troubled.

"Then why aren't you leaving already?" John stares him down. "Surely you don't have anything more important to do?"

Dean swallows, glancing back at Castiel.

The crowds following them have already caught up, surrounding them with interested eyes witnessing the matter.

"Castiel --" Dean starts low and eagerly.

"Go," the angel answers him firmly. "I can see you have other responsibility. I shall carry on my task alone."

"Follow the street to the end and turn to the biggest road," Dean glances at Castiel, turning to him to point at the end of the road with his fingers, "that will take you to the center of the city, the square."

Castiel nods briefly with appreciation.

"Please be careful, Castiel," Dean lowers his voice so the people and his father might not hear him, his voice rushed with worry, "I will come back in three days."

"Farewell, Dean," the angel says formally.

They part ways.

Castiel walks along the street, Dean takes the opposite way heading to the mountains.

When he looks back, he can't see Castiel already -- the crowd following the angel is like a moving wall, covering all the views, not leaving a single glimpse of his wings.

Dean thinks -- he wishes Castiel would be safe. And that he'll see the angel again.

#### draft notes

people of Sodom is strong, powerful enough to confine angels, has angel-proofing weapons/handcuffs and holy oil

Dean is the only moral righteous man, young, citizen of Sodom, despise what his neighbors do to the angels, still have awe and faith for angels.

Cas comes with order to see if they are indeed as sinned as the outcries and if so punish them (and to find the other missing angel Amos, member of his garrison)

they don't get to choose where to be born

Dean is forced to do nothing about the missing/hurt angel the previous day, even if he protested/tried to find him, he hates it for himself

Dean can hear angel true voice, already a surprise to Cas/most angels/men

Dean start unknowingly praying and Cas start able to hear him through prayer

the way Cas speaks, start off very formal, biblical style, slowly turning to normal verbal Dean style sentences

(Sam 17y, Dean 21y)

### (Chap 2) II. Find the Angel

> Dean comes back out after three days (Sam doesn't get better but stabled, he goes to get meds), goes to the city square, Cas is gone, Dean only finds broken feathers and blood and lingering grace, people laughing talking about new angel, Dean heart hurt, find a vial to collect Cas's lost grace
>
> Dean starts looking for the angel, hoping it's not too late, doesn't dare asking around for fear they know they're close, notice signs of Cas's appearance and grace and cloth pieces here and there, torn trench coats etc., imagining the worst already

### (Chap 3) III. Raggedy Doll

> neighbor calls for helpers to constrain Cas again and beat him up even worse, torture/punish him more, Cas doesn't protest like used to (bc he thinks he deserves this one), Dean protests and claims he's fine but gets ignored (heartbroken, think Cas is hurt more bc of him, self-blame)
>
> neighbor calls for John, John comes to take Dean home, Dean doesn't want to leave Cas behind, argues blood for blood, he should be the one to decide how to punish Cas bc he's hurt by him.
>
> John discuss/trade with neighbor, takes enslaved Cas home with them, throw him into the cellar/dungeon, give Dean knife and let him go in there alone, silently suggested he can do anything to Cas like the way everyone does, violate him then kill him, that's all okay, only need to let John know once Dean's done (John thinks that's why Dean insists to have him)
>

<br>

#### draft notes

### (Chap 5) V. The Sins

> Dean opens Cas's lock/chain, Cas doesn't try to escape. Dean: "You're not going to leave?" Cas: "Where to?" Cas thinks he's already distained by human, he's dirty now, Heaven loathes any form distained by human, e.g. Nephilim, he doubts if Heaven would still want him in, or he can make wings heal to good again to fly back to Heaven. (during torture, some/a lot of his grace is drained, wound on the neck)
>
> Dean sad, Cas not understand, talk a bit more. Dean apologizes for human race as a whole for hurting angels, hurting Cas specifically. Cas surprised Dean still believes in angel even tho no one here does anymore, appear to care about him. Dean talks about Mom and Sam, what he thinks should be the right way to live, upset and powerless about his neighbors, he's only still here for Sam. Cas amazed there is still at least one righteous man left in the city, regain hope at humanity
>
> Dean apologize again as himself, for bringing Cas more pain than before. Cas apologize for hurting him, uses the first bit of grace he recovers to heal Dean instead of himself, thank him for taking him away from other brutal humans. Dean wishes he can do more to help Cas, Cas says there is, and start kissing Dean, Dean kisses back (tapping into Dean's soul energy in intimate moment to recharge grace quickly). Two wounded little creatures in the city of sins holding onto each other.
>
> Dean unintentionally shows some sexual tendency/desire on Cas during kiss, e.g. frottage. Cas startled, pull away immediately, trauma violation triggered. Dean regret immediately, apologize, hurry out of the room

<br>

### (Chap 6) VI. The Brother and the Father

> Dean has to find excuses everyday to explain to John why he's not killing Cas yet, lie that he's torturing Cas to let him pay so John doesn't get suspicious, John proud he's getting better at torturing. Sam knows he's lying, secretly ask why Dean doesn't tell John truth but Dean too resigned to confront John.
>
> Sam wants to meet Cas, Dean doesn't think Cas's ready/well enough, afraid he'd be triggered by stranger and start attacking again.
>
> Sam still weak from some sickness, not fully recovered. John suggests Dean taking Cas's grace to feed Sam to see if it can help, Dean doesn't want, John: "You value that thing more than your own brother?" Dean hates it puts him in choice. avoid Cas more. (Sam talks to him some, suggest support him either way, Sam attitude neutral indifferent to angels)
>
> Dean doesn't interact much with Cas after that hurried leave, avoid him, afraid getting things worse, except for continue providing food/water/bandage/vial with his grace, giving Cas space, hoping him recover by himself. sometimes secretly observe Cas from entrance, want to talk but doesn't know how to, watch Cas facing small window watching sky, think Cas doesn't know he's observing him. Cas actually notices

<br>

### (Chap 7) VII. The Wings

> Cas calls Dean before he can leave secretly again. Dean enters, keeps distance, self-aware, afraid of hurting Cas accidentally again, mentally or physically. Cas sees it, reaches to kiss Dean. Dean reciprocates, but: "Does it help?" Cas raises eyebrow, Dean was thinking the kiss is only for tapping his soul to help Cas recharge and heal. Cas sighs and tells him how different he is to anyone else and that he hears conversations upstairs, Dean doesn't need to fear to hurt him, except for the sexual activities that he's not ready again.
>
> Cas's wings are healing, Dean caresses the feathers, awed, love it, more ashamed for other sinned humans, ashamed of himself too for thinking of hurting Cas to save Sam, want to save Sam and everyone.

<br>

### (Chap 8) VIII. Punishment of the City

> Cas meet Sam first time, diagnose him, mojo heal him. Sam start thank/appreciate angels too, asks Cas's initial mission 
>
> Cas shares the original plan/his order: as soon as his wings recover enough, he'd go back report his experience and the city will be determined whether worth saving, if not then destroyed. Dean worry, Cas promise will save him and Sam, Dean still want to save everyone, Cas irritated a little, they argue slightly, raise voice, afraid of being found (already noticed by John actually), Dean rushes out unhappily, wants to prove to Cas people in Sodom can change/still be saved (want to say Sam is example but not strong enough)

<br>

### (Chap 9) IX. The Last Angel

> outside, Dean talks with Sam about God's plan to destroy Sodom as soon as Cas recovers and goes back to report, wants Sam's support to prove people can be changed/saved, Sam is neutral friendly but too reasonable so unsure they still can be saved. The conversation is overheard by John, more determined to kill Cas immediately.
>
> Dean tries to stop John from going to cellar but fails, John confronts Cas, they fight, John uses some Sodom magic/power to overpower still wounded/weak Cas (sth showed in Chap 1), Dean jumps in to protect Cas, get wounded in the fight accidentally (not sure John's or Cas's, likely John's), Sam tries very hard to pull John away but can't
>
> Cas distracted by Dean's wound, John severely stabs Cas and almost kills him, threaten to throw him out to let all neighbors know he's here and do what did to him again, Dean first time attacks John, knocks him out. Cas thinks he's dying for sure this time, confesses to Dean, Dean cries, reciprocates, kisses, Cas closes his eyes, grace dimming, Cas last words: "If the city is worth saving, it would be because of you"

<br>

### (Chap 10) X. The Last Righteous Man

> Dean desperate, first time pray to God and other angels, thinks Cas doesn't deserve that. Bal answers, says Upstairs (God isn't there, it's Michael in charge) already decides to destroy city (Cas doesn't report back is proof enough), just wait for Dean to leave the city (Michael promised Abraham to save righteous men in the city, actually bc Dean's his vessel)
>
> Dean insists Bal to resurrect Cas, Bal makes it a deal: he can save Cas but Dean has to leave city (Sodom dies) or Dean stays and Cas dies (Sodom lives). Either way, Dean lives. Bal: "You said Sodom is worth saving, but everything comes with a price. Are those corrupted people out there who did this to him, worth his life? Are you going to exchange his life, for those ingratitude sinners?"
>
> Dean torn apart, cries hard, painful decision, refuse to choose either, too painful, start cursing angels/Heaven/God again, lost faith in angel/Heaven here, start getting angry and vicious, act as not care about saving the world again, counter proposal of killing himself and same both but not an option, eventually choose Cas
>
> high-pitch sound drops in, Michael speaks to Bal directly, Bal listens with pale face

<br>

### (Chap 11) XI. Save the Angel

> Bal gets scolded by Michael directly (for forcing Dean lose faith), terrified solemn face, drop joke face, resurrects Cas, mojos him clean, fixes his wings and other unseen tears, murmurs by his ear then disappears
>
> Cas/Dean hug/kiss, Dean cries again, Cas looks at him sad. Dean asks what Bal said, Cas says Bal went off preparing for the weapon to destroy the city like they planned, but by choosing Cas and condemn the city, Dean isn't righteous man anymore, they're allowed to destroy the city with him in it. Dean: "He did say 'Everything comes with a price'", thinks it means he'd have to die, he doesn't regret choose to save Cas
>
> fire and sulphur start dropping into city, Cas makes his decision, disobeys order, offers to fly Dean/Sam out of city. Dean doesn't think he deserves anymore, Cas: "You always deserve saving." Sam pleads to bring John too, Cas thins lips, Dean doesn't know if he'd be happy about it, Cas warns them not to look back and flies them to Zoar

<br>

### (Chap 12) XII. Save the Righteous Man

> they can feel the fire heat from the burning cities (more than just Sodom, Gomorrah too, and Admah, Zeboiim), have to force themselves to not turn back to watch, Cas use wing to protect Sam/Dean's eyes. Cas stands there with them. John wakes up, turns to watch, becomes pillar of salt. Dean stares, unsure of how he feels. Sam just stares, Cas watches Dean in silence, as if wait for his orders
>
> Bal comes back with the salt weapon in hand. Cas: "You don't have to do that" Bal: "Order from Upstairs. (to Dean) You feel better?" (Michael's friendly gesture trying to earn Dean's faith back) Dean: "Not really. What now?" what's him and Sam gonna do alone in this world, with everyone they know destroyed
>
> Cas/Bal change look, Sam to Cas: "What you told us, that's not what all he told you, isn't it?" Bal to Cas: "Of course not, or it won't be secret. Unless you're ready." Dean: "Ready for what?" Cas to Dean: "You saved my life, so now we share a profound bond, I'll be watching over you for all my existence."
>
> Cas needs to go back to Heaven, Bal says Naomi requests to see him. Cas offers Dean come to Heaven too, Dean chooses to stay behind continue living/traveling in the world, wait to go to Heaven after he's done.
>
> Bal: "That's not an option either" he's not gonna go to Heaven after dead, he'll go into next reincarnation, bc Michael thinks he's not ready yet, it's like a training process. the decision he made shows he's not ready yet. Dean: "Then when is ready?" Bal: "In a few thousand years, we have some big plans. Spoilers. But it's a long time, don't have to worry now, go enjoy your boring monkey life, you have a few thousand years to kill."
>
> Dean to Cas: "Will I ever see you again?" Cas: "You will, I promise." Dean: "But I wouldn't remember you, would I? Everything we went through here, everything I did. I'll forget." Cas (small sad smile): "No, but it's okay." Dean nods sadly, last kiss
>
> Cas is brought to Naomi (enough hint for brainwash)

<br>

### (Chap 13) XIII. After the Time

> (Four Thousand Years later)
>
> 401 timeline (2009.9.18), they meet again in Hell/Pit, both feel familiar, neither remember, but somehow intuitively trust each other already (Cas: "haven't walked earth for two thousand years, haven't met a man like you for four thousand years")
>
> 603 run into Bal and salt pillar weapon again, Bal looks them from one to the other, meaningful eyes, Dean spits: "You got anything to say?" Bal: "Just remembering some good old time, that's all. Not like either of you are there or anything." Bal smiles, disappears. Dean/Cas exchange look, Cas tilts head, both feel like they forgot something. Dean look at Cas: "Doesn't matter. We're here now."

#### draft notes

Cas gets brainwashed by Naomi, so memory of this encounter is hidden (but not completely wiped), but Bal remembers

402 Cas: "Three days ago, you thought there was no such thing as me. Why do you think we're here walking among you now for the first time in 2,000 years?"

410 Anna: "I was stationed on earth 2,000 years. Just... watching... silent... invisible... out on the road... sick for home... waiting on orders from an unknowable father I can't begin to understand."

Abraham timeline is 2000 BC, so the Sodom time is 4000 years ago
