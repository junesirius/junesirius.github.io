### Original Sodom story from Bible

(English Standard Version)

#### Genesis 13

##### Abram and Lot Separate

So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.

Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the Lord. And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.

Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.” And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other. Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord.

#### Genesis 13

Bera: King of Sodom, Birsha: King of Gomorrah, Shinab: King of Admah, Shemeber: King of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar)

#### Genesis 18

Then the Lord said, “Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave, I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know.”

##### Abraham Intercedes for Sodom

So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the Lord. Then Abraham drew near and said, “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?” And the Lord said, “If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”

Abraham answered and said, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes. Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?” And he said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.” Again he spoke to him and said, “Suppose forty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of forty I will not do it.” Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there.” He answered, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.” He said, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.” Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.” And the Lord went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

#### Genesis 19

##### God Rescues Lot

The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth and said, “My lords, please turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way.” They said, “No; we will spend the night in the town square.” But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house. And they called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.” Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him, and said, “I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.” But they said, “Stand back!” And they said, “This fellow came to sojourn, and he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them.” Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down. But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door. And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.

Then the men said to Lot, “Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place. For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy it.” So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, “Up! Get out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city.” But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.

As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city.” But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the Lord being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city. And as they brought them out, one said, “Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away.” And Lot said to them, “Oh, no, my lords. Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die. Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there—is it not a little one?—and my life will be saved!” He said to him, “Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

##### God Destroys Sodom

The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven. And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.

And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord. And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.

So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.

##### Lot and His Daughters

Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters. And the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.” So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.

The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.” So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.

### Outline (1st version)

在索多玛蛾摩拉受折磨的天使（R级）

(inspired by 《[Clipped and Unbound](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1567589)》slaved angel world + ND_Tardis的《[罪恶之城](https://archiveofourown.org/works/19430962)》)

It's a city of blasphemy. When angels arrive, the humans here have ways to enslave and torture them. Cas comes with order to see if they are indeed as sinned as outcried and if so, punish them, end up being enslaved, torn and violated, locked down, distained. Dean is Lot in this story, the only moral righteous man, citizen of Sodom and Gomorrah, despise what his neighbors do to the angels, still have awe and faith for angels. Found Cas locked in his neighbor/father's cellar, quietly secretly try to help him, release him and help him heal himself. Cas has PTSD now and guarded against all humans, (almost/already?) hurt Dean (by accident), Dean doesn't complain, Cas feel guilty. Dean's father comes back find out, more pissed at Cas, torture/punish him more (Cas thinks he deserve this one, doesn't protest like he usually would), Dean heartbroken, thinking Cas is hurt more because of him, self-blame. John almost/want to kill Cas, Dean plead not to, has to make argument saying he should be the one to handle Cas since he's hurt by the angel, John agrees, leave him be. Cas actually thinks Dean is going to punish/torture/hurt/kill him, still doesn't protest and thinks he deserve it.

Dean open his lock/chain, Cas doesn't try to flee. Dean: "You are not going to leave?" Cas: "Where to?" He's already distained by human, he's dirty now, Heaven loathe any form related to human e.g. Nephilim, he doubts if heaven would still want him in

Dean sad, Cas not understand, Dean apologize, Cas apologize back, they kiss, two wounded creature by the city of sins

God punish the city, going to destroy it, Cas hear it from angel radio, propose to take Dean away, leave the city, never look back again, Dean plead to bring Sam too, Cas agree, Dean can't find heart to ask Cas to take John too so he doesn't ask even if he know he will hate himself for it

The city is destroyed, Sam (too young to understand everything) worry about John, look back, turn into pillar of salt, Dean cry in agony, Cas self-blame he can't save Sam too, Dean doesn't blame him

Bal find Dean/Cas, has the heaven weapon in hand, empathy on Cas, mojo him clean, bring him to heaven, Cas offer Dean come to Heaven too, Dean choose live/travel alone then reincarnation (become Dean of canon verse), Cas gets "cleaned up" by Naomi (thus brainwashed, no memory, Bal remembers?)

then the two meet again in 401, feel familiar, neither remember, but somehow intuitively trust each other already; 603 run into the salt weapon again, Bal gives him a meaningful eye

### (Chap 10) X. The Last Righteous Man

> Dean desperate, first time pray to God and other angels, thinks Cas doesn't deserve that. Bal answers, says Upstairs (God isn't there, it's Michael in charge) already decides to destroy city (Cas doesn't report back is proof enough), just wait for Dean to leave the city (Michael promised Abraham to save righteous men in the city, actually bc Dean's his vessel)
>
> Dean insists Bal to resurrect Cas, Bal makes it a deal: he can save Cas but Dean has to leave city (Sodom dies) or Dean stays and Cas dies (Sodom lives). Either way, Dean lives. Bal: "You said Sodom is worth saving, but everything comes with a price. Are those corrupted people out there who did this to him, worth his life? Are you going to exchange his life, for those ingratitude sinners?"
>
> Dean torn apart, cries hard, painful decision, refuse to choose either, too painful, start cursing angels/Heaven/God again, lost faith in angel/Heaven here, start getting angry and vicious, act as not care about saving the world again, counter proposal of killing himself and same both but not an option, eventually choose Cas

>
> Cas/Dean hug/kiss, Dean cries again, Cas looks at him sad. Dean asks what Bal said, Cas says Bal went off preparing for the weapon to destroy the city like they planned, but by choosing Cas and condemn the city, Dean isn't righteous man anymore, they're allowed to destroy the city with him in it. Dean: "He did say 'Everything comes with a price'", thinks it means he'd have to die, he doesn't regret choose to save Cas
>
> fire and sulphur start dropping into city, Cas makes his decision, disobeys order, offers to fly Dean/Sam out of city. Dean doesn't think he deserves anymore, Cas: "You always deserve saving." Sam pleads to bring John too, Cas thins lips, Dean doesn't know if he'd be happy about it, Cas warns them not to look back and flies them to Zoar

### (Chap 12) XII. Save the Righteous Man

> they can feel the fire heat from the burning cities (more than just Sodom, Gomorrah too, and Admah, Zeboiim), have to force themselves to not turn back to watch, Cas use wing to protect Sam/Dean's eyes. Cas stands there with them. John wakes up, turns to watch, becomes pillar of salt. Dean stares, unsure of how he feels. Sam just stares, Cas watches Dean in silence, as if wait for his orders
>
> Bal comes back with the salt weapon in hand. Cas: "You don't have to do that" Bal: "Order from Upstairs. (to Dean) You feel better?" (Michael's friendly gesture trying to earn Dean's faith back) Dean: "Not really. What now?" what's him and Sam gonna do alone in this world, with everyone they know destroyed
>
> Cas/Bal change look, Sam to Cas: "What you told us, that's not what all he told you, isn't it?" Bal to Cas: "Of course not, or it won't be secret. Unless you're ready." Dean: "Ready for what?" Cas to Dean: "You saved my life, so now we share a profound bond, I'll be watching over you for all my existence."
>
> Cas needs to go back to Heaven, Bal says Naomi requests to see him. Cas offers Dean come to Heaven too, Dean chooses to stay behind continue living/traveling in the world, wait to go to Heaven after he's done.
>
> Bal: "That's not an option either" he's not gonna go to Heaven after dead, he'll go into next reincarnation, bc Michael thinks he's not ready yet, it's like a training process. the decision he made shows he's not ready yet. Dean: "Then when is ready?" Bal: "In a few thousand years, we have some big plans. Spoilers. But it's a long time, don't have to worry now, go enjoy your boring monkey life, you have a few thousand years to kill."
>
> Dean to Cas: "Will I ever see you again?" Cas: "You will, I promise." Dean: "But I wouldn't remember you, would I? Everything we went through here, everything I did. I'll forget." Cas (small sad smile): "No, but it's okay." Dean nods sadly, last kiss
>
> Cas is brought to Naomi (enough hint for brainwash)

### (Chap 13) XIII. After the Time

> (Four Thousand Years later)
>
> 401 timeline (2009.9.18), they meet again in Hell/Pit, both feel familiar, neither remember, but somehow intuitively trust each other already (Cas: "haven't walked earth for two thousand years, haven't met a man like you for four thousand years")
>
> 603 run into Bal and salt pillar weapon again, Bal looks them from one to the other, meaningful eyes, Dean spits: "You got anything to say?" Bal: "Just remembering some good old time, that's all. Not like either of you are there or anything." Bal smiles, disappears. Dean/Cas exchange look, Cas tilts head, both feel like they forgot something. Dean look at Cas: "Doesn't matter. We're here now."

#### draft notes

Cas gets brainwashed by Naomi, so memory of this encounter is hidden (but not completely wiped), but Bal remembers

402 Cas: "Three days ago, you thought there was no such thing as me. Why do you think we're here walking among you now for the first time in 2,000 years?"

410 Anna: "I was stationed on earth 2,000 years. Just... watching... silent... invisible... out on the road... sick for home... waiting on orders from an unknowable father I can't begin to understand."

Abraham timeline is 2000 BC, so the Sodom time is 4000 years ago
