### Original Sodom story from Bible

(English Standard Version)

#### Genesis 13

##### Abram and Lot Separate

So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.

Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the Lord. And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.

Then Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left." And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other. Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord.

#### Genesis 13

Bera: King of Sodom, Birsha: King of Gomorrah, Shinab: King of Admah, Shemeber: King of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar)

#### Genesis 18

Then the Lord said, “Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave, I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know.”

##### Abraham Intercedes for Sodom

So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the Lord. Then Abraham drew near and said, "Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?" And the Lord said, "If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake."

Abraham answered and said, "Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes. Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?" And he said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there." Again he spoke to him and said, "Suppose forty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of forty I will not do it." Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there." He answered, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there." He said, "Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it." Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there." He answered, "For the sake of ten I will not destroy it." And the Lord went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

#### Genesis 19

##### God Rescues Lot

The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth and said, "My lords, please turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way." They said, "No; we will spend the night in the town square." But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house. And they called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them." Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him, and said, "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof." But they said, "Stand back!" And they said, "This fellow came to sojourn, and he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them." Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down. But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door. And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.

Then the men said to Lot, "Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place. For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy it." So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, "Up! Get out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city." But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.

As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city." But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the Lord being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city. And as they brought them out, one said, "Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away." And Lot said to them, "Oh, no, my lords. Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die. Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there—is it not a little one?—and my life will be saved!" He said to him, "Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there." Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

##### God Destroys Sodom

The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven. And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.

And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord. And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.

So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.

##### Lot and His Daughters

Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters. And the firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father." So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.

The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father." So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.

### Outline (1st version)

在索多玛蛾摩拉受折磨的天使（R级）

(inspired by 《[Clipped and Unbound](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1567589)》slaved angel world + ND_Tardis的《[罪恶之城](https://archiveofourown.org/works/19430962)》)

It's a city of blasphemy. When angels arrive, the humans here have ways to enslave and torture them. Cas comes with order to see if they are indeed as sinned as outcried and if so, punish them, end up being enslaved, torn and violated, locked down, distained. Dean is Lot in this story, the only moral righteous man, citizen of Sodom and Gomorrah, despise what his neighbors do to the angels, still have awe and faith for angels. Found Cas locked in his neighbor/father's cellar, quietly secretly try to help him, release him and help him heal himself. Cas has PTSD now and guarded against all humans, (almost/already?) hurt Dean (by accident), Dean doesn't complain, Cas feel guilty. Dean's father comes back find out, more pissed at Cas, torture/punish him more (Cas thinks he deserve this one, doesn't protest like he usually would), Dean heartbroken, thinking Cas is hurt more because of him, self-blame. John almost/want to kill Cas, Dean plead not to, has to make argument saying he should be the one to handle Cas since he's hurt by the angel, John agrees, leave him be. Cas actually thinks Dean is going to punish/torture/hurt/kill him, still doesn't protest and thinks he deserve it.

Dean open his lock/chain, Cas doesn't try to flee. Dean: "You are not going to leave?" Cas: "Where to?" He's already distained by human, he's dirty now, Heaven loathe any form related to human e.g. Nephilim, he doubts if heaven would still want him in.

Dean sad, Cas not understand, Dean apologize, Cas apologize back, they kiss, two wounded creature by the city of sins

God punish the city, going to destroy it, Cas hear it from angel radio, propose to take Dean away, leave the city, never look back again, Dean plead to bring Sam too, Cas agree, Dean can't find heart to ask Cas to take John too so he doesn't ask even if he know he will hate himself for it

The city is destroyed, Sam (too young to understand everything) worry about John, look back, turn into pillar of salt, Dean cry in agony, Cas self-blame he can't save Sam too, Dean doesn't blame him

Bal find Dean/Cas, has the heaven weapon in hand, empathy on Cas, mojo him clean, bring him to heaven, Cas offer Dean come to Heaven too, Dean choose live/travel alone then reincarnation (become Dean of canon verse), Cas gets "cleaned up" by Naomi (thus brainwashed, no memory, Bal remembers?)

then the two meet again in 401, feel familiar, neither remember, but somehow intuitively trust each other already; 603 run into the salt weapon again, Bal gives him a meaningful eye

### Claim

#### Claim Summary

Inspired by Genesis XIX, story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Dean's family are citizens of Sodom, a city where the villagers abuse and violate Angels. Dean is the only righteous man in the city.

Cas arrives in the city and gets mistreated, Dean wants to save him. The process of saving Cas from torture is slow, the two of them start getting closer and getting together. Dean's given the choice of saving Cas or saving the city. He chooses Cas in the end, with all the agony of having to make this decision, which ultimately deems him not righteous anymore.

The city is destroyed, Dean and Cas are moved out of the city. But it turns out to be a trial for Dean, it's Michael's plan of testing whether Dean's righteous enough or not, which turns out he's not ready. Michael puts him into reincarnation and tests him and waits for him for another four thousand years until the modern canon time, while Cas is taken to Naomi (to be brainwashed and have his memory wiped). So neither remembers the experience when they meet again in S4E01, but they trust and choose each other immediately again.

#### Visual

Cas is locked up by chains in a basement, enslaved, his wings broken, cloth torn, skin burned, very pitiful awful looking, has angel-proof carvings on the handcuffs and ground, holy oil circle around, blood distained, beaten up, very clearly has been violently violated, eyes panicked. Dean holds him tight and kisses him gently.

or

At some distance, the cities are burning, all flames and smoke. On a small hill, Dean and Cas are hugging and kissing. Cas is healed, his wings healthy and beautiful and spread out. Balthazar and Sam are around them, John is turned into a salt pillar facing the burning cities (not necessarily need to be depicted, just a note).

### Posting

#### Posting Summary

It is a land of sin and blasphemy. It is the city where Dean was born and lives. The city named Sodom.

It is a time when men hold no belief. It is the day the angel comes to the Earth. The angel named Castiel.

It is fate. It is choice.

The angel does not know what he is stepping into. The man does. And he tries so, so hard, to save him. Before they become the last righteous man and the last angel in the city that is sinned.

### Editing notes

#### Words before the work:

**Disclaimer:** The writer has no disrespect and, honestly, very limited knowledge of the biblical stories. This story is partially inspired by the biblical story, but mostly just an articulated fanfic story. Apologize in advance if there is any offense to religious readers, and please feel free to close the page if it makes you discomfort. Fair warning: It's a dark story.

Before you read anything, just know that I feel so, so sorry for writing this uncomfortable thing. It's heavy, it's heartbroken, it's painful, and I don't know why I put all my beloved characters through this (Maybe for the sweet little Comfort part of the Hurt/Comfort). Know that I cried when I was writing because I could quite literally, physically feel the pain I put them through. I confess and plead for forgiveness, from characters and readers alike. It's painful and troubling, among everything else. Please, <u>**please make sure to read the tags and warnings before you move forward.**</u> It's disturbing, even to me. But it will get better.

And now, if you're sure to proceed, enjoy the darkness.

#### Act 1

Dean shuts the door, but leaves it unlocked. He lowers the shades, too. The room falls into grey dimness. He lights the candles, placing them in the center of the dining table, shadowing the room with wavering light. There is baked unleavened bread on the desk, ready to serve.

It's not really night yet, outside. The sun is setting; the street in the dusk is still busy with the men of the city, young and old. He knows every one of them -- Sodom isn't a big city, everyone knows everyone here. So whenever there is someone from outside comes to the city, all of them know.

The men of the city are heading to the town square -- almost all of them, if they are not otherwise occupied. The sound from the street and outside is muffled, with the door and windows closed. But the sound from the square still sneaks in through the cracks -- loud, cheerful voices of men, and an unintelligible, squeaky, high-pitched scream.

Dean busies himself with cleaning the room, turning his back against the window.

The voices quiet down eventually. The uproar in the square recedes slowly.

"What's happening out there?" his young brother asks, lifting himself up from the bed, breathing heavily from the effort. He has been resting for the whole day until now, but he still looks pale and tired, coughing now and then. His young body is lean, his footsteps shaky on his way to sitting by the table.

Dean's not sure if it's the noise outside that woke Sam up or the lack of it. He rushes to give him a hand, supporting his weight.

"A newcomer arrived at the city earlier," he says simply, focusing on ensuring Sam sits steadily on the chair, pulling the basket of bread closer for him to reach.

"A merchant?" Sam takes a piece of bread, tearing it from one end, chewing slowly. He grimaces when he swallows, and then carefully proceeds with the next bite.

"An angel," Dean tells him.

"A real angel?" Sam looks up at him.

Dean shrugs slightly. "Don't think anyone would be interested in faking one," he says. "Not the first one in the city, probably not the last one either."

"Why aren't you out there then?" Sam asks, genuinely curious, if not a little confused.

"Why would I?" Dean asks plainly, edging away from their dining table, fidgeting in the kitchen to fill the wine and water bottle, facing away from the door and Sam.

Sam turns in the seat slightly to glance at the back of his brother. "Well, I believe everyone else is, and I bet Dad too."

"You don't know what they're doing to them out there." Dean says glumly, "And I hope you never would."

Sam opens his mouth, just in time for the door to open and their father walks in. His removed jacket hangs on his arms. He leaves it on the rack by the door, heading straight to the kitchen to rinse his hands, passing by Dean. Dean pretends he doesn't see the blood on his knuckles and broken feathers falling between his fingers.

"You look well today," John finishes up, wiping his hand on a kitchen rag, moving to sit down at the table, checking Sam up.

"I feel better too," Sam nods, then asks, "How's the angel, Dad?"

"So you heard." John flashes a glance at Dean once quickly. "They are peculiar creatures. We did what we enjoy, and now we know him in every sense."

The word *"know"* has many meanings, and Dean knows well enough that it's the worst kind in this sentence.

"Which is blasphemous and immoral." Dean can't help himself  from snapping, bringing the wine and water bottle over, putting them down on the table with a little too much force. "It's not right."

"I see your brother is still the same, innocent and difficult," John says sourly, still facing Sam. "Morality has nothing to do here, or piety. They're just some creature with wings, nothing so special. How many times do I need to remind you: when in Sodom, do as Sodoms do. It's nothing wrong when everyone's doing the same."

"It still is," Dean sits down at the table, bitter. "Why can't we move out of this city? I don't want to live like this, be like them." *I don't want to be like you.* He doesn't say.

John shrugs nonchalantly, undisturbed, just continues chewing and eating the bread. He answers after washing it down with a sup of wine. "Sam's not well for travelling, you know it. And where do you suggest we go? Gomorrah? Why would we even go farther east when we have a good life here? You should feel lucky to have a place to live in this city, boy."

Dean swallows, lowering his head, defeated. He glances in the direction of the door, thinking of the high-pitched sound he heard. The bread in his throat forms a lump, dry and cold. "Where is that angel now?"

John squints at him, eyes piercing through his skull, as if reading his mind. "Gone, dead, somewhere. I don't know. I don't care," he says casually. "And don't you even think about going out there to get yourself into stupid troubles, like disturbing people with nonsense like they shouldn't have fun as they please."

"That's not nonsense!" Dean protests futilely, sensing the burning gaze on his skull without having to look up.

"Having some wings and coming from the sky doesn't make them holy. We make them whores and playtoys and punchbags, and that's exactly what they are!" John snaps, throwing the bread back into the basket. "Those flying creatures are nothing more than entertainment to us. They are no stronger than us, no more powerful than us. We put them in chains and cuffs, and they can't move; we draw a circle with sigils, and they can't run; we beat them, and they bruise; we cut them, and they bleed. So tell me, why should we fear them or worship them?"

Dean wonders distantly who's the first sicko to discover the sigils that work on the angels, and all those carved brass knuckles, cuffs, blades, and the oil from Jerusalem (It's a short trip after all, Jerusalem is only a day or two's distance away to the west, even faster with camels).

"It's just not right. Why can't anyone see it?" Dean's voice drops, tired. He's tearing the bread between his fingers into small pieces with too much force, without eating it.

John points a finger at him, so close it almost pokes into his head. "Why can't *you* just be normal, like everyone else? You stop those stupid fancy little ideas of angels, or next time I make you come to the town square with me. Maybe you will understand once you try it. You hear me? Do you want that?"

Dean forces the lump in his throat down in a hard swallow. He can feel Sam's eyes on him, too.

The air in the room waits in uncomfortable silence.

"No, Sir. I hear you. I'll stop." Dean forces himself to answer, voice quiet.

"Good." John picks the bread again and resumes eating.

The dinner continues under the feint of quiet peace. The candle lights sway as they burn lower, the shadow in the room darker as time goes by.

Sam clears his throat. "Is there any other news out there, Dad?"

"Leah gave birth to a boy. Many are invited to witness." John answers absentmindedly.

"Not her husband's, I presume?" Sam asks, voice natural, just slightly curious. As if it's the most common thing to witness around here.

"Martin's," John says simply.

"Our rich neighbor Martin?" Sam chuckles, "He must have, what, like four kids with four different women now?"

John gives him a look, "Like most men in the city, yes. He has desires, so does everyone. There is no point in restraining what a man enjoys doing."

Dean leaves the table for the dishes, letting the running water help tune out the rest of their conversation.

<br>

#### Act 2

Dean lies in the dark, staring at the ceiling of his room. He doesn't check the time, but the moon must be high now. The shades keep the room dark.

His father snores lightly in the next room. His brother breathes evenly, easier than when he's awake.

There are faint sounds of frogs croaking in the distance, probably somewhere near the farmland.

Dean listens to the symphony of the night with opened eyes, wide awake. It's actually quiet and calm -- peaceful, even. But his mind keeps slipping to that high-pitched sound, for some reason, it seems to have stuck in his mind. *That must be the true voice of an angel,* he thinks. There was an angel in the city today, and then there wasn't, if his father was telling the truth.

Dean sits up in his bed quietly. But his father might not be telling the truth.

He sneaks out of the door without a sound, closing it carefully behind him.

The street is empty, the night air a little chilling but not cold. The moon is bright and round, hanging right over his head, shining the road silvery. He follows the road leading to the city square.

There is no angel there -- or any sign of one.

Whatever he's been expecting to see, whatever he's been bracing himself to prepare for, there is nothing to find. No sign of destruction, no sign of divinity, no sign of what the men of the city must have done to the angel. There is no sign of an angel at all.

He lingers around the square aimlessly, then starts wandering along the street. There is no high-pitched angel sound anywhere, even if he walks close to the houses, tilting his head to listen carefully inside. The angel has disappeared, as if it had never arrived.

He pauses at the door of his house for a moment, hesitating. From where he stands, Dean can see their neighbor Martin's house, bigger and taller than theirs, having two floors rather than one, the kind that can host a fancy guest room and a luxurious, well-equipped underground cellar. He can practically smell the corruption and hedonism from this distance. He wrinkles his nose.

He does not go into his own house.

His feet take him away, leading him to the gate of the city. He can't leave the city because his family is here, but he can stand at the gate, looking outside. As if the air here is cleaner than inside.

He sits by the gate of the city until the dawn breaks, letting his mind float away in a trance.

Dean blinks slowly as the night sky gradually shifts to a brighter color, the dark blue dyed over by golden clouds from the east. The sun rises over the horizon.

There is another source of light approaching slowly from the west. Lightning cracks the distant sky, accompanied by a tumbling roar of thunder. From the light brighter than the rising sun, a figure emerges on the land of wilderness, moving toward the city from afar.

The land outside the gate is flat with desert, muffling the image of the man with slowly flying sand. But the light radiating from his figure pierces through the dust, as steady as the north star.

Dean squints at the coming figure, wondering who that might be. He stands up from the ground, smoothing his cloth, waiting for the newcomer.

The man walks faster than Dean expects, or maybe he isn't walking, not really. He is also no ordinary man, for when he enters the clear view, Dean can see a pair of giant black wings spreading behind his back. Black as midnight, spreading wide into the sky when he travels through the land. He folds it closer when he approaches the city.

Dean can't help but stare. It's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. The light, the wings, the man.

"You're an angel." He hears himself saying, through his dry lips. His brain goes blank, knowing nothing else to do but stare at the newcomer.

The angel wears a long black tunic, with a tan linen robe on the outside, much like the men in the city. Dean wouldn't know he isn't local just from the dressing. But somehow, these clothes seem quite fitting on him, could easily blend in the city, but also don't make him any less celestial. His face is devastatingly handsome, with eyes so heavenly blue. Dazzling blue light lingers in his eyes for a moment longer, before it dims into pupils that look as beautiful as the purest sapphire.

A belt tightens on his waist, displaying quietly a trim, well-built figure underneath. Dean stops his train of thought and drags his eyes back up to his face.

"I am Castiel, Angel of the Lord." The angel announces with a low voice, looking at Dean bluntly without blinking.

"I'm Dean, Son of John, Brother of Sam," Dean tells him nervously, running directly into that pair of intense eyes, feeling his skin start crawling, but he holds the gaze.

"Are you a citizen of Sodom?" Castiel asks.

"Yes, born and raised, for two decades." Dean nods uneasily, almost ashamed of admitting his connection to this city. He swallows, troubled by the querying look in the angel's eyes. His fingers fidget around the skirt of his own tunic, his eyes shift between Castiel's eyes, lips, and the wings behind him.

"Then you may lead the way, for I bear the order of inspecting the city." Castiel looks over his shoulder, at the city behind the gate.

The sun has risen, and the city is waking to a bright morning. The men of the city walk onto the street, the cheerful mundane chatters buzzing in the air.

Dean half turns, following his gaze, seeing what he's looking at. "Are you not here rescuing the angel visited yesterday?" He blurts out.

Castiel pulls his gaze back onto Dean's face with more focus. "Rescue? Why would an angel require rescue from a city of mankind?" His face is stern with concentration, the eyebrows slightly knitting together.

"You don't know men of Sodom, I do. They're... unfriendly, to the outsiders, especially angels." Dean lowers his voice, glancing nervously behind him, slowing down whenever someone is standing too close to the gate where they might be overheard. His heart pounds rapidly inside his chest. "They are ruthless, and dangerous. I don't know what happened to the angel coming yesterday, but I heard him screaming. I fear the worst has happened."

Dean swallows hard, searching Castiel's face, looking for a sign of hesitation, but fails to find one. "Please don't go into the city. If you have to, you can stay at my house. You will be safe as long as my father is not there. My brother is not like them."

"No." Castiel looks at him straight, and says plainly, "Your offer is appreciated, yet that shall not be necessary. I will go to the square, and announce my arrival to the people of the city. My safety will not be of concern, for I am a warrior in my garrison, and I have fought evil from Hell. No mankind would be equivalent." He lifts his chin with pride.

"All the angels coming before today must have thought the same, did Heaven not notice that none of them returned?" Dean urges, frowning deeply, worried. "You've never been to Sodom. Those people are strong; they have powerful weapons and tools. I don't want to see any more angels get hurt --"

Castiel waves him off. "I have decided. Now I shall go to the square to fulfill my order."

"Then at least allow me to be with you during your stay," Dean says quickly. "I'm familiar with the city. I can be your guide."

Castiel nods. "So shall it be."

<br>

They are noticed by people the moment they walk past the gate. In fact, Dean suspects they might have already caught attention when they were having that vain argument of a discussion that he failed to change the angel's mind.

Now that they walk onto the street, with Dean leading half a step ahead and the angel having his wings tucked behind his back, Dean has never been so conscious of his own existence. People stop what they were doing to turn and look at them. Their eyes land meaningfully on them, lingering between him and Castiel. He doesn't need to meet any of their eyes to know the way they're looking -- the gleeful looks of predators, invasive, avid, like a group of hyenas, as if they can peel his skin off with those eyes. Dean picks up the pace, as if escaping.

More people drop what they were busy with, and start following them from a short distance away, forming a tailing crowd fast.

"Dean!" One of them calls to him, "Where do you find an angel all to yourself? Is this why you didn't come join us yesterday? Having too much fun with this one?"

Another shouts, "Where are you going? Don't keep him to yourself. Introduce him to us so we may know him!"

A loud laughter and yelling of agreement burst from the crowd.

Dean glares behind his shoulder, furious with embarrassment. *How can they talk about angels like this? How can they talk as if he and this Angel of the Lord are... something intimate? Something physical and primal?*

He shakes his head in disbelief. *How can they even think about staining them that way? Didn't they see how beautiful and bright the angels are? Or is that just in his eyes?*

The crowd only laughs louder at his glower.

Dean decidedly ignores them, urging Castiel under his breath to speed up. The angel merely observes them with thinned lips and disapproving frowns, not saying a thing.

They almost pass through his house when Dean spots his father standing at the door, holding his arms. The look in his eyes is outrageous, burning with fury. Dean's blood freezes to ice.

He hears John's voice before he reaches the doorsteps.

"Where have you been?!" John growls at him, "Your brother could be dying when you're doing whatever, sneaking out in the middle of the night like that!"

Dean stops automatically with a gasp. "Sam's dying? He seemed fine and improved last night."

"He would if you didn't get your lazy ass over here and prepare his meds! We're running out of herbs, so go get those for him." John orders.

Dean frowns. "It can't be. There's plenty left from yesterday."

Then he notices the burning roll of a cigar between his father's fingers. *Oh.*

John scowls. "Are you defying me, boy? It's gone now. So go get more!"

Dean blinks, looking between John and Castiel, then turning back to his father. "The herbs are in the mountains. It will take me at least three days to go there and back." His voice deeply troubled.

"Then why aren't you leaving already?" John glares at him. "Surely you don't have anything more important to do?" His eyes flicker to the angel.

The crowds following them have already caught up, surrounding them with interested eyes, witnessing the matter. One of them shouts joyfully, waving with something shiny and reflective in their hands, "Don't worry about the angel! We'll take care of him!"

The rest of them laugh. Another adds loudly, "We'll make sure to leave you a piece!" Followed by a clanking metal sound.

Dean winces at the sound and the words, glancing back at the angel.

"Castiel --" he starts, voice low and eager. "I can't --"

"Go," the angel answers him resolutely. "I see you have other responsibilities. I shall carry on my task alone."

"Follow the street to the end and turn to the biggest road," Dean looks at him, biting his lower lip, then turns to point at the end of the road with his fingers, "that will take you to the center of the city, the square."

Castiel nods briefly with appreciation.

"Please be careful, Castiel." Dean lowers his voice so those other people, including his father, would not hear them; his voice rushed with worry, bordering on pleading. "Leave the city as soon as you can, please. I will come back in three days."

"Farewell, Dean," the angel says formally.

They part ways.

Castiel walks down the street, and Dean takes the opposite way, heading out of the city toward the mountains.

When he looks back at the end of the street, he loses sight of Castiel already -- the crowd following the angel is like a moving wall, covering all the views, not leaving a single glimpse of his wings. Like an ominous sign.

Dean thinks -- he wishes Castiel safe. And deep down, not knowing why, he wishes he would see the angel again.

He's already missing that light as bright as the rising sun.

#### draft notes

people of Sodom is strong, powerful enough to confine angels, has angel-proofing weapons/handcuffs and holy oil

Dean is the only moral righteous man, young, citizen of Sodom, despise what his neighbors do to the angels, still have awe and faith for angels.

Cas comes with order to see if they are indeed as sinned as the outcries and if so punish them (and to find the other missing angel Amos, member of his garrison) (Why Cas doesn't leave as soon as he sees how ill-mannered they are -- Cas secretly actually also hope he can find the proof that the city is still worth saving. He wants to find more kind/good/righteous men like Dean. Just one more man like Dean, so he lingers longer than necessary, only to be captured and proved wrong.)

~~they don't get to choose where to be born~~

Dean is forced to do nothing about the missing/hurt angel the previous day, even if he protested/tried to find him, he hates it for himself

Dean can hear angel true voice, already a surprise to Cas/most angels/men

Dean start unknowingly praying and Cas start able to hear him through prayer

the way Cas speaks, start off very formal, biblical style, slowly turning to normal verbal Dean style sentences

(Sam 17y, Dean 21y)

### (Chap 2) II. Where is the Angel

> Dean comes back out after three days (Sam doesn't get better but stabled, he goes to get meds), goes to the city square, Cas is gone, Dean only finds broken feathers and blood and lingering grace, people laughing talking about new angel, Dean heart hurt, find a vial to collect Cas's lost grace
>
> Dean starts looking for the angel, hoping it's not too late, doesn't dare asking around for fear they know they're close, notice signs of Cas's appearance and grace and cloth pieces here and there, torn trench coats etc., imagining the worst already

Dean comes back around noon on the third day, with a bruised body and a dislocated shoulder.

It would have taken him another half-day if he had taken the usual route, but a thread of thought kept tightening and pulling at the back of his head. He can't wave off the irreverent, erotic looks on the people's faces when they look and talk about the angels. They make him scared.

The shortest path in the mountain isn't a road, and falling all the way down could have killed him if he hadn't happened to be caught by the bushes. Disturbed sand flies into his eyes and nose. He lies on the ground on his back, coughing to clear his lungs of the sand.

Sun glares into his eyes from on top of his head. Dean wonders if all the angels are bright like that, or it's just Castiel's. He wonders if the angel was clever enough to leave the city already.

He struggles to roll on the ground and haul himself up, and keeps heading back to the city. His footsteps are unsteady from exhaustion and pain, but he wills them to move as fast as he can.

The city looks the same as when he left. Town folks walk along the street, talking loudly -- but not about angels. Dean tries to pick a word or two when he passes them by, just to prepare himself, to know what might have happened, but he doesn't get much luck.

Dean drops the newly collected herbs at home. John isn't at home, and Sam is sleeping. He decides he can make some meds for Sam later, so he rushes out again.

His footsteps stagger even more as he approaches the town square. For three days, his thoughts have been wandering around this place, and now, the closer he gets, the more scared he is.

*Please.*

Dean stares at the end of the main road, thinking.

*Please tell me you're okay. Please tell me I'm not gonna find you bloody or... anything worse.*

*Please tell me you just left.*

He closes his eyes once, takes a deep breath, and walks into the town square.

"No, no, no --" Dean gasps, dropping to his knees.

The angel is not here. But his clothes and broken feathers are.

The tan linen robe Dean saw him wear earlier is stained by blood, crumpled and laid out in the center of the square. The once-elegant black tunic was torn to rags, then deliberately placed so that it forms into the shape of a human figure. As if the angel once was lying in that exact location, being torn apart.

Long, black feathers that were undoubtedly once extending and stretching proudly on Castiel's wings, are now scattered on both sides of the clothes, replicating the look of the wings. A crude mock.

Dean can hear the lingering sound of the angel's scream just by looking at the scene.

He throws up right there, vomiting everything in his stomach. Tears cover his face.

"Like what we did there?" A cheerful voice sounds up next to him. The man kneels down to enjoy his face. "That's my idea, after we all finished having fun."

"What --" Dean looks up and sees the man's face. "Arthur."

The man was among the crowd, the last time he saw him.

"What have you done?"

"Just the usual, you know," Arthur grins lightly, almost like he's remembering a sweet memory. "We all take our turns and have our fun. Oh boy, he really is the best, you can't imagine how good it feels to fu --"

Dean's fist hits the man's face, throwing him back. The ceramic jar Arthur was holding crashes to the ground, breaking apart, showing thin, sluggish white-blue light swirling inside. The light starts flying upward the moment it leaves the jar.

"Oh Lord," Dean cries, reaching for the light with his bare hands. He knows immediately what that light is, even before Arthur starts talking again. The light lingers between his fingers when he touches it, reluctant to leave, but also seems too light to stay. It's falling apart, thinning into the air.

"No, no, no." Dean fumbles in his pocket to find his water flask, pouring all the liquid onto the ground, aiming its opening to the light.

"Please," he murmurs, leading the light with his fingers.

It moves slowly, but obediently. Dean makes sure every last bit of the light is filled into the flask before closing it, holding it to his chest against his heart like a dear treasure. "Lord has mercy," he whispers, not caring about all the tears smearing his face.

Arthur watches him with a satisfying avenging smile, standing up from the ground, pressing the side of the face that's swollen from the punch. "What's the problem with you?! Told you we'd leave you a piece."

Dean is still kneeling on the ground, eyes shut in pain, holding to the flask. "Where is he?" His voice is broken.

Arthur makes an impatient sound between his teeth. "You know, I was going to tell you. But now that you punched me, I don't think so. Enjoy the angel grace." He walks away coldly.

"No!" Dean bursts out in a yell. His chest is so tight and pained that he thinks his heart is going to explode. But he doesn't die.

The small crowd of people who were gathering to watch their quarrel also split now, leaving him alone in the square.

Dean drags himself closer to the clothes that belonged to Castiel.

"I thought I could save at least one angel," he whispers to the robe and tunic and broken feathers. "I'm sorry I didn't insist on staying with you. I'm sorry I failed you. I'm sorry."

He picks up all the scattered black feathers, collecting them inside the clothes, wrapping them into a small bundle, holding them like a cradle.

That's when he replays Arthur's words in his head and realizes, "He said he's gonna tell me where you are, which means you must be still alive. Castiel, I'll find you. And I'll save you. I promise."

### (Chap 3) III. Raggedy Doll

> after three more days, Dean finds Cas in his neighbor's cellar, enslaved, wings broken, cloth torn, very pitiful looking, skin burned, locked up, has angel-proof carvings and holy oil everywhere, chest carved with humiliation, blood distained, beaten up, very obviously sexually violated, currently passed out. maybe witness Cas violated again by some random guy
>
> Dean takes pity, sneaks in, quietly secretly try to release him, wants to steal him out, want to help him free, hope he can still heal himself
>
> Cas has PTSD now, guarded against all humans, very easily irritated, attacking dog mode. Dean isn't ready for the attack (or is ready but still doesn't dodge quick enough, Cas is still fairly strong)
>
> Cas hurt Dean accidentally. Dean doesn't complain, doesn't want to be found, set Cas free, but they're still found by the neighbor

Dean searches the city.

For three days, Dean searches every corner of the city that he can think of. But it's a big city. And there are so many corners he can't reach -- like people's houses. His search comes futile, his exhausted body even more tired.

More than once, a part of his brain wanders out, asking why he's even doing this. He should be going back home, taking care of his brother, serving his father, acting normal, having a life like the angel has never come. He doesn't even really know the angel, except for his name and that very brief talk on the first day. The angel might not even remember him. But then he remembers the first sight of the angel, that beautiful light radiating from him that looks like coming directly from Heaven. He remembers those blue eyes boring into his, as if seeing through his soul, seeing him in a way no one has ever done. He wonders what the angel sees in him; he wonders what the angel thinks of him, of the city; he wonders if it's the first time the angel has ever come to Earth; he wonders so many things and realizes he knows so little about the angel; he just wants to talk to him again. He knows he has to save him, even just to see those eyes again.

So he continues trying. Dean tries so, so hard, dragging himself from one house to another, looking for a sign of an angel, waiting for a miracle.

The hope is running thin, but he can't stop. Every time he closes his eyes, he sees the pile of clothes with blood in it, his brain paints a broken angel with torn wings in the middle, tortured and violated by the mob. He dreams about it, too, every time, if he lets himself fall asleep briefly. He dreams about the angel's scream.

On the fourth day after he came back from the mountains, Dean starts awake from another one of those dreams. He had to watch those men of the city tear open the angel's clothes, pinning him down, distaining him. Dean yelled and cried, desperately trying to reach out, to throw those people out, to cover the angel's body, to help him, to save him. But in his dream, he was just like a ghost; no one could hear him, no one he could touch. So he had to stand there in his dream, just watching it happen, watching the angel scream with rage and pain, watching him struggle but his hands were locked together by the cuffs, his legs getting roughly opened apart. Dean feels his heart bleeding worse than the wounds on the angel's body, squeezing so hard he can't breathe. That's when he starts awake, finding himself falling asleep on the dining room table. He's panting heavily, gulping for air.

Dean steps out of the house, breathing deep, trying to calm his frantically beating heart.

The cool air of the deep night helps with the burning pain in his chest.

*It's just a dream. It's just a dream.* He tries to soothe his own restless mind. But even he knows it's too thin a hope, knowing what had happened to all the other angels before him.

He looks up at the night sky, staring at the blinking stars, tired and desperate. *Where are you, angel? How can I save you?*

That's when he notices someone moving at the front of his neighbor's house. Someone talking.

It's an odd hour to have visitors come and go.

Dean sneaks over to stay in the shadow between the houses.

Arthur walks out of Martin's place, tugging and smoothing his clothes. His belt is untied, hanging loosely around his waist. He leaves a handful of coins in Martin's palm, saying, "You're making it a damn good business, Martin. How much are you earning these days, with that little feathered whore chained down there?"

Martin chuckles slightly. "People are still lining up for him, can you believe that? But I get it, everyone loves a little fun, and he's the best one ever, am I right? But you know what's the best part for me? I get to use him whenever I want." He laughs shamelessly.

"Let me guess, you'll take him all for yourself for the whole night, once I'm gone?" Arthur is about outside the threshold onto the road now. Dean hides deeper into the shadow, teeth gritting so tight that they might break.

"Nah, think I had enough of him for a week, maybe I'll go to Leah's. Her husband is at Jane's tonight."

"Well, have a good night. I'll come by when I feel like it again. Which, you know, could just be tomorrow."

"Any time, as long as he's not occupied." Martin shakes his hand and moves back into his house.

"Or maybe we can make that work, too." Arthur finishes tying his belt, leaning a hand on the doorframe.

"True." Martin nods, then closes his door.

Dean waits until Arthur's contented whistle disappears at the turn of the block before moving out of the hiding place. He tastes blood on his lower lip from biting it too hard. His knuckles are still white from clenching too tight, his hands trembling in rage.

If he's not still believing in the Lord and His commandments, and if "You shall not kill" is not one of them, he really, really wants to kill every single one of them who has hurt the angel.

But at least, now he knows Castiel is still alive, and right in the cellar of Martin's house, he can't wait any longer for Martin to leave the place to go to him.

The light on the second floor is still on. But the first floor sounds quiet enough, and Dean finds a side window with a crack open. He pushes it open and climbs in. The stairs leading downward are right next to it.

Dean finds the right door easily -- it's the only room with a lock, hanging heavily on the handle.

The key must be with Martin.

"Dammit," Dean curses, fumbling it with bare hands, but the lock doesn't give way. He thinks he can hear a vague rustling sound from across the door. The sound scratches his heart hard, squeezing it like an invisible hand, making his breath fast and his fingers clumsy.

He moves back upstairs, searching for the keys.

Martin is asleep in his luxurious bedroom on the second floor, with a dim lamp standing near the window. Dean sneaks in and finds the keys on top of the dresser. He holds his breath and takes them. Martin doesn't stir when he leaves the room.

It takes him three tries to put the correct key into the lock and turn. When it finally opens, Dean feels the rush of relief is almost dizzying. But right next second, his breath is caught again, his blood dropping to freeze.

The room smells of blood and come.

He can barely tell the shape lying on the floor is an angel, more like a raggedy doll. Castiel lies bare on the floor in the middle of the chamber, his hands cuffed to the ceiling, rising unnaturally above his body. Around him, the floor is painted with a large sigil, decorated with pentagons and letters and symbols beyond Dean's knowledge. The angel's wings are unnaturally twisted from the joints, lying pitifully under his back, fallen feathers scattered everywhere.

His pale skin is covered in colors, dark bruises and fresh cuts mixed with old scabs, staining him with red and black and white. His legs spread tiredly apart, blood dripping along his thighs.

Dean gasps in horror when he takes it all in.

"Oh God," he steps into the chamber.

Castiel stirs at the sound, opening his eyes, following tiredly as Dean moves closer. His lips quiver, but no sound comes out.

Dean lowers his body, edging toward him slowly. "Hey," he breathes, his throat choked by a lump. "Castiel. It's me."

He looks the angel in the eyes, but there is no sign of recognition, of joy, or relief. Just the same wounded look, same tiredness and glassiness. He wonders if the angel forgets him in a week's time -- a week, God, it feels like forever.

He should clean him up; he should cover him with clothes; he should uncuff his hands; he should take him out of there. Dean struggles with what to do first.

He undresses his robe.

Castiel flinches violently, cowering back as far as the cuffs allow. His lips move again, and the first syllable tumbling out, broken and scared, is, "No."

Guarded alert and panic flash through his face, rage and heartbroken overtaking it a second later.

"No," he says, croaked and clipped.

Then again, "No."

Dean grasps the edge of his robe, stopping halfway of wanting to cover it over the angel, letting his tears gather quickly and fall from the corners of his eyes.

"I'm not hurting you, Castiel. I'm not one of them," he whispers, pained. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything."

The angel flinches again when he hears his name. Guarded look doesn't leave him -- Dean is not sure if he even understands his words.

He shuts his eyes once, squeezing the tears out, leaving his robe on the floor next to the angel.

"I'll... I'll just leave it here first, then," Dean whispers, standing up to reach for the cuffs, fumbling the chain of keys. Castiel struggles again, wringing his hand against the cuffs, trying to avoid him.

"Castiel -- Cas, please," Dean has to stop his move, looking into the angel's eyes, begging quietly. "I'm not hurting you, I'm getting you out of here. I'm Dean, remember?" He reaches out slowly, trying to close the distance between the keys in his hand and the lock on the cuffs.

He's answered by another round of violent shaking of his head and dodging and struggling.

The struggle makes the chains connected to the cuffs clink and clank. Dean throws a worried look in the door's direction, wondering if it's too loud to wake up Martin. The cellar door is still closed behind them.

"Please," he murmurs again, turning back to Castiel, finding the angel's eyes shift between him and the door.

Dean tries hard to pull up a small, hopefully soothing smile. "That's right, the door, out, free. I'm getting you out of here. I just need you to work with me. Cas, please."

The angel's eyes focus back onto his face. Dean feels the muscle on his face twitch in stress, his eyes want nothing more than to cry, his lips quiver in pain, but he forces the smile to stay there, praying silently, *Please, Cas, work with me here. I'm getting you out.*

Castiel's struggle quiets down.

Dean lets out a relieved sigh, unlocking his cuffs.

The angel takes his hands back in a flash, holding his wrists close to his chest. He turns them slowly, as if it hurts to move. Dark bruises and blood stains cover where the cuffs once were.

Dean's forced smile completely drops.

"I know I heard something, thought I got a thief." Martin bursts through the door. Dean turns sharply, finding him holding a long and sharp blade in his hand, glinting with a sharp silvery reflection, covered in red on the tip.

Dean takes a step back in reflection, tripping over his own robe on the floor. "I'm not --" He struggles with thoughts, can't come up with a good reason.

"Not a thief?" Martin takes a step forward, standing right on the edge outside the ring of sigils. "Then what are you doing here? Taking a free feast to have fun with him? He's mine now, you know. You have to pay."

Dean throws a fist onto Martin's face, knocking him down. The blade in the man's hand tumbles to the floor.

Dean clutches his collar, giving him a second punch. "He's an angel!" he yells, tears falling again out of control. "He's not anyone's! And he's certainly not yours!"

When he's about to land a third hit, he gets pushed aside. None of them notices when Castiel gets hold of the blade. He charges forward fiercely, bumping into Martin, swinging the blade at him to attack.

But Martin catches Castiel's wrist and twists it back right where the previous bruise and cut is, before the blade can reach his chest. The angel yells in pain and loses control of the blade, snatching back to get free from the grasp. The blade draws a curve as his arm waves back, swiping across Dean's flank, slicing a long, deep cut across his abdomen.

Dean gasps in pain, falling to the floor, covering the cut with both hands. Blood gushes out from between his fingers.

That seems to put all the motion in the room in a pause.

"Dean!" Castiel cries out, startled, turning to him.

"This is madness!" Martin grumbles, fumbles in his pocket. He casts a match and throws it at the edge of the sigil on the floor. A ring of fire encircles Dean and Castiel as they're distracted.

"What are you doing?! Let me out!" Dean snaps. Blood is still pouring out fast.

"I'm calling your father, young man." Martin retreats to the door, his face twitching. "What do you think he will do to this wild angel that kills you?"

It can be painful to read. Because it's very painful to write.

Proceed with discretion.

<br>

Dean starts to feel his limbs cold and numb, with all the blood he's losing. He decides to lie down on the floor for a bit.

The ground is cold and hard, and sticky. He wonders if that's how Castiel spends the whole week, day and night.

"Hey," he whispers, glancing aside to look for the angel, his voice barely louder than the sound of fire burning the oil. He feels his whole body tired, his vision blurry.

Castiel is kneeling beside him, looking helpless. The blade is dropped to the ground next to him. The flame reflects in his pupils, flickering brightly and wildly.

It reminds him of the first time they met. Dean thinks. That sun rise, the lightning cracking the sky open. That beautiful, brilliant light coming from the angel.

And now, look at them.

Both trapped and bloody.

Dean takes a breath, locking his eyes with the angel. Even breathing hurts, he wonders how deep the cut is. But he pushes that thought aside.

"It's okay," he tells the angel. "And I'm sorry. Looks like I can't help you out now." He pulls a sad smile.

Castiel looks at him so intensely. "I'm sorry, Dean," he says, voice rolling deep and miserable. "I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to..."

"I know, I know." Dean rushes eagerly. It makes the pain in the stomach even worse. He grimaces. "It's not your fault."

"What can I do for you?" the angel studies his face, asking. "To make you more comfortable?"

Dean huffs bitterly. There is nothing called "comfortable" right now. But he indulges him, telling him, "I'm cold."

Castiel reaches over him to drag the dropped robe over, covering it on Dean's body.

Dean huffs another small laugh. "It's supposed to be for you, you know. Thought you could use some cover." He makes a small nod toward Castiel's bare body.

Castiel shakes his head. "It is not of import," he says, tugging the robe higher to cover most of Dean's body. His fingers brush Dean's chin for a second. "Is it better?"

It doesn't make much difference, but it feels nice during that blink of touch. So Dean smiles at him weakly. "Yes."

The stickiness between his fingers feels thinner now, but the drowsiness is hitting him hard. Dean finds his eyelids growing heavier and heavier, closing slowly.

"Dean, don't die, please." Castiel puts his hand on Dean's shoulder, tone pleading.

It sounds like, *Don't leave me alone. Don't leave me with them again.* Dean thinks.

He complies, struggling to open up his eyes again, running into the angel's worried face.

The angel moves his hands to his wound, staring and frowning with focus, as if he's trying something really hard; he's trying to do something with his wound.

"What are you doing?" Dean asks.

"Healing you," Castiel answers with sad, sad eyes. "But it's not working. I think it's the sigils; it's blocking my grace. I can't even heal myself."

"I'm useless." He slumps back, sitting on his heels, looking defeated.

"Grace," Dean murmurs slowly, eyes widening, remembering. "The flask. In my pocket. It has some of your grace. Would it help you?"

Dean tries to move his fingers to reach for the robe's pocket, but Castiel moves faster, taking it out, holding it with two hands. He stares at its inside with fascination. Thin thread light of grace starts slowly flowing out of its opening once the cap is removed.

"Yes," Castiel looks at the light longingly. "Yes, it does. It can make me stronger."

"Take it," Dean tells him. "It's yours, anyway."

"But I don't know if it will make me strong enough to break the sigil." Castiel eyes the flask, then looks down at Dean's cut.

He leans over to put the flask against Dean's mouth instead.

"What's that for?!" Dean tries to keep his mouth shut before any of the light flies into him. He stares at the angel in confusion.

Castiel tilts the flask even more, letting the light fly out more easily. He answers quietly, "It might not be so useful for me, but it can definitely heal you. You should take it."

"Don't do this, Cas! You need it, you're hurt!" Dean protests. But even as he speaks, he can feel the bone-deep tiredness and drowsiness come back, his vision starts blurring, and his lips falling limp.

"You need it more," Castiel insists, feeding the grace into him.

Light flows smoothly from the flask into Dean's mouth, traveling through his veins. It starts off with a warm sensation, and soon it turns burning hot. Dean's eyes snap open, gasping in surprise. The heated grace moves through his vein, curing his wounded shoulder and bruised leg along the way, converging on the lower abdomen.

He peels off the robe and removes his hands. The white-blue light knits against his skin like magic needles and thread. The pain is released quickly, the muscle and skin feel itching, then grow strong and tight again. He wipes the blood away with his clothes. That long, nasty gash is already gone, his skin smooth and healthy, leaving no sign of a cut except for the tear on his cloth.

"Wow," Dean exclaims. "That's... that's a miracle." He looks up at Cas with awe in his eyes. "You really are an Angel."

Castiel finally shows a small curl on the tips of his lips. "I'm glad it worked."

Dean props himself up, thinking about reaching to give the angel a hug, telling him, it's not an *it* that saved him, it's *him*, when two sets of footsteps storm down the stairs.

"Where is my son? Where is the filthy thing? I'll kill it." John shouts, bursting through the door.

Dean startles, leaning away from the angel. "Dad!" he pulls himself together. "I'm fine! See, I'm okay!" He gets to his feet, trying to show his father where the wound was but now healed. "He saved me!"

But John ignores him, stepping across the fire circle, grasping the angel by the left wing, dragging him over from the kneeling position, then kicking him on the chest.

Castiel doesn't resist. John's shoe hits him hard and his body flies back, but his wing is still clenched in John's fist.

Dean hears a clear crack in his wing bone.

"Dad! Stop!" he cries out, throwing himself to the angel, covering him with his own body, carefully holding his shoulders.

John shoves him aside. "This thing could have killed you! What kind of father would I be if I just let it walk away free?"

He drags the angel closer again, choking his throat in one hand, hauling him toward the burning fire circle. The tip of his feathers catches fire first, curled and charred in an instant. The fire climbs to his skin next. Anywhere the flame touches, his skin burns and recoils, starting to leak the white-blue light like his body is nothing more than a thin layer of skin that contains the light. A high-pitched sound starts echoing in the claustrophobic space.

"Try the holy oil, you son of a bitch!" John growls at the angel.

Castiel's body lies limp in John's hand, and light starts gathering in his mouth and eyes. He struggles to lift his eyes to search for Dean.

"I'm sorry, Dean, for hurting you," he chokes, can't forming a complete sentence through the tightened hand on his throat. "I deserve this."

"Goodbye, Dean," he says, then closes his eyes and waits.

Dean picks up the blade that the angel dropped earlier, pointing it at John. His voice broken and devastated, "STOP THIS! NOW!"

John pulls the angel back from the fire slightly, eying the blade incredulously. "What are you going to do, Dean? Killing your father for this thing?"

Dean lets out a bitter laugh, reciting. "*Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.* You may have no faith and don't care about the Ten Commandments, but I still do." He shifts the blade, pointing it at Cas instead.

He swallows, then tells John, "No, I will not kill you, father. I was thinking about blood for blood. The angel almost killed me, then *I* should be the one to punish him, not you." He stares at John in the eyes, waiting.

John looks at him, eyes shifting between his steady gaze and his hands that hold the blade. Old blood coats its edge and hilt.

Time is stretched long and agonizingly slow.

Only the sound of the burning flame cracking around them.

It's as if everyone has stopped breathing. Waiting.

It's like the judgment day, and mankind is waiting for their judgment.

Dean's eyes burn with dryness from staring too long without blinking. He doesn't notice it.

John pulls Castiel back, throwing him back onto the floor before him. "Fine," he snaps. "Suit yourself. Kill him, then."

Dean's shoulders slump. He drops the blade, throws himself over to the angel, holding his shoulders, shaking slightly.

More burned feathers fall from his wings, piling on the ground. The angel's face is more pale than ever, blood streaming from the corner of his mouth, eyes glassy, breathing shallowly, barely but still alive.

Dean cradles his body in his arms, like holding a fragile thing.

John kicks the blade so it slides next to his hands. "What are you still waiting for? Go ahead, finish it."

Dean takes a deep breath, looking up. "It would be too easy for him to just die like this. I'm not done with torturing him yet. He should feel more pain, for everything he put me through."

He glances between John and Martin, focusing on his father, "We should take him home, so I can continue the punishment."

John and Martin exchange a look.

"No," Martin protests. "He's my property!"

John turns to him. "My boy has a point. It's blood debt; he should be the one to decide his fate. Besides, you don't *own* him. He came to the city; he's all of ours."

Martin scowls at him, shifting between John and Dean, eyes lingering on the bare angel. "Fine," he grits out at last.

John regards the enslaving set the cellar has. "Mind if we take the cuffs and those things, too? It could come in handy."

Martin glares at him harder, answering bitterly, "Sure." He stomps out.

Dean wraps Cas in his robe, and carries him home in his arms.

They don't have a cellar like those rich people's houses, nor a spare room.

"I'll just lock him in my room, then," Dean says, carrying Cas into his room before John can say anything.

He takes the cuffs and blade from his father, then locks the door.

#### draft notes

~~John comes back find out Dean's wounded by Cas, super pissed at Cas, hurt/torture him more, almost kill him.~~

~~Dean pleads for Cas, manages to take him home~~

Dean heartbroken, think Cas is hurt more bc of him, self-blame

### (Chap 5) V. The Sins

> Dean opens Cas's lock/chain, Cas doesn't try to escape. Dean: "You're not going to leave?" Cas: "Where to?" Cas thinks he's already distained by human, he's dirty now, Heaven loathes any form distained by human, e.g. Nephilim, he doubts if Heaven would still want him in, or he can make wings heal to good again to fly back to Heaven. (during torture, some/a lot of his grace is drained, wound on the neck)
>
> Dean sad, Cas not understand, talk a bit more. Dean apologizes for human race as a whole for hurting angels, hurting Cas specifically. Cas surprised Dean still believes in angel even tho no one here does anymore, appear to care about him. Dean talks about Mom and Sam, what he thinks should be the right way to live, upset and powerless about his neighbors, he's only still here for Sam. Cas amazed there is still at least one righteous man left in the city, regain hope at humanity
>
> Dean apologize again as himself, for bringing Cas more pain than before. Cas apologize for hurting him, uses the first bit of grace he recovers to heal Dean instead of himself, thank him for taking him away from other brutal humans. Dean wishes he can do more to help Cas, Cas says there is, and start kissing Dean, Dean kisses back (tapping into Dean's soul energy in intimate moment to recharge grace quickly). Two wounded little creatures in the city of sins holding onto each other.
>
> Dean unintentionally shows some sexual tendency/desire on Cas during kiss, e.g. frottage. Cas startled, pull away immediately, trauma violation triggered. Dean regret immediately, apologize, hurry out of the room

**Warning before chapter:** Mentions of accidental dub-con, accidental frottage, trauma trigger, PTSD

<br>

Cas is barely conscious for the first two days.

Dean doubts if he even realizes he's not in Martin's cellar anymore. Or that he's now lying on a real, proper bed, covered by Dean's throw blanket. It's not a luxurious smooth thing, but it's the best Dean can get for him, and it's warm.

He's not sure if the angel would prefer to be dressed in what way, either, so he merely cleans up the blood and other stains on his body, giving him a careful wipe all over, avoiding the wounds that look too nasty. He tucks Cas into his bed, making sure he lies in a comfortable posture, including his wings.

Cas's wings look awful. The limp wing bones droop against his shoulder blades, falling to the floor lifelessly. The left wing twists even worse, sticking out at the first joint. Sparse feathers hang on the wing bones pitifully, standing in all directions, many of them more or less burned, the dark black color coated with charred reddish brown.

Dean's fingers stroke gently against the feathers at the far ends, feeling his heart pained. The angel doesn't stir on the bed.

He gathers the courage to bury his fingers into the feathers, combing through them carefully, straightening them up. The soft sensation of the feathers soothes him, so he continues with it until the two wings look better.

He manages to put together a rough splint, too, from the leftover materials in a shop he helped once in a while. He hopes he's doing it right, instead of making it worse.

After all these are done, Dean sits in the chair next to the bed, just watching the angel.

Cas's breathing comes steadier after the first day.

And after the second, most of the open wounds on his skin are healed, leaving only shallow silvery tracks like scar tissue for the deep ones. Dean hesitates to check under the cover, but he does it anyway. The angel's skin is smooth and clean where the blood once covered. It earns a smile on Dean's face.

"You're beautiful, angel, did I tell you that?" Dean murmurs quietly, sitting back in the chair. His back hurts a little from sleeping on the chair two days in a row, but he thinks it doesn't matter.

Cas wakes up on the third day when Dean is having dinner in the dining room with his brother and his father. They all hear the tumbling sound from his room.

John narrows his eyes. "Did you forget to cuff him?"

Dean throws the bread back to the table, rushing to his room without answering.

Cas visibly winces when the door is opened and Dean walks in. He holds to the cover and shifts to the far end when Dean walks closer. His eyes flicker with confusion and guilt, shifting between the bedside table and Dean.

Dean follows his eyes. The cuffs and blade lie there. His heart clenches, kicking himself.

"I'm... I'm ready." Cas opens his mouth. His voice is husky.

"Ready for what?" Dean quietly takes those ugly torture tools away.

"Punishment," Cas answers readily, watching his moves. He flinches again when Dean moves closer to the bed with the tools in his hand, but as Dean slides them under the bed, out of sight, he tilts his head in confusion.

Cas asks him, "Are you not going to cuff me, or kill me? I did deserve that, after all."

Dean rubs his chest, trying vainly to release the tight sensation there. "No," he reassures him, lowering his voice. "I was just saying that so I could get you out. Now that you're awake and well again, you're free to go."

Cas blinks. "Where do I go?"

Dean frowns at him. "Heaven. Or, I don't know, where do you come from? Where's your home?"

Cas smiles bitterly. "Nowhere now," he answers drily. "I'm already distained by humans, I'm dirty now." He waves a hand at his body. "Heaven loathes any celestial form distained by mankind, that's why Nephilim is the biggest taboo. I doubt if Heaven would still want me in now."

His eyes meet Dean's. The lingering facsimile of a smile is still hanging there, but it's so bitter and sad that Dean can't breathe.

Dean is choked for a second before asking, "What about you fly there and try to ask them nicely? It's not your fault; maybe they'll forgive you."

Cas drops his eyes to his wings, even more sad. "They're burnt by the holy fire. I can't heal them. I don't think I can fly ever again." His eyes linger on the rough splints Dean made him, looking at them fondly. "I appreciate the help."

"There's gotta be something to help you!" Dean blurts out, teary-eyed.

Cas shifts his gaze to Dean, studying his face. "Why do you care so much?" he asks, genuinely curious. But Dean feels he's been kicked in the stomach again.

"I..." he doesn't really have a good answer. Or any answer at all. He struggles with words. "I think, the problem is not me, it's everyone who's not caring. I'm sorry for everyone hurting you. I'm sorry for the whole city."

"Dean," Cas says simply, one word but full of meaning.

Dean hasn't finished. "I'm sorry that none of them have faith or believe in angels anymore." He shakes his head, lowering his eyes, feeling ashamed for being a human in this city, among those others.

Cas looks at him, without blinking. "But you still do?"

"Yes," Dean answers easily. "Always. I'm not like them."

"May I ask why?" Cas goes.

Dean sits down on the edge of the bed, thinking, memorizing. It's been a while since he talked about this -- if he ever did. "My mom passed away when I was young," he starts slowly, staring at the wall behind Cas, unfocused. "It's been so long that I think I'm starting to forget what she looks like, but I always remember what she taught me. She taught me to always be kind to my neighbors, be good to the elderly, care for everyone like they're all my brothers; she taught me to have faith, that the Lord my God had plans for everyone. So I don't need to be scared when she was dying, she said we'll meet again, in Heaven, if I continued to believe, to serve the Lord. She said angels are watching over me, every night before I went to bed, and I believed."

Cas listens quietly, eyes bright and hopeful.

Dean glances at him sheepishly. "It must be childish, hearing a human talk like this. You're an Angel, after all."

Cas shakes his head gently. "It's fascinating," he tells Dean, soothing him. "It's beautiful. I'd like to learn more."

So Dean continues, "I tried to teach Sammy -- my baby brother -- the same. He was even younger when mom died, so he didn't remember much. I tried to teach him what mom taught me, and I think he's decent. Not as believing as I am, but so much better than everyone else. I just hope dad could stop... " he takes a breath there, stopping himself, and restarting the sentence. "Anyway, I think that should be the right way to live, to keep everyone safe and at peace. I hope the whole world is like this." He fidgets with his fingers uneasily.

Cas watches him, answering slowly. "But not the whole world is like this."

Dean huffs with frustration, shaking his head. "I can't even make one neighbor change. I tried, I really tried. But I don't know why, everyone in this city is like what they described as 'sinned'. I thought about leaving the city."

"Why didn't you?"

Dean flashes a glare at his room door. "I asked, but Dad said Sammy is not well enough to travel. And I'm still too young to make the decision for the family. I'm only here for Sam." His frown deepens slightly. "I just hope I know what his illness is. I tried everything, all the doctors, medicines, and herbs. But it seems all of them are just helping him to stabilize, but none of them are fully healing him."

"What's your theory?" Cas shifts in his position.

"Mom said that must also be God's plan; we don't need to know, just have to do our best. I think it might be some punishment, for what I didn't do good enough, or dad's... I'm trying so hard to compensate for it for all of us, by doing good, saving people." He lowers his head again, his voice especially quiet at the last words.

"By saving angels." Cas realizes. "You hope, by saving me, it can help your brother."

"Yes --" Dean looks up, finding the angel's hurt eyes. He adds quickly, "No! Shit! Cas, sorry, that's not what I mean. I care about you, not just for that!"

Castiel fumbles under the cover, pulling it down slightly, making an effort as if he tries to sit up. And Dean thinks, *He looks like he's trying to leave.* His eyes start burning hot.

"Cas, I'm sorry! It came out wrong. I'm not using you or anything," Dean rushes, panicked. Words tumbling in his mouth, stop making sense. He doesn't know how to fix it, and he's scared. He reaches out to hold the angel's hand across the cover.

Castiel looks at him kindly, with a look more like angels now -- more distant, more grand. "It's okay, Dean. I understand. Caring for your brother, it's nothing to be ashamed of. It makes you righteous. I'm glad to see there is still at least one righteous man left in the city; it might still have hope."

Dean nods numbly, wetting his dried lips, not finding it soothing.

Castiel pulls himself up from the bed, straightening to lean on the headboard.

Dean's eyes flicker down at the angel's elegant, bare torso. The color of the skin is a healthy tan now, without the discoloring or the paling from blood loss. His chest lifts and falls as he breathes, showing vague lines of muscle on his abdomen.

Dean swallows, forcing his eyes to stay on the bedside table instead. He tries hard to ignore the heat pulling at his groin.

"Are you..." he hears himself ask. "Are you leaving now?"

He sees Castiel shake his head from the peripheral of his eyes. The angel answers plainly, "My grace is not strong enough. I will need more time to heal before I can even leave this bed."

Dean nods mechanically. "I'm sorry," he says again, realizing he's using this sentence quite a lot today. "If it's not for me, you wouldn't have to face my dad like that. I'm sorry for causing more pain. I haven't thanked you for giving me that dose of grace -- you could have used it yourself."

"If we're counting the mistakes, then I'm sorry for hurting you in the first place," Castiel replies formally. "You already thanked me by taking me away from those other humans."

Dean chuckles, with some difficulty. "Sounds like we're squared, then."

"Yes. We don't owe each other anything now," the angel answers with a nod.

*That's not what I mean.* Dean thinks bitterly, wiping his face in frustration. He doesn't want them to "not owe each other." He doesn't want Cas to look at him like he's just one of the millions of humans, just like Cas isn't just one of the many angels.

Dean starts slowly, choosing words carefully, "When I first saw you that day, outside the gate, I saw the real, complete you. I saw the light surrounding you, lighting you up; I heard the thunder when you first set foot on the land; in the shadow of the sand and morning fog, I still saw your wings, beautiful and powerful." He takes a slow breath, decidedly not to glance at the angel to see his reaction to his words, but he can still feel the gaze on his skull. "The sun was rising in the east, and you came from the west. I remember thinking, right then, I was so glad I believed in you, because you were like the sun, you were even brighter than the sun. That day when I had to leave, I remember thinking, praying that I could see you again."

He looks up then, running into a pair of eyes so blue that the sky would be ashamed of its color. It's just like his eyes on the first day. Dean swallows, but forces himself to continue, "Then I came back, and they told me you were gone. It destroyed me like the sun was taken away from me. I spent days looking for you, I searched the whole city for you, because deep down, I think, I believe you would still be here. The sun wouldn't be so easily dimmed, nor will you. I'm so glad I found you again. I just wish I could do something more to help you. Anything you ask, I'll do it."

He swallows again, waiting. His heart pounds so loud in his chest that he's afraid he can hear nothing but blood pulsing in his ear.

Cas smiles. It's a full blossom smile, spreading across his face like spring arriving in the Valley, like warm wind carrying the fragrance of the honey and milk. The hard edges and guards that were in his eyes minutes ago soften away, melting into a pure, genuine happiness. He smiles, and he says, "There is."

He tells Dean there is one way that can recharge his grace quickly, help him heal faster.

"Anything," Dean says promptly. "What do you need from me?"

"It's your soul, Dean," Cas says, still holding their gaze with that bright smile. "Your soul is so bright when you were saying that. I think, connecting with your soul energy can fill my missing grace."

"What should I do?"

Cas reaches out a hand to land on Dean's arm. "Come closer," he whispers quietly.

Dean leans in, but then his legs get in the way of getting even closer. He moves onto the bed and practically sits on the angel's lap.

Cas's eyes focus on his lips.

Dean swallows, nodding once, dropping his eyes to stare at the angel's lips.

Cas's hand moves behind Dean's ear, pressing their lips close.

A warm flow leaps up from his spine, rising all the way to his scalp, making his whole body shiver.

Cas's lips are dry and cracked, but softer than they look. Automatically, Dean kisses back, caressing the angel's lips with his lips and tongue, licking him with a dip of wetness. Cas opens his mouth slightly. Dean's tongue slides in.

Even Dean can feel that open channel of energy flow now. There is electricity shaking his heart, sending shivers to his brain, his lips, all over his body.

He sits closer, grasping Cas's hair behind his ears, pulling their bodies together. The angel's bare chest presses against his, with only his thin tunic standing in between. Dean moves his hips unconsciously, melting in the overwhelming sensation, edging closely. He spreads his legs wider, automatically rubbing his arousal against the clothes, looking for friction.

Cas makes a startled sound at that, gasping loudly for air, pushing his chest hard, pulling away with wild, panicked eyes. His body is shivering involuntarily.

Dean freezes at the sudden change, opening his eyes in confusion.

The angel's eyes land on his bulge under the tunic, dragging the throw blanket to cover his body. "No, not you too," he gasps, putting more distance between them on the bed. Rage and humiliation flash by his eyes, followed closely by fear.

*Oh, God.* Dean remembers the way Cas lies helplessly in that cellar, naked, with his hands cuffed to the wall. The room smelt of blood and come. He remembers decidedly not to think of the dried white stains on his body when he was cleaning him up. He remembers the way those two people, Martin and Arthur, talked about him outside the door, when they had just finished violating him.

Cas is looking at him like he's one of those people.

*Oh God. What has he done?*

Dean stumbles off the bed, stepping back until his back is pressed to the farthest wall. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," he murmurs, repeating it, feeling the words taste dry and bloody on his tongue. The words are pale; the words don't do anything except for being just words. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. I truly --"

"Go," Castiel closes his eyes, leaning his head on the headboard.

"I --"

"Get out," the angel snaps, clenching the blanket desperately, as if hoping this can stop his body from shaking. Dean wants nothing more than to soothe his shoulder, pat his back, hold him in his arms in a hug, tell him he's safe, but he doesn't dare to do any of that. He doesn't think he's allowed anymore.

"Please," Castiel adds, slightly softer. His eyes are shut tight, refusing to look at him again. His face is in pain, as if all that has happened to him in the past days is flashing back before his eyes.

Dean never resents himself more than in this moment.

He flees out of the room.

<br>

#### draft notes

John gives Dean knife and let him go in there alone, silently suggested he can do anything to Cas like the way everyone does, violate him then kill him, that's all okay, only need to let John know once Dean's done (John thinks that's why Dean insists to have him)

Two wounded little creatures in the city of sins holding onto each other.

~~Dean heartbroken, think Cas is hurt more bc of him, self-blame~~

~~Dean upset and powerless about his neighbors~~

### (Chap 6) VI. The Brother and the Father

> Dean has to find excuses everyday to explain to John why he's not killing Cas yet, lie that he's torturing Cas to let him pay so John doesn't get suspicious, John proud he's getting better at torturing. Sam knows he's lying, secretly ask why Dean doesn't tell John truth but Dean too resigned to confront John.
>
> Sam wants to meet Cas, Dean doesn't think Cas's ready/well enough, afraid he'd be triggered by stranger and start attacking again.
>
> Sam still weak from some sickness, not fully recovered. John suggests Dean taking Cas's grace to feed Sam to see if it can help, Dean doesn't want, John: "You value that thing more than your own brother?" Dean hates it puts him in choice. avoid Cas more. (Sam talks to him some, suggest support him either way, Sam attitude neutral indifferent to angels)
>
> Dean doesn't interact much with Cas after that hurried leave, avoid him, afraid getting things worse, except for continue providing food/water/bandage/vial with his grace, giving Cas space, hoping him recover by himself. sometimes secretly observe Cas from entrance, want to talk but doesn't know how to, watch Cas facing small window watching sky, think Cas doesn't know he's observing him. Cas actually notices

The door to his room feels like a mountain too tall to climb over now, or a gate leading to a completely unknown realm. It scares him more than it reasonably should.

Dean nails his feet to the floor, stopping himself from trying to move closer to that door, to open it, to walk in.

He reminds himself of the angel's eyes when he last left. It stops any thought of going back in.

He stops himself from even glancing in that direction, not thinking about the angel.

*When the angel recovers well enough, he'll just leave.* He thinks.

He wonders how long it would take, for him to gather enough courage to open that door again and find the room empty. His room has a small window, facing the street, covered by the shades. Cas can leave from there, quiet enough not to let any of them know.

Then he realizes he's thinking about the angel again.

He pins his fingernails into his palm, hissing in the pain. It stops that train of thought quite effectively. *Cas must hate him just like he hates all those other men in the city, anyway. At the end of the day, he proved himself to be just like any other man of Sodom.*

Dean feels his chest tight and pained again, his blood running cold, just from those thoughts, those realizations. But he lets them wind round and round in his mind, to remind himself what he has done, what he has become. Not as if he can forget.

He still works the chores at the house, prepares meals for his father and his brothers, collects herbs for his brother's medicines, helps in the town shops when they can use extra hands and pays with bread. He eats, he walks, he sleeps, but he stops living.

At dinner, he chews the bread mechanically, swallowing without tasting it. His father and his brother are talking, but he's not listening. But he looks up when their conversation pauses, and he realizes their eyes are on him.

John's eyes are searching his face, and Sam's attention is back to the food.

"You hear what I said, Dean?" John asks with narrowed eyes.

"Sorry?" Dean murmurs, blinking blankly.

"Something on your mind?"

"No, Sir. Just tired," Dean answers automatically.

John tilts his head toward Dean's closed room. "You still got that angel in there?"

Dean's eyes flash toward the tight door, putting down the bread slowly. "Yes." *Maybe.* He thinks, but he knows it won't satisfy his father. He'd rather not answer more questions.

"Why haven't you killed him yet?" John's eyes are sharp like eagles, hovering around his face like searching for prey.

"I'm still torturing him." Dean makes an effort to swallow the food, answering, prepared. He forces his eyes to lock with John's, so that his father wouldn't get suspicious. "He has to pay. It's more punishment than just death."

"Are you trying different ways to torture him? Learning about those sigils that can cause them pain?" John looks at him, expectantly.

"Yes," Dean answers, reminding himself to blink, to act naturally. He thinks he's getting better at lying, and it gives his stomach a slump. But it's better than getting good at torturing angels. He wonders if that's why lying isn't on the Ten Commandments.

"Good," John curls his lips slightly, approving. "Those are useful skills. You are finally becoming one of us. You should teach Sam those knowledge, too, and practice on the angel you got, now that we have one for free."

Dean gives his father a faint smile and a small nod, stuffing his mouth with bread again so that he doesn't have to keep talking.

"I know you were lying," Sam whispers to him when it's only the two of them left. John said he'd be out for a few hours once the dinner was over. He didn't say where to or what he'd be doing. Dean didn't ask.

Dean pretends he's too focused on watching the jars and pots to hear him. Sam leans on the wall next to him, watching him from the side.

Dean can't keep pretending he doesn't see his brother, but he waits for another minute to pass before answering. "Yeah?"

Sam has a knowing look on his face. "I'm a patient, doesn't mean I'm an idiot. You might fool dad, but you're not fooling everyone in the room. I know you."

He's a clever kid. And they spend more time with each other than either of them does with their father. Of course he knows.

Dean cleans the last of the jugs that were actually clean to start with, puts them down on the counter, and turns to Sam. "What do you think you know?" he asks, almost like a challenge.

"That you're not torturing the angel, or have any plan to kill him," Sam says confidently.

"Is that so?" Dean turns to give the dining table a wipe, picking up the crumbs.

Sam follows him, not letting him get out of sight. "You left the angel in your room, then you barely got back to your room. You occupy yourself with all the work, and you sleep on the floor or chair every day," he points out acutely.

The kid is observant and clever. Dean almost feels proud of him, if he didn't use it to keep track of him.

"Are you gonna tell dad?" Dean asks him, gripping the rag in his head a little too tight as he wipes the table.

"No," Sam tells him, voice quiet. "But why don't you? Thought you tried for years to persuade everyone to be kind to each other, to angels."

Dean lets out a short huff. "And see what it does -- Jack Squat. You're probably the only one ever remembers I said anything."

"Well, I don't have many other people telling me things," Sam answers plainly. That's the fact, and the fact still makes them a little wordless. They fall quiet for a moment.

Dean finds out he runs out of excuses to walk around and distract himself, so he turns to his brother. "Why aren't you resting yet? You're exhausting yourself."

Sam is biting his tongue, hesitating over something.

Dean narrows his eyes in question. "What?"

"Can I meet him? The angel?" Sam glances at his room's door. Dean's eyes follow.

"No," Dean answers automatically, before his reasonable mind could come up with a good enough reason.

"Why?"

Dean rubs the back of his neck. "He's... he's still hurt from before," he frowns, thinking hard. "Like you, I think he's still too weak to see anyone."

Sam reads his face carefully, seems to interpret his frown to a completely different meaning. "If you're worried I'll hurt him, don't be. I just want to talk. I've never seen an angel before."

Dean pulls up a faint smile, "Yeah, no, more like the other way round. I'd be more worried he might hurt you. Accidentally, I mean."

"I thought you said they're good. All these times when you try to tell people not to hurt them, you said they should be saved. Now you are making him sound... dangerous." Sam frowns slightly, confused.

"Of course they are, yes, they're good. But... " he bites his tongue, remembering the fierce look in the angel's eyes before he grabbed the blade and lunged into Martin. If it wasn't him on the way, if he wasn't so wounded and weak, that blade would definitely cut through where it was aiming -- not that he blames Cas for it, hell, he wanted to do it for him if he's allowed. Then he remembers the startled flinch when Dean first walked back into his room, finding the angel awake; the shiver and shake, when he accidentally... Dean runs a hand over his face. "He's not ready, alright? Just give some time, for both of you. You need to rest and get stronger, too."

"I'm feeling good!" Sam pouts, curving his arms, trying to show his thin muscles in his biceps. "See? I *am* strong."

Dean chuckles slightly, patting his arms. "Okay, okay, I get your point. I'll talk to him sometime, alright? If both of you are ready, I'll introduce you guys to meet. Happy?"

"Thank you," Sam nods, genuinely pleased.

Dean finds himself in a better mood than at any time in the past week. He's even humming as he skims through some books he borrowed from the shop.

He sees to it that his brother gets to bed early and rests, and goes back to doze off on the lazy chair near the dining table.

<br>

Dean is woken by a violent fit of coughing.

Sam's whole body is shaking as he coughs. Dean places a clay pot next to his bed, holding his shoulders, patting his back slowly.

The cough shortly turns into vomiting. The liquid is blended with blood.

It looks like he can't breathe, and he can't keep anything down in his stomach.

It looks like he's dying.

Dean's heart is squeezed so tight that he can't breathe, as well. But he makes sure his hands are steady when he holds his brother, and thinks silently and desperately, *Please, Lord has mercy. Please, save him, spare him from the pain and sickness. He's just a kid. He's my brother. I don't know what to do without him.*

He doesn't know how long it has passed, but finally, Sam quiets down. Dean doesn't know if it's the wave of the illness passed or his prayer has been answered.

Sam breathes heavily through his mouth, leaning back at the headboard, panting. Sweat covers his forehead.

Dean wipes his mouth and moves the pot away. He brings a bowl of water for his brother to rinse and drink.

"Better?" he studies Sam's face. The kid is almost seventeen now, but he looks too thin and small for his age. His jaw has a sharp curve, as if he's been starving all this time. Dean sighs silently. He already tried his best, feeding his brother with everything he could manage.

Sam drinks some more water before putting the bowl down. Dean has to help hold the bowl for him so that his shaky hands wouldn't drop the thing. The kid's fingers are weak and cold.

"It's never been this bad," Sam murmurs quietly, his voice rough.

"I'll see if I can get you some soup tomorrow," Dean tells him, frowning deep. He doesn't get much sleep for the rest of the night, waking up every few moments to listen to his brother's breathing.

Their father doesn't come back until the next morning. Dean has already cleaned the blood-stained pot.

The soup has little help, except for being delicious.

Sam coughs up blood again, this time, during dinner.

John watches with a frown as Dean holds the same pot, stroking his brother's back up and down until it passes again.

"Didn't you say the angel's grace helped you heal?" John says suddenly, watching Dean busy around the house.

Dean's heart sinks, already seeing where this conversation would go. He does not answer.

John answers it for himself. "Martin said one moment that cut was so deep you were dying, the next, you got some angel grace in you and all the cuts were gone. Why don't you get some more of that stuff from the angel we got, feed Sammy some, see if it helps?"

Dean clenches the rag hard in his hand, knuckling against the kitchen counter, standing with his back to his father, not answering. He should have seen this coming.

John doesn't like his silence, walking up to him, pulling his shoulder to turn him around. "You heard me, boy?"

"Yes," Dean has to say. "I hear you."

"So you're going to do that, right? It should be pretty easy; I saw Arthur did that once before. Just cut his throat and get the grace into a jar, that might be the solution for your brother's illness." John stares him down.

Dean shuts his eyes tight, his breath caught in his throat. Now he knows where that long cut on Cas's throat comes from.

He doesn't answer.

But that's already enough defiance in his father's eyes. John shakes his shoulder, making him have to open his eyes again.

Dean runs into a pair of glaring eyes.

"What? You value that thing more than your own brother?" John snaps.

Tears start gathering in his eyes.

"Of course I want Sammy healed," he says in a hoarse voice. So pained that each syllable a cut on his throat.

His father is pleased. John's hand leaves his shoulder. "Good," he says, glancing at the locked door, then looking back at him. "Do it then. We'll see if Sammy gets better tomorrow."

He leaves the house for the night again.

Dean sits down slowly against the wall outside his room, burying his face between his hands, staring at the floor between his knees. He presses his eyess with the heels of his palms, so he can stop more tears from coming down.

He can't do it to the angel. But he can't let his brother suffer and die, too.

*God, please,* he whispers to the air, then propping his head skyward, *What should I do? Help me save both of them. Please. Why do I have to choose between them?*

The God he believes does answer. Sam does.

"You don't have to do it," Sam tells him from his lying position. "Tomorrow we'll just tell dad it doesn't work, we'll have to figure something else out. Or you know, just accept it." His tone sounds more mature than ever, shaking slightly from the rough throat, but steady from the meaning. "I'm okay with it."

Dean lets out a whimper sound. "I'm not," he answers.

"Mom would say it's all just part of the Lord's plan, right?" Sam tries to soothe him.

For the first time, Dean thinks bitterly, *Screw the plan. I just want my brother alive.*

"I would do anything to save you, you know I would," Dean tells him slowly. "So Lord forgive me."

He gets up, and opens the door to his room.

This is the second time he resents his soul.

<br>

### (Chap 7) VII. The Soul

> Cas calls Dean before he can leave secretly again. Dean enters, keeps distance, self-aware, afraid of hurting Cas accidentally again, mentally or physically. Cas sees it, reaches to kiss Dean. Dean reciprocates, but: "Does it help?" Cas raises eyebrow, Dean was thinking the kiss is only for tapping his soul to help Cas recharge and heal. Cas sighs and tells him how different he is to anyone else and that he hears conversations upstairs, Dean doesn't need to fear to hurt him, except for the sexual activities that he's not ready again.
>
> Cas's wings are healing, Dean caresses the feathers, awed, love it, more ashamed for other sinned humans, ashamed of himself too for thinking of hurting Cas to save Sam, want to save Sam and everyone. Cas amazed/touched by him again, even angel/Heaven has given up on these people, ready to destroy these people instead of saving them, but Dean's still trying to change them. Cas suggest meet Sam

Castiel is standing before the window, looking outside. The shade is half open.

It's dark outside. Dean knows there isn't much view to see, for he has stood in the exact spot staring at the street before.

But the angel is standing there, stiffly straight, without moving an inch. Like a perfectly still statue.

He's wearing the black tunic he came with on the first day. Dean assumes he must have found the cloth bundle under the bed, along with all the broken feathers, that Dean picked and held so close to his chest once.

Then he remembers how torn it was. But now it seems all perfectly fixed.

It must also be one of the angel's abilities, then, he guesses.

Castiel doesn't show a sign that he hears the door opening.

Dean stands at the thin slit of the opening, watching his back. The tunic covers his body, but doesn't hide his wings. The burned feathers are not healing, but the torn and broken ones are. The broken joints are no longer limping lifelessly behind his back. Instead, they are now stretching upward, holding newly grown feathers. Dean can tell they are young feathers because the color is a shade lighter than the rest.

He stares at them, fascinated.

And his courage runs thin just as quickly as he gathers it.

Dean bites his bottom lip hard, trying to close the door without making a sound.

Then he hears the angel call him.

"Dean," Castiel says, with his deep voice, before turning back from the window.

His face is half hidden in the shadow of his wings. The dim bedside oil lamp barely lights half the room, the flame flickering as the wings carrying wind when he moves.

Dean freezes in his attempt to leave.

"Cas -- Castiel," Dean answers numbly, stepping slowly into the room. His hand lingers on the door handle.

"You haven't come for days." The angel moves closer, folding his wings, so that more light gets cast on Dean's face.

Dean dodges his eyes. "I don't want to disturb your rest," he mumbles. *I don't know if you'd still be here. I thought you'd hate me.* His mind supplies.

Castiel tilts his head slightly to the side, studying his face. "I rested very well, thank you," he answers kindly, then, "I missed you."

Dean startles, jerking his head up, caught in the angel's eyes. His throat forgets how to work. His hand automatically closes the door behind him. "We didn't exactly part as friends last time," he blurts out, pressing his back against the door, as if trying to keep himself as far away from the angel as possible. As if, he doesn't allow himself to get any closer.

*I hurt you.* He bites his bottom lip hard, thinking. *And now, I'm here to hurt you again.*

Cas moves closer, shaking his head. "It wasn't your fault," his voice is quiet. "I should know you didn't mean it. It... it's not your fault."

They are standing mere inches away now. Dean swallows, glancing at the angel, unsure of himself. He can see the flickering eyelashes and the change of color in the angel's pupils. He sees his own reflection. *When did they move this close?*

His breath speeds up when Cas's gaze drops to his lips. He swallows again, and closes his eyes.

Cas's lips move to the corner of his lips, stroking carefully. Dean reaches out automatically to hold him, rounding behind his back, holding between his shoulder blades. His fingers run into the angel's wings.

Cas makes a small contented sigh, drinking his lips more fiercely, pressing him against the door, holding his head. Dean feels the flow of warmth rise from his spine again, pumping in his veins along with every beat of his heart. He lets his body relax, letting Cas take control.

Time and space stretch around them, losing meaning.

When Cas pulls back, they are both panting. The room settles back around them.

Dean can see his own reflection in the angel's dilated pupils. But he doesn't know how to read the other things in there, so he turns his head away, staring at the bed instead.

Cas moves back slightly, giving him more space.

"Does it help?" Dean stutters.

"What?" Cas raises his eyebrows.

"My soul." Dean draws small circles on his chest where the heart is, as if pointing at where his soul is. "That's... that's for connecting with my soul to help you heal, isn't it?" *What else can it be?* His mind says.

Cas sighs, taking a step back, running a hand through his rustled hair. Dean finds it such a human move.

"No, it's not," Cas tells him. Dean doesn't understand.

"It's not *just* to help me heal." Cas clarifies. "I hear it's human's expression for many things: appreciation, admiration, care."

Dean blinks slowly. "You..." he stares at the angel as if he just grew two more heads or three more arms. "It can't be. You're an angel, and I'm..." his voice trails off. *I'm just a human. I'm nobody. I'm Son of John, citizen of the sinned city of Sodom.*

"You're different from anyone else I've ever seen, and I've seen every human since my Father created the light. And yet, you're the most beautiful, the brightest soul of them all." Cas tells him, stroking a hand beside his cheek. Dean leans into it, still holding their gaze, breathing shallow.

"Even in a city like this, you haven't stopped trying to save people, to save angels. You are truly a righteous man." Cas leans in again, more gently this time, searching for his lips. "That makes you just as powerful and special as an angel, and even more."

Dean whimpers quietly, letting the thumb of the angel wipe away his tears. He doesn't know when they gather or when they fall. He only sees Cas's gentle eyes, and he holds him tight. He kisses back carefully.

"I'm sorry." When they pause to take a breath, Dean says, leaning his forehead against Cas's, his fingers fumbling from the angel's cheek to his throat, searching quietly. He doesn't find a cut there now.

"What for?" Cas asks, pulling back slowly.

"I was thinking about hurting you again, when I came into the room," Dean confesses, ashamed of himself. "I was desperate to save my brother. But don't worry, I'll go look for another way."

Cas catches Dean's fingers in his palm, stopping his search. "You don't have to worry about hurting me. I trust you mean well. Why don't you let me meet Sam? Maybe there is something I can do for him, like you did for me."

Dean widens his eyes in surprise and joy. He nods, relief and hope filling his chest. "Yeah, yeah -- Sam would like that, too."

#### Act 1

Dean leads Sam into his room. The young boy is so nervous that he doesn't know where to put his hands.

Castiel greets him gently, holding out a hand. "I'm Castiel, Angel of the Lord," he announces. Dean has a sudden throwback to the moment they first met. Castiel was so much more solemn and distant at the time.

Sam catches the angel's hand, holding it closely. "Sam, I'm Sam," he eagers.

Cas gives him a smile. "Dean has told me much about you." He takes back his hand, pressing two fingers together, reaching for Sam's forehead. "I'm going to check what is going on with your body."

Sam nods hastily, closing his eyes.

Cas presses his fingers and closes his eyes, too. Dean watches a frown slowly forming between his eyebrows.

A glow of silvery light gathers from his body, moving through his fingers, sinking through Sam's skin.

Sam's standing stance slowly straightens, his cheeks flushing healthy pink.

Cas staggers backward two steps, leaning against the bed. Dean reaches out to hold his shoulders in time.

"What's happening? How's it going?" Dean looks between the angel and his brother.

While Sam looks better, Cas looks worse. He grimaces when Dean helps him to sit down at the edge of the bed; he pants heavily. His face looks more pale, too.

"How do you feel?" Cas doesn't answer Dean, looking up at Sam and asking him instead.

Sam stretches his arms easily, taking a few long breaths, starting to grin. "I'm feeling great!" he says cheerfully. "I feel... so light. Like there was always something here," he points at his chest, "but now they're gone. I'm breathing okay, I don't feel anything now."

"That's... that's so great." Dean watches him, having a matching tearful smile on his face. He looks back at the angel, "God, I prayed for you for so long, and in the end, it's you, Cas. You're the one who saved him."

He pulls Cas closer, trying to give him a hug. Cas lets out a soft moan under his touch.

Dean freezes again, letting go of his hold slowly. "How are you, Cas?"

Cas leans back, not leaving his touch, so Dean puts his hands back around Cas's back. "Just tired," Cas puts up a faint, sad smile. "I might accidentally have used up most of my grace. I still wasn't as strong as I'd like. But I promised you, Dean, to do as much as I can to help your brother."

"You idiot," Dean scolds him gently. "You want to tap on me again?" He flashes a sheepish glance at Sam when he says that, then the door. Dean blushes slightly.

Cas shakes his head. "I don't want to exhaust you. Soul energy is not unlimited, and it recovers even slower than grace. I should just take some rest and let my grace heal itself."

"Alright," Dean helps him lie down on his bed.

Sam stands awkwardly by the wall, watching them.

There is some sound outside the room, but none of them notices.

"If it's okay," Sam starts slowly, "I have a question."

"Dude, he's tired," Dean throws him an irritated look. "Questions can wait till the morning."

"It's okay, Dean." Cas catches his hand that's helping to tuck him in with the throw blankets, turning his face to Sam. "What do you want to know?"

Sam glances between his brother and the angel nervously. "I was just wondering, why do you come to us in the first place? As an angel, why do you come to the city?"

"To inspect the town, right? You said so yourself on the first day," Dean answers for him, then turning to Cas for confirmation.

Cas makes a small nod. "But that's not all. I couldn't tell you the whole truth, but now, I think it's okay for you to know."

Dean frowns slightly. He doesn't quite like how it sounds. "What's the whole truth?" he asks, worried.

"The sinned fame of the City of Sodom and Gomorrah has reached the Heavenly host. We're sent to inspect the city, to see if the rumors were true, and to report back our conclusion. Amos and I reach the city one day apart, so that we can each inspect individually." Castiel tells them.

"Amos... that's the angel before you." Dean murmurs, mournful. "I think he didn't make it."

Castiel nods sadly. "I didn't realize how severe the situation is. I should have listened to you, but at least, I'm glad I get to know everything on a very deep level and report back accurately."

"What are you going to report? Once you go back?" Sam prompts carefully.

"The Heavenly host is determining if the city is worth saving. And if it's not, then the whole town will be destroyed." Cas answers, shifting his eyes between Dean and Sam. "But now that I learned about the existence of the righteous man and his family, I will let them know that, even though the city is as sinned as the rumor says, there is a righteous man that worth saving. I will make sure both of you are safe."

"They're going to destroy the whole town?" Dean widens his eyes, worried.

"Everyone except for you and Sam, yes."

"You can't... I don't know, tell them they're still worth saving?" Dean struggles, closing his eyes once in the mid-sentence, but he asks it anyway.

Castiel stares at him, eyes turning colder. "Given my own experience, with everything that has happened," his eyes flashing down at his body that's covered by the cover and his wings that are still weak, as if to remind Dean of all the harms that had occurred, "no, that wouldn't be an honest observation."

"But they're all people! All lives!" Dean raises his voice. "There are women and children in the city, too! Maybe ninety-nine out of a hundred people are sinned, there are still innocent people out there!"

"And that one person is right here, and no more." Cas looks him in the eyes. "Why do you think I spend three more days in the city, when I could have reported back on the first day?"

Dean is muted and simply stares at him. It didn't occur to him to ask why.

"I witnessed adultery and blasphemy on the first day from everyone except you. And I thought, perhaps you're not the only righteous man in the city, perhaps there's a second one, a third. If I can find ten, the city can be spared. So I stayed and tried, and this is how I ended up. So no, there is no second righteous man. I'm sorry."

"Maybe they can still be changed! People can change!" Dean's voice is bordering on yelling.

"I thought you wanted them punished, too. I thought you wanted to leave the city and never come back." Cas retorts.

"That doesn't mean all of them deserve to die!" Dean rushes, voice trembling. "Come on, Cas. There are thousands of people in the town, you can't really be thinking about destroying all of them!"

"Show me *one* example in the town that changed. You tried for years, telling them what's right and what's wrong, telling them to stop the adultery and start to have faith. Tell me *one* name, Dean, besides yourself and Sam, that changed and listened to you, and I will report back to tell them the city is worth saving." Cas says steadily.

"No --" Dean whines. But he can't give such a name, because there is none.

He turns to Sam for support with teary eyes. "Sam, come on, you're with me, right? Tell him that people can be changed!"

Sam hesitates.

There is another sound outside the door, like footsteps moving. He glances at the door once, then looks back at his brother.

"I don't know," he says reasonably. "I'm sorry. Maybe you're right, but maybe they're beyond saving. You have tried for at least ten years, and you're still the only one truly believing. I think that said a lot. I'm just trying to be realistic here."

Dean shakes his head, devastated.

"So... that destroying everything, it will happen after you go back and finish your report?" Sam asks hesitantly.

"Yes," Cas nods slowly. "I'm not able to fly back anymore, but once I'm well enough, once I can gather enough energy to inform one of my brothers and sisters, letting them hear me and pass my words for me. This will start."

"Then I'll make sure you never send out that report!" John breaks open the door and runs in, with a long blade in one hand and a carved brass knuckle in the other.

<br>

#### Act 2

"John." Castiel struggles to pull himself up from the bed, his face glum.

"No!" Dean stands next to the bed, between the angel and his father. He has not forgotten the last time the two of them were in the same room. He will not let that happen again, whatever happened to him.

"Dad, don't do this!" Sam goes to pull his father's arm, trying to drag him away.

"Sam, Dean, get out." John orders. His eyes are murderous. "I don't want either of you to get hurt. So get out. This is only for the angel. I heard everything."

"Then you know everything I have to report is exactly because of men like you," Castiel answers icily, pressing a palm at his chest, panting at the effort. He drags himself straight, leaning against the headboard. Dean has an arm wrapped across his chest, as if this should be enough armor to shield him against John.

"It doesn't matter, because you wouldn't be reporting anything back," John twists the blade in his hand, turning it from upward to downward. He strides into the room.

Dean covers Cas with his whole body. "You'll have to kill me first," he announces boldly.

"What kind of brainwash did the angel give you?" John growls, shoving him with the hand bearing the brass knuckles. The edge of the metal scratches across his shoulder, leaving a long trace of abrasion.

Dean hisses, but doesn't move. "The same kind that I always have -- Faith."

"Dean," Cas warns him, voice strained. His hand pushes on Dean's back feebly. "He might actually kill you."

"I don't care!" Dean bites, without looking back. "Shut up and let me save you!" His voice shaking violently.

"I'm doing this to save the whole town." John swings the knuckle again, leaving a long bruise below his chin. Dean thinks he hears his jaw breaking.

"You talk about saving people but now letting this angel condemn the whole town. You're not the hero here, I am." John snaps, punching Dean again. "Don't ever say I don't know what's sacrifice. I'm willing to sacrifice you to save the whole town!"

Dean loosens his fist, letting himself get beaten by his father. His body limps, being thrown in all directions that John hits him. He lands on top of the blanket. Blood drips from the corner of his mouth, staining the bed and the angel lying there.

"Stop!" Castiel yells, devastated. He folds his wounded wings around, trying desperately to cover Dean. "John! Stop! Kill me and spare him! He's your son!"

"Cas, don't!" Sam yells, throwing himself toward them, but John pushes him aside easily.

"No --" Dean whispers, his eyes can barely keep open from the bruises and swollen eyelids. Knuckle-shaped cuts spread nastily on his young face.

Castiel spreads his wings and tucks Dean behind, exposing himself to John.

"They will know," Castiel looks at the man, the rage in there has switched to pity and despise. "I don't survive this, others will come. Men like you, will never survive to see the new Earth. I pity you, John, for you can't see the Plan and the glory, but your son can."

John grits his teeth and waves the blade. "Shut up, angel, and just die."

He buries the blade into Castiel's chest.

The light inside the angel starts burning bright, flashing on and off as it's torn apart. His eyes start losing focus. A high-pitched sound starts echoing in the room. His folded wings loosen.

Dean struggles desperately to cup his hands on Cas's cheeks, holding his face between his palms.

"No no no no no -- Cas, don't! Please! Don't leave me! Don't!" He cries, screaming. He kisses the angel's slacking lips, licking and sucking. "Use my soul! Cas, come on! Use my soul! I love you!"

Cas's lips curl up a small degree at his words. His eyes refocus on Dean's face, smiling tiredly. "I love you, too." his voice broken and croaked, mixed in the shrieking sound surrounding them.

"If the city is worth saving, --" he says quietly, slowly, one word at a time. Dean leans on his body to capture each syllable. Cas's lips move right next to his ears. "-- it would be because of you."

The flashing light explodes.

When it dies down, all that remains before their eyes, is a lifeless body with two burned wings behind its back. The charred marks scorched into the bed and the wall behind them.

Dean cradles the angel's body in his arms, crying with broken pieces of his soul falling in his tears.

> Dean insists Bal to resurrect Cas, Bal makes it a deal: he can save Cas but Dean has to leave city (Sodom dies) or Dean stays and Cas dies (Sodom lives). Either way, Dean lives. Bal: "You said Sodom is worth saving, but everything comes with a price. Are those corrupted people out there who did this to him, worth his life? Are you going to exchange his life, for those ingratitude sinners?"
>
> Dean torn apart, cries hard, painful decision, refuse to choose either, too painful, start cursing angels/Heaven/God again, lost faith in angel/Heaven here, start getting angry and vicious, act as not care about saving the world again, counter proposal of killing himself and same both but not an option, eventually choose Cas
>
> high-pitch sound drops in, Michael speaks to Bal directly, Bal listens with pale face

*Please.*

Dean closes his eyes, pressing his lips on the cold forehead of the angel.

*Please hear me, Lord my God, Angels, anyone. Please.*

He rocks slightly in his kneeling position, holding the angel's body closer.

*Please save him. He's an Angel. He doesn't deserve this.*

Cas's body feels so thin and light in his touch. Dean's hand strokes his cheek, feeling his palm fit the sharp curve of his jaw.

*His name is Castiel. Please save him. Whatever it takes.*

He looks up at the ceiling, letting the tears fall. He forgets about everything around him, forgets about his father and his brother. He forgets himself.

*I'll do anything, as long as you bring him back. God, I'm Dean. Please hear me.*

A whip of wind swirls in the room, accompanied by the sound of flustering air. A man appears before the window, out of thin air.

Dean wipes away his tears carelessly with the back of one hand. The man has a pair of long black wings, just like Cas's. He folds his wings slowly as the stirred air in the room settles down.

"God?" he asks, voice choked.

"Nah, Dad's out of town lately. Guess again," the newcomer says in a cheerful voice, with an exotic accent.

"Angel." Dean lowers his eyes.

"Bingo. Name's Balthazar." The angel claps his hand, scanning the room, then his gaze falls on the body in Dean's arms. The blade that killed him was cast aside, bloody on the bed. "Oh dear, whatever happened here?"

"It's Cas -- Castiel. Can you save him?" Dean asks breathlessly.

Balthazar makes a face that shows he's thinking. "Yes, and no. We need to talk."

He snaps his fingers, and John and Sam fall to the floor. Dean startles.

"Don't worry, they'll just take a small nap," Balthazar explains, waving a hand carelessly.

Dean's attention turns back to the angel. "What do you mean, *'Yes and no'*? What do I have to do?"

"You see, it's a little bit out of convention to bring Cas back. I'll have to send in some application, waiting for Upstairs to approve, and *maybe* Boss will come to check out and ask, 'Why do you want him back alive?'"

"He's an angel!" Dean rushes reflexively.

"News flash, buddy, angel dies."

"He doesn't deserve to die!"

"Most people who died don't technically deserve to die -- well, some, maybe. Like this lot in this city. I'm gonna finish another errand just in a bit, by the way, now that I'm already in the town. I'll wait until you get out of town, though." Balthazar strolls casually before the window, glancing outside. The sky is slowly turning to dawn now. There are one or two people moving on the street. The city is waking up.

"What errand?" Dean straightens his posture, alarmed. His gut feeling already knows the answer.

"Destroy the city and everyone in it, of course. Upstairs already decided, and Cas didn't send in his report; that's enough proof for the trouble."

"Everyone? Sam, too?"

"Yes, yes, your brother, your father, your neighbor, the shop owner opposite the street. Every single one of the folks in the city -- except you." Balthazar waves a hand, explaining a little impatiently.

"Why?" Dean finds his throat dry like sandpaper.

"Surely Cas has told you about righteous man business? Boss promised Abraham to save the righteous men. We thought it was plural, but it turns out just means you. Anyway, you mean more to the Upstairs than you know, kid."

"I live, I die, I don't care," Dean says bitterly, shaking his head. "I just wanted others to live. Cas, Sam, I just want to save them. I even want to save those people if I can."

Balthazar squints his eyes, looking from Dean to the body, and considers. "What about we make it a deal? I resurrect your beloved angel Cas, and you leave the town, so I can finish the job and destroy the city and everyone in it; or, you stay as long as you like, Cas stays dead, the city lives, you get your dear brother and father and everyone in the city alive. That's a great deal, isn't it? Either way, you get to live."

Dean stares at him, tears coming down again, streaming across his cheek, wetting Cas's clothes. "You want me to agree to kill the whole city, including Sam, as my cost to save him?" his hands hold Cas's body closer to his chest. He struggles to breathe in his sobbing.

Balthazar shrugs. "I didn't say that, that's your choice. You think Sodom is worth saving, right? But everything comes with a price. Are those corrupted people out there, who, by the way, did everything horrible to him -- yes, yes, I heard -- worth his life? They tore him apart, condemned him to the Earth, burned his wings, and are you going to exchange his life, for those ungrateful sinners?"

Dean buries his head in the body's shoulder, wailing.

The pain of the option is nothing less cruel than asking him to kill Cas again, with his own hand. He has one chance to save Cas, but he has to weigh his life.

"It's not fair!" Dean cries out loud, torn apart. His heart is too painful to keep beating, yet he lives.

"Welcome to the real world," Balthazar replies nonchalantly.

"I can't, I can't," he moans and cries.

The choice should have been obvious -- a thousand people's lives for Cas. He can even imagine what Cas would say if he were here. But Dean doesn't care. He's dead anyway.

"Damn you!" he bites and curses. "Damn the angels! Damn Heaven! Damn God! Damn the whole world! Screw you!"

He yells and screams, stops caring about the angel who's still in the room, not caring that people outside might hear him.

He wails and howls, "This is what I get for believing for so long? Then screw the Lord! Screw the faith! Screw the whole world for all I care! The world never did me any good, the city never loved me. He did."

Dean looks at Balthazar, desperate and completely broken. He says, eventually, "I choose him. I choose Cas. Resurrect him, please."

He says, quieter, "But I'm not leaving the city. If you are to destroy Sodom, kill me with it. I don't deserve to live after all, for condemning every living soul here. I'll burn with the city among my brother and father."

Dean waits for Balthazar to smile wild with victory while snapping a finger to make it work. But instead, the smile drops from the angel's face. He looks scared for a second, and then the brightest white light pours from the sky, dawning over him through the ceiling, speaking to him in a volume so loud and pitch so high that the whole house shakes.

Balthazar's face pales. He looks upward to the light, eyes locked to the center, listening to the high-pitched voice.

"Michael," he murmurs, in utter awe.

<br>

### (Chap 10) X. Save the Angel

> Bal gets scolded by Michael directly (for forcing Dean lose faith), terrified solemn face, drop joke face, resurrects Cas, mojos him clean, fixes his wings and other unseen tears, murmurs by his ear then disappears
>
> Cas/Dean hug/kiss, Dean cries again, Cas looks at him sad. Dean asks what Bal said, Cas says Bal went off preparing for the weapon to destroy the city like they planned, but by choosing Cas and condemn the city, Dean isn't righteous man anymore, they're allowed to destroy the city with him in it. Dean: "He did say 'Everything comes with a price'", thinks it means he'd have to die, he doesn't regret choose to save Cas
>
> fire and sulphur start dropping into city, Cas makes his decision, disobeys order, offers to fly Dean/Sam out of city. Dean doesn't think he deserves anymore, Cas: "You always deserve saving." Sam pleads to bring John too, Cas thins lips, Dean doesn't know if he'd be happy about it, Cas warns them not to look back and flies them to Zoar

The white light flares stronger as the pitch climbs higher. Balthazar lowers his head, face terrified and solemn, answering incoherently. "Yes... I'm sorry... I understand... Consider it done."

Dean watches the scene unfold before him numbly, not understanding.

And then the shaking of the floor eases, so does the piercing sound.

The white light dims slowly, but hasn't fully faded.

Balthazar finally lifts his head, waving at him eagerly. "Come, quickly. Put Cas in here."

Dean follows the order automatically, holding Cas close to his chest as he walks over to the window. The sun has risen, but the light from the ceiling is a thousand times brighter. He lays Cas's body down in the center of the light, smoothening his wings.

Balthazar watches him intensely, frowning hard.

Dean doesn't dare to blink.

And then, just like a snap of a finger, Cas gasps for air and opens his eyes. He sits up slowly. His night-black wings stretch beautifully and healthily behind him as the white light goes off.

"Cas!" Dean breathes out, tears tumbling down.

"Hey buddy," Balthazar gives him a small wave of his hand.

Cas stands up from the floor, frowning with light confusion, checking himself up. He's clean and bright, beautiful without any wounds.

"Balthazar," he sees the angel first. "Did you...?"

"Not me," Balthazar points a finger toward the sky. "Thank the Boss. Michael's direct order."

Cas frowns deeper. "What's the cost?" he asks quickly. "What else did he say?"

Balthazar casts a quick glance at Dean, leaning in to whisper something in Cas's ear.

Dean sees him wriggling his eyebrows as he pulls back.

"I'll see you around, Cas," Balthazar leaves one last sentence and another cheesy smile of his, turning to Dean. "Dean." He gives him a nod, and disappears with another whip of wind, just like when he appeared.

Cas turns slowly to Dean, opening his mouth.

Dean throws himself to the angel before he can say anything, and kisses him like this is the end of the world. Cas hums softly and holds him tight, but he pulls back after a short beat.

"Wait, Dean," he stops him.

Dean licks his lips, swallowing. The angel's beautiful, blue eyes shine with a watery glint, joy and sadness each taking half.

"Cas," Dean whispers. He's too happy and too scared at the same time; he doesn't know what to say. He doesn't forget the other half of the deal. The death part. "I'm sorry," he says. That seems to be the only thing he can come up with.

Cas fondles his cheek, shaking his head. "Don't apologize for bringing me back, Dean."

"I thought I lost you." Tears come back again. "I'm scared, I might have made a really bad decision."

Cas doesn't answer immediately, just pulling him into a hug, patting his back.

"What did Balthazar tell you?" Dean asks, when his breath comes calmer and his chin stops shaking above Cas's shoulder.

"He leaves to prepare for the weapon," Cas says simply.

"The weapon to destroy the city?"

Cas nods. Dean can feel the movement of his cheek against his own.

"I didn't know they'd start this with or without my return. It was already planned. But now, by choosing me and choosing to let the city die, you..." Cas hesitates.

Dean pulls apart for several inches so he can look Cas in the eyes. "I what?"

Cas looks at him, sad. "You're not righteous anymore. They're allowed to destroy the city with you in it. It can happen any minute."

Dean nods with understanding. "He did say 'Everything comes with a price'. I know I can't live with this anyway. Not when it means Sammy has to die too, I'm actually happy they'd let me stay with him until the end."

"Dean --" Cas says softly, pained.

Dean cuts him off. "I don't regret saving you. Ask me again and I would do the same. I don't care it's righteous or not."

"Thank you," Cas says quietly.

They're disturbed by the yelling from the street. Outside, the sunny sky is replaced by a cloud made of fire. Burning fireballs and sulphur start raining down onto the city. The houses start burning. They can already feel the heat stirring the air around them; it's getting thicker and more difficult to breathe.

"You should go now," Dean pushes him.

Cas shifts his eyes from the window to him, the light reflected in his eyes glinting brightly. "The order is to leave you in the city."

"I know, I deserve it." Dean urges him. "But you should go."

"Forget about the order. You always deserve saving, Dean. I can fly you and Sam out of the city," Cas says resolutely, moving over to wake up Sam with a tap on his forehead.

Sam moans as he stands up, and is immediately startled by the falling fire and sulphur outside the window.

"What's happening?" he yells in panic.

"Later," Dean says. "We gotta go. Cas will get us out."

"Just the two of us?" Sam connects the dots fast enough, understanding quickly.

The walls and ceiling of the house moan in the increased temperature, shaking unstably.

"What, you have a dog you want to take with?" Dean snaps.

"Dad." Sam glances at John, then Cas, shifting his feet uneasily. "Please," he pleads, "he's our father."

*He's also the one who killed Cas. He's a sinner.* Dean bites his bottom lip, can't say a word.

He looks at Cas, quietly asking with his eyes. *It's your decision, then.*

Cas thins his lips, but he moves to John's unconscious body nonetheless.

"I'll fly you to the small city of Zoar on the hill. And once you're there, do not look back. Do you understand?" He glances at the brothers.

Dean and Sam give him a nod, and hold Cas's vacant hand.

Dean hears a fluster of wings, and then his feet leave the ground.

But it's a long time, don't have to worry now, go enjoy your boring monkey life, you have a few thousand years to kill."

> Dean to Cas: "Will I ever see you again?" Cas: "You will, I promise." Dean: "But I wouldn't remember you, would I? Everything we went through here, everything I did. I'll forget." Cas (small sad smile): "No, but it's okay." Dean nods sadly, last kiss
>
> Cas is brought to Naomi (enough hint for brainwash)

They can sense the heat of fire and the smell of sulfur from where they stand. Half the sky is burned red and black. Smoke rising high and thick, covering the cloud. They can hear people screaming.

Cas covers the brothers with his wings, protecting their eyes.

"Don't look," he says, low and sad, "Don't look back. There's nothing left for you there."

Dean buries his face on Cas's shoulder, feeling the warmth of full, thick feathers covering his back. He breathes sky.

He closes his eyes, and briefly, he can forget the burning city.

Tears are still falling down.

There are still a thousand lives he can't save, after all.

And what gives them the right to decide, only the three of them get to survive? Including his father, of all the people?

It's not fair.

Dean sobs quietly, feeling Cas's hand stroking his back in small circles.

"It will be okay," he hears the angel promising. "It will be okay."

And for a moment, he believes him.

Cas lets them go, after a while, just standing there with them, their back toward the city. The city is still burning, but they force themselves not to turn and watch.

John wakes up with a moan and picks himself up from the ground.

"What's happening?" he rubs his head, slowly turning.

"Don't look back, dad!" Sam yells.

But it's too late. John already turns to face the burning city, staring with a gaped mouth. His body freezes exactly as he is, and before their shocked eyes, John turns into a pillar of salt.

"Holy!" Sam exclaims, covering his mouth.

Dean just stares, not blinking.

The pillar of salt still holds John's figure, carving out lines on his face, the frown between his eyebrows. But that's all the resemblance. Life leaves him, and Dean just stares, not knowing what that feeling inside his chest should be called.

He doesn't feel grief.

But he also doesn't want to think if it's relief.

So he just stares.

Cas puts a hand on his shoulder gently. "You okay?" he asks.

Dean nods numbly.

"Feeling better?" Balthazar's voice sounds up unexpectedly.

Dean doesn't see him until now.

The angel holds a chunk of salt stone with white blue light in it. He holds it like a weapon.

Dean swallows. "I don't know."

Cas says quietly, "You don't have to do that."

Balthazar points at the sky again. "Order from Upstairs." Then whispers, "Boss's friendly gesture, I think, trying to earn his faith back." He tilts his head to Dean, and Cas follows his eyes. "I don't want to get kicked in the ass again. It's scary. I almost thought I'd get skinned when he knew the righteous man lost faith." Balthazar makes the pretense of a shiver. Cas's lips purse thinner at that.

"What now?" Dean asks slowly, then.

"What do you mean?" Balthazar asks back. "It's over."

"What does it leave me and Sammy? We are all alone in this world now; everyone we knew is dead."

"How's that different from before?" Balthazar quips.

Dean blinks, and Sam hums.

"You're free now," Cas tells them gently. "You can live wherever you want, the way you want. Zoar is a peaceful little town, smaller than Sodom; I think you'll like it."

Dean glances behind them. The town is quiet and indeed very small. It might be good, he thinks. He's not sure he wants to meet many people now.

"Okay," he says.

He takes a step toward Cas, standing before him, looking at the angel. Really looking. The blue in the angel's eyes is not simple monotonous blue, he notices, it's like rings, darker on the outside, lighter near the center. It looks like stars. He stares and studies, wanting to brand the memory in the deepest of his soul.

"Will I ever see you again?" Dean asks quietly.

"Yes," Cas answers promptly. "I promise you will. I will watch over you."

"Even after I die and go to Hell?" He asks, not sad. Accepted.

Cas widens his eyes slightly. "What makes you think you'll go to Hell?"

Dean smiles faintly. "I know how it works. I don't believe anymore, and I have blood in my hands. No way I'd be going to Heaven."

Balthazar clears his throat beside them. "If I may," he raises his hand. The two of them turn to him. "You're not going to Hell," he says.

"See, nothing to worry about," Cas says, relieved. "It's not on you."

"But not to Heaven, either." Balthazar continues.

"Why?" Cas frowns.

"Special guest, special treat, I guess." Balthazar shrugs. "That's usually top secret stuff, but you see, I'm generous to share."

Dean rolls his eyes at "generous", but he doesn't interrupt.

Balthazar tells them, "You will not go into Heaven or Hell, because you will stay on Earth, going into the next reincarnation. It's like a training process. Michael thinks you're not ready yet, just see that mess you just made, but we still have time. We have about four thousand years of time."

"What's in four thousand years?" Cas and Dean ask at the same time.

Balthazar shrugs again, "Some big plan, I hear. But top secret, above my pay grade now, also, spoiler-free. But it's a long time, don't worry about it now. Go enjoy your boring mud life, you have a few thousand years to kill. We'll see you around."

Dean thinks slowly. "I wouldn't remember any of this, would I? In my next reincarnation or whatever. In those four thousand years."

"Clever boy," Balthazar smiles.

Dean looks at Cas, reaching a hand to hold his arms, eyes deeply sad. "Everything we went through here, everything I did. Us. I don't want to forget."

Cas holds him close. "It's okay," he whispers gently. "I will."

They share a long, soft kiss.

It tastes salty and tears, but they continue.

Dean feels the familiar electrical warmth running through his veins. But this time, instead of the energy pulse pushing into Cas, he feels the flow running from Cas, mingling with his, melting inside him.

He hears Balthazar gasp behind them.

"It's not polite to stare," Dean makes an effort to pull apart, speaking as his forehead pressed against Cas's.

"Holy," Balthazar's voice is odd. "How did you do that?"

"Do what?"

"The energy flow between you two, it's like... it's like a profound bond." Balthazar stutters, waving a hand, struggling to find a word.

"I like the sound of it," Dean tells Cas, pecking his lips one more time.

Cas smiles. "I like it, too," he answers.

The two angels watch the two brothers walk into the city of Zoar. Dean stops and looks back and waves at him three times.

For three times, Cas waves back. Until they're out of view.

"Come on, we gotta go, too." Balthazar urges Cas. "You get an appointment."

"From who?"

"Naomi said she wanted to see you," Balthazar informs him.

> (Four Thousand Years later)
>
> 401 timeline (2009.9.18), they meet again in Hell/Pit, both feel familiar, neither remember, but somehow intuitively trust each other already (Cas: "haven't walked earth for two thousand years, haven't met a man like you for four thousand years")

We're here now."

#### Four Thousand Years Later

Dean doesn't remember much about his life between seventeen and twenty-nine. And he tries very, very hard to forget the forty years in Hell, even though he lied to Sam that he doesn't remember a thing.

But he does remember the day the light descends from the sky. Vague shapes with wings surge the Pit, and he laughs at them -- his own voice sounding hysterical and demonic, and he doesn't think he cares.

Until he sees *him*.

Dean doesn't understand what he's seeing, but among all the other lights, there is only one that stands out. He's bright, he's elegant, he's beautiful. And what baffles him most is, he looks familiar.

Dean is sure this is the first time he's ever seen an angel, dead or alive, on Earth or in Hell, let alone having faith in them. But at that moment, when he sees that light, he thinks, he knows him.

That light flies directly to him, when all the others are scattered around, fighting the black smoke.

He stares at those black wings and tries so, so hard to remember where it is that they've met.

The warmth and heat burn him when they touch. But Dean doesn't let go when the light reaches out a hand. He screams in pain with his demon voice, he curses the angels and Heaven alike, but he doesn't let go.

Something deeper than his memory remembers this familiarity, something beyond consciousness tells him to hold on to it. So that's all he does.

The light pulls him out of Hell and brings him onto the Earth.

The light then shapes into a man, hiding his wings. The man introduces himself, "I'm Castiel. Angel of the Lord."

And without knowing why, Dean thinks, he knows he can trust him with his life.

<br>

#### Two Years Later

"You gotta be kidding me," Balthazar yells, when Dean drops the lighter on the holy oil ring.

"I thought you were dead." Cas looks at him and calls him a brother. But he doesn't stop the two boys from threatening to burn his wings extra crispy.

"Come on, we go way back!" Balthazar is more annoyed than frustrated. "You're just letting those flying ass monkeys do this to your brother?"

"I believe the flying monkeys have the floor now," Cas tells him glumly.

Balthazar studies his face, eyes lingering between Cas and Dean, raising his eyebrows. "You've not changed a bit for four thousand years, you know that? I should know you two would always choose each other, no matter how messed up you got."

"What's that supposed to mean?" Dean snaps.

Balthazar shifts his attention back to the brothers. "Nothing," he says, almost joyfully. "Just one little old Balthazar getting a bit nostalgic, remembering some good old time, that's all." He doesn't protest as much when he's asked to put the kid's soul back.

He disappears when Cas distinguishes the holy fire ring, but comes back just in time to turn Raphael's vessel into another pillar of salt.

"You came back," Cas pants, wiping the blood from being beaten up by the archangel.

Balthazar studies the toy in his hand, fondling the salt stone. "Remember this baby? Comes quite handy. You were there, too."

Cas follows his eyes to the weapon, answering slowly. "No, I wasn't there when Sodom was destroyed."

"Right," Balthazar bites his tongue. "Of course, you weren't. You were with Naomi."

*That's probably for the best.* Balthazar thinks.

But his smile still thins. "Anyway," he shoots a quick glance at the Winchesters, then returns to Cas, "glad you guys are here now. I truly do." Then he disappears -- turning himself invisible, to be more precise.

"Is that me or that asshole was trying to hint at something?" Dean turns to Cas with a frown. "I feel like he knew something we don't. Did we forget something?"

Cas frowns and searches his memory. "I don't forget," he wants to say. But then he finds the gaps in his memory. He doesn't remember anything from Sodom, or Egypt, or Noah's time. Balthazar always says he was tasked somewhere else, meeting with Naomi, but he doesn't remember.

"It doesn't matter." Cas shakes his head, deciding. "We're here now."

*Lucky bastards.* Balthazar thinks, watching them. *Good luck this round.* And he flies away.
