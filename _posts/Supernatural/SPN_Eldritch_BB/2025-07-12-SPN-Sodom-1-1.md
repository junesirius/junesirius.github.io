Dean shuts the door, but leaving it unlocked. He lowers the shades, too. The room falls into grey dimness. He lights the candles, placing them in the center of the dining table, shadowing the room with wavering light. There are baked unleavened bread on the desk, ready to serve.

It's not really night yet, outside. The sun is setting, the street in dusk is still busy with the men of the city, young and old. He knows every one of them -- Sodom isn't a big city, everyone knows everyone here. So whenever there is someone from outside comes to the city, all of them know.

The men of the city are heading to the square -- almost all of them, if they are not otherwise occupied. The sound from the street and outside are muffled, with the door and windows closed. But the sound from the square still sneaks in through the cracks -- loud, cheerful voices of men, and an undistinguishable, squeaky, high pitch.

Dean busies himself with cleaning the room, turning against the window.

The voices quiet down eventually. The uproar in the square recedes slowly.

"What's happening out there?" his young brother asks, lifting himself up from the bed, breathing heavily from the effort. He has been resting for the whole day until now, but he still looks pale and tired, coughing now and then. His young body is lean, his footsteps shaky on his way to sitting by the table.

Dean's not sure if it's the noise outside that woke Sam up or the lack of it. He rushes to give him a hand, supporting his weight.

"A newcomer arrived at the city earlier," he says simply, focusing on ensuring Sam sit steadily on the chair, pulling the basket of bread closer for him to reach.

"A merchant?" Sam takes a piece of bread, tearing it from one end, chewing slowly. He grimaces when he swallows, and then continues the next bite.

"An angel," Dean tells him.

"A real angel?" Sam looks up at him, eyes widening.

Dean shrugs slightly. "Don't think anyone would be interested in faking one," he says. "Not the first one in the city, probably not the last one either."

"Why aren't you out there then?" Sam asks, genuinely curious, if not a little confused.

"Why would I?" Dean asks plainly, edging away from their dining table, fidgeting in the kitchen to fill the wine and water bottle, facing away from the door and Sam.

Sam turns in the seat slightly to glance at the back of his brother, "Well, I believe everyone else is, and I bet Dad too."

"You don't know what they're doing to them out there." Dean says glumly, "And I hope you never would."

Sam opens his mouth, just in time for the door opens and their father walks in. His removed jacket hangs on his arms. He leaves it on the rack by the door, heading straight to kitchen to rinse his hands, passing by Dean.

"You look well today," John finishes up, sitting down at the table, checking Sam up.

"I feel better too," Sam nods, then asks, "How's the angel, Dad?"

"So you heard." John flashes a glance at Dean once quickly, "They are peculiar creatures. We did what we enjoy, and now we know him in every sense."

The word *"know"* has many meanings, and Dean knows well enough it's the worst kind in this sentence.

"Which is blasphemous and unmoral." Dean can't help himself snapping, bringing the wine and water bottle over, putting them down on the table with a little too much force. "It's not right."

"I see your brother is still the same, innocent and difficult." John says sourly, still facing Sam. "Morality has nothing to do here, neither is piety. How many times do I need to remind you: when in Sodom, do as Sodoms do. It's nothing wrong when everyone is doing the same."

"It still is," Dean sits down at the table bitterly. "Why can't we move out of this city? It's clearly sinned, I'm sure you can see that."

John shrugs nonchalantly, undisturbed in eating the food. "Sam is not well for travelling. And where do you suggest we go? Gomorrah? Why would we even go farther east when we have a good life here? You should feel lucky to have a place to live in this city, boy."

Dean swallows, lowering his head, defeated. He glances at the direction of the door, thinking of the high pitch he heard. The bread in his throat forms a lump, dry and cold. "Where is that angel now?"

John squints at him, eyes piercing through his skull, as if reading his mind. "Gone," he says decisively. "And don't you dare go get yourself into stupid trouble like interfering when our neighbors are doing what everyone always does around here. Those flying beings from the sky, they're nothing to us. They are no stronger than us, no more powerful than us. They can't get out of the cuffs we forge or the circles we draw, I see no reason to fear or worship or worry about them, you hear me?"

Dean can sense the burning gaze on his skull without looking up. He forces the lump in his throat down in a hard swallow.

Sam's eyes are on him too, waiting.

"Yes, sir." Dean forces himself to answer, voice quiet.

"Good," John nods approvingly.

The dinner continues in peace.

Sam clears his throat, "Is there any other news out there, Dad?"

"Leah gave birth to a boy. Many are surprised." John says absentmindedly.

"Not her husband's, I presume?" Sam asks, voice natural, just slight curious. As if it's the most common thing to witness around here.

"Martin's," John says simply.

"Our neighbor Martin?" Sam chuckles, "He must have, what, at least four kids with four different women now?"

John gives him a look, "Like most of men in the city, yes. He still has desires, like all of us."

Dean tunes out.
