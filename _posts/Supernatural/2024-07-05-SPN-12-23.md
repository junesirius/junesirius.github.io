> Castiel: Kelly. <u>I told you I'd put this together. I'm very good at following instructions.</u> And you need to rest.

> Kelly: No, I don't.

> Castiel: Kelly --

> Castiel helps Kelly to her feet.

> Kelly: No, Cass, I don't. I can't. I don't know how long until... I don't know how long I have left. And I... I'm never gonna be able to teach him how to ride a bike or watch him get married or even look him in the eyes. <u>But I can build him a stupid Swedish crib! I can do that.</u>

> Castiel: Kelly, I know how hard this is. (Kelly gives Cass an incredulous look) That's a lie. I have no idea how hard this is for you. <u>But I promise you... I will do everything. I will give my life for your son. And I will raise him. And I will make him someone you will be proud of.</u>

> Kelly: I know.

> Kelly: I'm just saying, the checkout guy looked at us like we were super weird.

> Castiel: Ah, you'll get used to it.
>
> Kelly: Okay, but... Cass, I mean, you went a little overboard.
>
> Castiel: <u>I disagree. I have read 74 books on child rearing, and there is one thing that they all agree on -- everybody poops.</u>

> Kelly: Well, you're not wrong.

> Crowley: You rang? Hello, boys.
>
> Dean: (punches Crowley and holds the demon knife to his throat) Did you do it? Did you let Lucifer out?!
>
> Crowley: I didn't "let" --
>
> Dean: Don't!
>
> Crowley: <u>Moose, a little help here!</u>
>
> Sam: Dean, wait.
>
> Dean: Seriously?
>
> Mary: Seriously?
>
> Sam: Look, just don't kill him. He worked the Cage spell with Rowena. Maybe he can help us.
>
> Mary: And what if he can't?
>
> Sam: Well, then we kill him.
>
> Crowley: Cage spell? Thought you had mother for that.
>
> Dean: Rowena's dead.
>
> Crowley: <u>Really?</u>
>
> Sam: Yeah, really. Lucifer.
>
> Crowley: <u>Funny. I always thought I'd be the one to kill her.</u>
>
> Sam: Crowley... why did you do it? Save Lucifer -- What did you want?
>
> Crowley: <u>I wanted to win. I perverted mother's spell, put Lucifer in a vessel of my own making because I wanted to win.</u> You have any idea how many people have made a play for my throne over the years? Lucifer, Abaddon, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Too damn many. I thought if I could put the Devil on a leash... my own personal nuke, no one would ever dare challenge me again.
>
> Dean: Yeah. That worked out great.
>
> Crowley: All ended with me narrowly escaping death by hiding in a rat.
>
> Mary: Wait. In an... actual rat?
>
> Crowley: Wasn't too bad, really. <u>Gave me time to think. You know, I've been focused for so long on keeping my job. Never realized I hate it. All those whining demons, the endless moan of damned souls, the paperwork! I mean, who wants that?</u>
>
> Sam: You.
>
> Crowley: Unh-unh. Once, maybe.
>
> Sam: So why are you here?
>
> Crowley: Well, <u>whenever there's a world-ending crisis at hand, I know where to place my bets. It's on you, you big, beautiful, lumbering piles of flannel. So if you'll forgive my transgression, I'll make it worth your while.</u>
>
> Dean: Which means?
>
> Crowley: <u>After we put Lucifer back in his cage -- together -- I'll seal the gates of Hell. You'll never see another demon again, apart from, of course, yours truly.</u>
>
> Mary: You would do that?
>
> Crowley: Why not? They stab me in the back, I'll happily stab them in the front, the sides, and right up their little black-eyed asses. So... we have a deal?

>
> Kelly: "Pressure waves"?
>
> Castiel: <u>It's what they -- it's what they called contractions in my doula class. I-I took it online. First-time mothers, labor can be 12 to 18 hours, sometimes longer. It... Although, given this is the child of Lucifer and a quasi-celestial being...</u>

> Castiel: Kelly.

> Kelly: Tell me again. Tell me again what you saw.
>
> Castiel: Right, I saw -- I saw... (Cass closes his eyes and recalls the events of 12.19, Kelly taking his hand and the golden glow taking over him, his eyes glowing gold) <u>I saw the future. I saw a world without pain or hunger or want. I saw the world that this child... that your child...</u>

> Kelly: Mm.

>
> Kelly: Mm.
>
> Castiel: <u>And it is a world without fear and without suffering and without hate.</u>
>
> Kelly: Mm.

> Castiel: Yes, heavily.
>

> Castiel: I don't... <u>What are you doing here?</u>

> Dean: <u>Saving your ass.</u>

> Sam: You and Kelly just taking off was a stupid move. But there's no way we're letting Lucifer get his hands on that kid. It ain't happening.
>
> Dean: Look, Sam's right, okay? We'll work through our crap. We always do. But right now, we are here to get you, get Kelly, and get gone.

>
> Castiel: I don't know. No, that wasn't me. <u>That was the child. And in case you haven't noticed, he's a little busy.</u>

> Sam: Cass? What is that?
>
> Castiel: <u>It's a tear in space and time.</u>
>
> Dean: Uh, and that means?
>
> Castiel: It's a doorway to another world.
>
> Dean: Anoth -- What, like Narnia?
>
> Castiel: No. No, through there it's Earth, but...but different. <u>It's a -- it's an alternate reality.</u>
>
> Castiel leads Sam and Dean toward the rift.
>
> Sam: So it's a Bizarro world? <u>Or -- or like the place we got zapped to where we were, uh, uh, actors on a TV show.</u>
>
> Dean: Oh, yeah. <u>The supernatural wasn't real.</u>
>
> Sam: Yeah.
>
> Dean: <u>And you were Polish.</u>
>
> Sam: R-right.
>
> Sam: Wait, Cass, how did this get here?
>
> Castiel: Well, <u>the child being born, his power, it seems to be puncturing the fabric of our universe.</u>
>
> Dean: Awesome.
>
> Sam: Yeah. And what exactly is on the other side?
>
> Castiel: You don't wanna know.
>
> Dean: Probably. But we need to.

> Sam: Whoa. Cass, what is this?
>
> Castiel: As I said, it's -- it's Earth. <u>But this Earth is locked in eternal war between Heaven and Hell. There are armies of angels fighting hoards of demons, and the few humans that remain are caught in between.</u>

> Dean: Bobby, it's us. Sam and Dean Winchester.
>
> BOBBY: The only Winchester I ever heard of was John.
>
> Sam: Yeah. John Winchester, our father.
>
> BOBBY: Doubt it. He's dead. Been dead over 40 years now. Only reason I know about him is this Hunter I ran with, Mary Campbell. You get a few pints of shine into her, and she always told the same story about the man she loved -- John Winchester. Azazel killed her about 10 years ago.
>
> Sam: Cass, what the hell is this?
>
> Castiel: <u>This is a world where you were never born. It's a world you never saved.</u>
>
> Sam and Dean look around at the death and destruction.

> BOBBY: When this... whatever opened up, all sorts'a alarms went off back at my place. I got here just in time to see your boy get ambushed by a tempter demon.
>
> Dean: A what?
>
> Castiel: It's, um... black eyes, pointed teeth, horns.
>
> Sam: Wait a second. Demons have horns now?
>
> Dean: Whole new world, Sam.
>
> BOBBY: <u>Usually I gun down flyboys on sight. But, uh, he looked... different. Wasn't wearing a necklace made out of baby ears, for one thing.</u>
>
> Castiel: We got to talking about where I came from and our two worlds.
>
> BOBBY: From what he says, pretty much peaches and cream on your side.
>
> Dean: Oh, I wouldn't say that. It's better than this.
>
> BOBBY: Well, I don't know. <u>Ain't so bad here, if you like killing angels.</u>
>
> Sam: And you do?
>
> BOBBY: <u>It's my hobby and my passion.</u> So...I figured, it's only a matter of time before the dicks upstairs get wind'a this. And when they show... me and Rufus go to work. He's loaded with a hundred rounds, cast from old angel blades.
>
> Dean: <u>Wait, angel-killing bullets? Awesome.</u>
>
> <u>Cass shoots Dean a glare, Dean doesn't consider it quite as awesome.</u>

> Crowley: -- A life.

> Lucifer is flung away from Dean by an invisible force.

> Crowley: Surprise.

> Lucifer: Crowley! (Sam rushes over to help Dean up, and pulls him back toward the rift) You sneaky little... So I guess I get to kill you twice, huh, Crowley?
>
> Crowley: I doubt it.
>
> Lucifer: Oh, no, no. You had your chance. You could've put me back in the Cage, but... you had to make it personal, didn't you?
>
> Sam and Dean stop by the rift and watch Crowley and Lucifer.
>
> Crowley: You're right. It is personal. You humiliated me. I... I hate you. Deeply. Truly. I'm gonna enjoy wiping that smug, self-satisfied look off your face. Personally.
>
> Lucifer: You mean...this one? (Crowley's lets his angel blade drop into his hand) Come on, Crowley. You know whatever you try, you're gonna lose.
>
> Crowley: You're right. <u>(he turns to Sam and Dean) Bye, boys.</u>
>
> <u>Crowley stabs himself with his angel blade, and falls to the ground, dead.</u>
