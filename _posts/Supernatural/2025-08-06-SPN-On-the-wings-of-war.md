god, this is so great, there is no word to describe. the whole plot, the whole story, the whole design, all those characters, everyone so real and vivid and emotional and full of their own thoughts and ideas and motivations. I didn't expect the part with Gabriel, Michael and Lucifer hit me so hard, in the end Michael only wants to save his brother who loved him in return, and Gabriel is still watching the two brothers he love so much having to battle and kill each other, and both of them are separated and in darkness or penance. Gabriel go to the deep space to be with Michael in the end, is both so sad and beautiful, so unfulfilling yet it's all their own choices. I love it so much that Sam would leave sweets on the table and Gabe would come to grab them. to know they are still remembered, still those on Earth remember their sacrifice and care for them, think of them.

sacrifice, so much sacrifices, everyone has sacrificed in this story, Dean, Cas, Sam, Gabe, Michael, even Azrael. totally didn't expect to see Azrael to be like that, playing the part as herself, as an angel with her own wishes and thoughts, not like in most fics as if just a functional character, just a proxy of Death. She's so much more, more real, more vivid, like the rest of everyone

the plot design is so amazing, everything knitting together so neatly, I'm astonished by the story design, especially when Dean was protecting Sam with his wings and he's almost burned, and Sam said let me help, and he just used the leftover angel grace Gabriel left in him. I gasped in the unbelievably masterful design of the plot there. the plot of Gabe possessing Sam makes so much sense now, it's so elegant and delicate

the relationship between Dean and Cas, I have wondered where it would go. they already start off caring so much for each other, willing to die for each other, I wondered what more they can offer each other. and of course Cas had to almost die again for Dean to sacrifice greatly to save him again. I had to check back up to know for sure there is no MCD warning for the story to have enough courage to read on and finish it. I was so scared. those following angsty moments after the world is saved, the feeling of being annexed, wanting but not dare to touch, yearning but at lost, confused at who they are, unsure of the path ahead, all so real, so relatable, too true and they hit so hard. I managed to not cry when they were fighting the war so hard, but those last few chapters, god I cried so hard.

It's such an amazing story. It's a very slow read for me, I think I spent months crawling in the plots, and when it's near the ending, in the last maybe ten chapters, I can't help finishing it in one go. I don't regret a minute I spent reading and crying over the story. It's just brilliant, amazing. Thank you, thank you for writing this amazing story and sharing with us.
