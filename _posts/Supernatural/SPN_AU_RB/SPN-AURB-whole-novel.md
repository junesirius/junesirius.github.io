## Draft

### Prompt

visual: Dean is injured somehow and Cas is trying to heal him or ask him what happened.

Dean is some creature or non-human (or whatever reason his blood veins are showing)

Cas wears glasses and a cross necklace, could be a college student, a priest, a wizard, or whoever may be related to these two details

### Ideas

#### Idea 1: researcher!Cas x magical creature!Dean

(heavy angst, light domestic, potential intimate, ≈ *The Shape of Water*)

Cas is a researcher in a top security government facility where Dean is a new asset they recently captured from Amazon rainforest, known to be worshipped by the locals as their god. Dean is feral and untamed, aggressive, broken and beautiful, his blood veins glowing faintly through translucent skin. Dean doesn't have a name initially, only has an asset index number (DW-124), Cas is the one named him Dean, and he reacts to the name, so it's also used by others (good people) gradually.

Dean is mistreated because of how dangerous he is, constantly punished for attacking those who approach him, electroshocked, beaten a lot. And he gets even worse temper and aggressive after those, a vicious circle. No one wants to approach him and he attacks indistinctively. Except for Cas. Cas treats him kindly, as if he's equal and sentient, teaches him to speak/understand human language. They get close, start understanding each other. Dean is curious and happy every time Cas visits him. Cas is always worried about his safety whenever he's not around and Dean is left with other researchers. So Cas spends more and more time in the lab with him.

The project lead (Naomi? Raphael? Zachariah?) decides to put him down because of the number of accidents he caused to others. Cas overhears the decision, risks himself to steal him out from the facility, hides him in his house, attends to his wounds (bandage his sprained wrist, apply iodophor on scratches), gives him his clothes (jumpers, t-shirts, jackets). They have some domestic moments (though chaotic, quite a few incidents like Dean accidentally breaking things). Dean starts to understand more of human life, able to use human language; Cas gets to understand more of Dean. Whenever Dean's emotional (happy, fear, aroused, etc.), his blood veins lighten up; Cas is fascinated by his breath-taking beauty, worshipping/admiring him like a god (maybe gets intimate in all aspects including sexually?).

Cas is religious (thus the cross necklace), as is many researchers/project lead, but they all think the native Americans worshipping a creature like Dean is blasphemy, all the more reasons to diminish him. Dean asks Cas about that once he learns the meaning of the cross and his belief, why Cas still admires him so much. Cas practically shifts his whole belief and faith to Dean because of how much he sees in Dean, realizing god isn't an ethereal deity, but must be something beautiful and powerful and real, like Dean.

The facility security is persistently searching for Dean, and eventually finds him at Cas's house. And Dean's health is deteriorating because he's too far from his native living place, the source of his life force. Cas is ready to set Dean free; Dean wants him to come with; they have some argument. It's painful for both of them, to make the decision, to know the parting is inevitable and close, but Cas makes the decision for the best of Dean (despite how much it pains him).

They are at the edge of the woods, saying their farewells, looking at each other lovingly, longingly, and painfully, both heartbroken to know this might be the last time they see each other if they part. Cas touches Dean's face, saying farewell and very close to confession (but still restrained himself) with teary eyes; Dean catches his hand, still insisting he can come with.

Cas is hesitating, torn apart; the chasers get into range, shooting them. Cas jumps to protect Dean, gets shot; Dean outrageous, attacks them, putting many down (including the project lead), and gets shot too. They fall down together, Cas uses his last breath to touch Dean's hand and tells him he loves him and dies. Dean desperate, leans in to kiss him, and his blood veins lighten up, more bright than ever -- he's indeed a god-like creature with powers, the native Americans are right about worshipping him. His power gets triggered when he's this desperate and in love and not willing to lose Cas, and he brings Cas back and heals him. They take down all the rest of chasers, and run off to live in the woods together. Cas doesn't hesitate to follow him this time. They'll build a life together in a safe place where they won't be found or harmed, happily ever after.

#### Idea 2: student!Cas x magical creature!Dean

(light angst, light fluff; college life)

Cas is a biology major grad school researching student, his lab specializes on magical creatures, Dean among one of them (there are many others, including like Benny as vampire, Garth as werewolf, background Benny/Garth; many of them can understand at least some human language, Dean included, he's in good friendship with Benny/Garth and other creatures as well). Cas follows his professor (Gabriel?) to observe and study them, working on his thesis.

The lab treats them well, giving them sufficient living space, attending to their needs, all personnel being kind enough to them (all things considered, regarding to basic needs). But Dean is still unhappy, bordering depressed, affecting his health physically. His blood veins show on the skin, and his skin gets more pale and translucent by the day, which is probably a sign of his deteriorating health. But he's the only one of his kind, no one knows what he is, what he needs, how to fix/save him. And when Cas comes to the lab, he decides this is his thesis project -- to understand Dean, to know what he is and what he wants, to make him happy.

Cas spends a lot of time in the lab with Dean; Dean becomes visibly happier every time they meet and the more they meet. Cas does some experiment on him (not biological or clinical, more like psychological questionnaires, game-like, fun activities), gets many new findings about Dean like what's his favorite music, movie, food, etc., things others never think about to learn about and talk about with those "creatures". (Even if they are treated "nicely" by the lab and other researchers, they're never treated as equals, as humans, only as creatures. But Cas does.)

They have deep intellectual conversations. They do a lot of activities that almost look like dates (they are). The more Cas learns about him, the more attracted/fascinated/addicted to him. And progresses well on his research and paper.

(During one of their hang-outs, Dean spots the cross necklace and buys and gives Cas as a gift, because in his culture/memory, it's a protection symbol, a luck charm, and as far as he considers, Cas is like a god to him, has the power to decide his fate as a lab subject basically. Cas is touched but a bit upset about this, saying he's a free man, his fate is his own. Cas takes the gift and wears it ever since. And probably after that Dean moves out of the lab, into Cas's house; a few other sentient non-human species get relocated too, like they find a place for Benny/Garth.)

But his findings and experiments can't be reproduced, when his lab mates (Balthazar? Sammandriel?) do the same, Dean gives different reactions and results. Cas's research results are challenged, he's bottlenecked by can't figure out the root cause.

When Cas has to stay away from Dean for a period of time (maybe like some academic conference, just a few days, at most a week), Dean's condition is deteriorated so terribly, he hurts himself, he's more aggressive and angry and frustrated, he gets into fights and troubles, he runs away a lot, they have to confine him to protect him from himself. When Cas comes back, he's devastated and heartbroken to see Dean like this, touches Dean ever so tenderly, cups his cheeks, and hugs him. And Dean looks almost surprised, saying "You come back". So it turns out the root cause of Dean's issue is serious abandonment issue and his depression is caused by loneliness (especially after seeing Benny/Garth has each other).

They talk it out (using actual words), Cas reassures him he's not abandoning him, giving him enough sense of security, Dean's happy again. Cas finishes his thesis, and the conclusion he writes down eventually is: "The fundamental cure for Dean is love." And he's really glad he figured it out and himself becomes a part of Dean's cure.

The last scene suggests since the research on him is complete, Dean moves out of the lab and moves into Cas's apartment (or maybe previously when Cas is studying him, he uses excuses like "it's easier for research" and so Dean's already sort of moved into his apartment, without either of them realizing they'd already live together, can add a bit domestic scenes during the getting-familiar, getting-together time). Cas will graduate smoothly, and Dean is free. They don't have to decide on what to do with their future yet, because they can have all the possibilities in the future any way they like, and experience them together.

#### Idea 3: human student!Cas x non-human student!Dean

(light angst, light fluff, ≈ *Carnival Row*; has some equality topic, college life)

In a world where non-human species are known to exist but looked down upon and considered unholy by humans. Normal human Cas goes to college, thinking it's just going to be a normal four-year school life. He gets assigned to have roommate Dean, who sometimes acts weird and fidgety but in a lovable way. Cas is in good relationship with him, and doesn't think twice that Dean might be different from him. (They are close, but there always seems to have some tension and uncrossable barrier between them that they can't fully address or be fully together.)

(Cas comes from a religious family that believes pure-blood human is a more superior species than all other human-like but non-human species -- the purist. Cas has doubts about that, but he hasn't met any of other species in his life, only hears about them, so he isn't very vocal about them and knows too much about them. He wears a cross necklace that is a family tradition that shows he shares that belief, just not to get into conflict with his family.)

But Dean is different. He always wears long sleeves, doesn't show his skin in any case, avoids changing under any circumstances, avoids blood tests, covers his face and neck with makeups. (some normal college life, shared dorm life here) Cas has a glimpse of the patterns on his face and neck, but only thinks they're old scars from some traumatic past that Dean wouldn't want to be reminded (and they become more apparent when Dean is emotional). He intuitively knows Dean might be hiding something, but he believes Dean deeply and trusts if it's something serious and if Dean wants to talk about it, he'd wait for Dean to bring it up himself.

But Dean never does. And it's subtle but every time Dean notices his necklace, he averts his attention and has to try to hide his discomfort. Cas doesn't know why yet. Dean briefly subtly asks him about his opinion of other species, asking as if it's a hypothetic question, and Cas tells him he isn't sure. Dean appears upset by his answer, and becomes more down and distant shortly after that. Dean goes to bar.

Cas starts to have suspicion just from that particular conversation, and starts to think over on all the other scenarios and strange things he notices from Dean throughout the course. And maybe because Dean hasn't come back to dorm after way too late, Cas starts to worry, so goes to the same bar to look for him. That's when the accident happens. Dean is a bit drunk and not in a very good mood, he gets into conflict with another student (Crowley?) by the time Cas arrives. The other guy mocks him and/or Cas or said something insulting/triggering, Dean explodes, shouts back tearily "Cas will never love me if he knows who I am", and they get into fight. Dean gets wounded and bloodied, so is the other guy. Dean just lashes onto him all those frustration and tension.

Cas has to pull him away, protects him from the blow. Dean sees him but still too upset to register, maybe think this Cas is just his drunk hallucination, lashes out onto him a bit too, gives him some punches (not severe), Cas just takes it. Cas takes him back to dorm, hurt and upset and asks why he thinks he'd never love him, what he means "who he is". Meanwhile Dean's blood veins are showing more visibly than ever because of all the alcohol and his emotions. Dean still doesn't say, but Cas already has a pretty good idea that he's not human. Dean babbles some rubbishes, maybe unconsciously confesses a bit, continuing the topic of he doesn't think Cas would love him, and then passes out from drunkenness. Cas is sleepless for the night, thinking too much, hurting too much, understanding now.

The next morning, Dean regrets what happened the night before, knowing Cas must know now, scared, defeated, heartbroken, hurt, but forces himself to pretend calm, start packing and ready to move out (expect to be kicked out), not daring to look at Cas, also not bothering to cover his vein patterns now, which is very apparent because he's very very emotional even if he pretends not. Cas stops him, "Where do you think you're going?" Dean: "Out." "Where?" "Anywhere but here." "Look at me." "I don't need the know how you see me now." But Cas cups his face and Dean has to meet Cas's eyes. There is no hate, no disgust, not in any way other purist humans look at non-human species like him would look. Cas looks at him only as Dean, only with love. Cas tells him he's beautiful. Dean is reassured, panic waning slowly.

They talk it out (using actual words), maybe some confession along the way, maybe some kiss (depending on how the talk goes). Cas pulls the necklace down and throws it away, throwing away the hurtful symbol and unfair belief from his family, he chooses Dean.

#### Idea 4: angel!Cas x non-human!Dean

(a lot of fluff, very light angst and mutual pining, fantasy magic school, ≈ *Wednesday*; school life, school romance, getting together, maybe intimate, self discovery)

In a world where magical creatures and species are normal and humans are considered just one of many species, the species that doesn't have special magical powers (which is actually usually considered a disadvantaged species); where there's a magic school to train younglings of all magical species.

Dean gets admitted into that school, but he thinks it must be a mistake, because he's just a normal human being without any special powers. His assigned roommate is angel Cas (an angel, that's why he wears the cross necklace). All other schoolmates are like centaur, witch, wizard, sorcerer, Cthulhu (octopus), phoenix, dragon, siren, ghoul, vampire, werewolf, fairy, angel, demon, zanna, mermaid, kraken, shapeshifter, skinwalker, wraith, nymph, reaper (only show some of these). The school protocol prohibits students from hurting one another, will teach them to control their desire and overcome their weaknesses.

Dean wants to leave the school, but something happened to Cas, like Cas is cornered by some other angel or demon from his childhood (or they might just be some senior bullies before they join, like Lucifer, Raphael, etc.), Dean doesn't have power to fight against them but he instinctively stands out for Cas, bluffs a bit maybe, or unconsciously uses some trick onto those bullies and scares them away. Cas wholeheartedly thanks him, Dean might be on his way to leave the school, and Cas might notice that (like his packed luggage or duffel bag). Cas says a bit sadly that he'd really like to have a friend in this school, it would make his school life so much easier; Dean ends up deciding to stay for Cas.

They start learning magic classes and other necessary knowledge to live safely on Earth among humans, like: flying and teleport, mind control and telepath, spell and anti-spell, divination, ritual, seance, physical combat and defense, human culture, conceal and invisibility, potion, dream walk, magic history, medical and healing, etc. (might only cover a very small subset of those classes, just to add a few humorous scenes)

Dean struggles a lot in most classes because he doesn't have powers, but Cas always helps him out. But some of them Dean does very well just on his own like human-related knowledge. (some scenes of school life and classes here) They get close. The two of them still get into trouble with the bullies consistently. They start preparing pranks to fight them back, and wins small success occasionally. They celebrate them together. They are in closer and closer relationships, but neither of them having the courage to poke the last layer of the window paper.

Meanwhile, all these times, Dean has been having all kinds of vivid dreams, some of them weird, some of them sweet, many of them have Cas in it, just the two of them living all kinds of different lives (all kinds of different AUs, some may be canon compliant or canon divergent). He thinks these are just his own dreams, but occasionally when he indulges himself too much and gets too intimate with Cas in his dream, when he wakes up, Cas looks very blushed and sheepish, maybe even avoids him a little bit. Dean tries to figure out why but can't think of a good reason.

Then he starts to notice the blood vein patterns on his skin, they're extending quickly, making him less human-like by each day. He gets panic, thinking he might get infected with some supernatural diseases from all those other magical species schoolmates. They do research together, Cas reassures him he'll be alright.

They run into the bullies again, mocking Dean being just a normal human, humiliating Cas for hanging out with a normal human, maybe a sign that means he's less than any average angel, so he has to find comfort from species less powerful than him. Dean is furious, can't bear Cas getting insulted like that, explodes with his power, blood veins lighten up with blue lights and drags everyone into a dream world -- he's actually a djinn (previously didn't know because he's not coming to age yet).

This dream world is like the canon world, where Dean is the human hunter and Cas is the angel that saved him. All other people and schoolmates they know are all included in this big dream world that Dean loses self-control to build. Only those who died in that dream world wake up to the real world. The ones in the dream world don't know that, so they just keep living on. The ones getting resurrected after death is because djinn Dean's subconsciousness doesn't want to let them go, let them leave this massive ultimate dream world, so when they die, they don't wake up properly, and djinn Dean's mind just pulls them back in to continue seeing them in that dream world.

But eventually, after Cas sacrifices for him over and over again, in the last time (S15E18), Cas finally confesses, and djinn Dean's subconsciousness finally allows himself to register their feelings and love, and therefore stops pulling Cas back. Cas comes to the magical school world, dazed about all the things they experienced in there, glad that's only a dream world, but also pained for all the feelings they experienced because they all feel very real. He waits for Dean to wake up very patiently, also taking the time to recollect himself, re-register his feelings, attend to Dean's wounds from the bully fight. And then just wait.

And when Dean finally wakes up, they're in their dorm. For a second, Dean still thinks the dream world is real, and then he sees Cas and remembers what's real, and what he really is, what they confessed and realized, and he almost thought he lost Cas for good. So they hug and kiss and confess, Cas cups his cheeks, they stare into each other's eyes long, long time, with too much love, too much feelings, too much emotions. They lose words, so just have to kiss again, feel the solidity of each other's existence again.

Last sentence: "Not that I want to stop, but I really have to prepare for tomorrow's Magical Spell exam now." "I can help."
