Love the interview so much, that blue background suits him so perfectly! The man looks amazing -- well, that's Jensen Ackles, he looks amazing anywhere in any case anyway.

And even better, that interview makes me want to have all those nice little things he's used to having as well -- except when I start looking into the shopping list, I realize they are a tad higher than I'd usually go for. Like, I really thought they didn't look too fancy, but their prices just tend to surprise me, just so low-profile luxury. Damn, that's the moment I got reminded he's a celebrity.

13. Quest cookies and cream protein bar - \$30 ([link](https://www.questnutrition.com/products/cookies-cream-protein-bar))

16. 1967 Chevy Impala pin - cast/staff-only (nowhere), some similar fan-made pins (\$12) on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Enamel-Lapel-Supernatural-Chevy-Impala/dp/B08SHQLJH2)

Though, a little surprised, he didn't mention his car. Really thought a Dean Winchester-encoded Jensen would have mentioned his car being something he couldn't live without. But anyway --

Those things he just listed add up to about \$15000, give or take, that he usually just carries with so casually every day. Talking about quality of life!

Alright, Mr. Ackles, just continue treating yourself with nice quality stuff and continue staying beautiful for us. <3
