> not enough people talk about Bobby and Cas. Bobby was like "ughhh now I have to adopt my adopted son's gay boyfriend" and then he did so with pride

love Bobby Cas relationship so much, headcanon is Bobby is the very first person of all of them to know Dean and Cas are deeply deeply bonded loved needed each other or whatever deepest human emotions can describe them

some most memorable moments: s5 "Are you really gonna bitch to ME?"; s6 "We fighting or running?" then catch a passed-out angel (who decides when he's severely wounded and needs protection, he goes to Bobby) and let him tap his soul; s6 it pains Bobby as much as Dean to think Cas might be working with Crowley; finale he HAS TO specifically tell Dean Cas is ok to let his mind in peace

Sometimes wondered about that finale passing line if it's true, like, I had been thinking maybe Bobby was just trying to make Dean happy and he knows Dean wouldn't be if Cas is not safe, so there is a chance Cas maybe not back but Bobby lied to Dean. But second thought tells me Bobby love (adopted) them both so he would know that would hurt Dean more if he ever learns the truth, so he wouldn't ever lie about Cas to him, so Cas must be really back.

Anyway, somehow that makes the pairing in late seasons Mary/apocalypse world Bobby a lot better to accept. Like, the John she married to was a good kind gentle man, and after she came back (as a 20s), she falls for the same loving gentle man (broken even more version), but still, father figure for the kids (that are 40s).
