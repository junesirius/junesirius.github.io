## Draft

### potential titles

This isn't you (But I still see you)

Almost

You are not him

Look me like he did

Phantom Wings

There is no other way

### Initial idea

天启世界黑卡勒维坦化

在天启世界的正式天启期间那个世界的黑卡接了米迦的指示去打开炼狱，想借用炼狱力量打路西，结果卡把勒维坦都吞了以后自己能量大爆发升级成帝卡，直接把天启打成三方阵营，或者直接一己之力同时炸掉米迦和路西，把整个宇宙变成帝卡宇宙，或者米迦和路西不得不联手来打帝卡，温双进来的时候黑卡正在一打二状态。

米迦/路西：The bitch went crazy.

路西：He's your man, you solve your mess.

米迦：I sent him because of you! If it's not for you fighting so hard --

路西：What? So you're making it my problem now?

（一不小心就会掺一些米路，但是主要还是卡中心）

（卡疯起来就没他俩什么事了）

后面续写下去是丁温和黑卡的slow burn，“我代我自己”的代餐替身文学。黑卡杀了卡，丁要忍着恨慢慢跟黑卡相处，改变他，两个人升温，直到黑卡变成好卡，把原版卡救回来。这时候丁已经不知道自己爱的是哪个卡了，非常confused，非常messed-up。黑卡也非常confused，而且unfair，知道自己一直没得到也不会得到丁的爱，他爱的还是原版主世界卡，只是投射，之前跟丁任何升温都是illusion，所以变好了解决主世界矛盾之后仍然只是一个人，要回自己那个没有丁的世界（hopeful ending? 主卡邀请他留在主世界？）

### Extended ideas and notes

#### world setting

#### Dean

#### Castiel

this is the world without Dean/Sam, this is the world they didn't save, this is the Cas that didn't save Dean so he isn't saved, so now it's Dean's job to save him, hopefully not too late → to prove all Cas can change, and always for Dean

include Dean's widower's curve too, original Cas temporary death

AU Cas's main motivation: killing someone would be easier, breaking them is harder. So he loves torture and breaking them without killing them, wants to rule the world the way he wants it, so can't kill everyone, just enslave them, no free will, basically Nazi + Chuck)

(Castiel is very difficult to love as well, make it difficult, make Dean have to struggle. vice versa)

### Outline



pre-1223 Apocalypse World, Michael orders Castiel to go find Purgatory to get souls to fight Lucifer, Castiel tortures Alphas and finds Purgatory, takes in all the souls and becomes god (with Leviathans in him), turns against Michael/Lucifer, two archangels fight god+Leviathan!Castiel. Castiel could just kill them all and make new ones but think it's less challenging than breaking them, so keep fighting with and torturing them, keep this sick apocalypse war running, even though no one remember what they are fighting for anymore. Michael/Lucifer don't know what to do, and they are so powerless they literally can't do anything right now, only the never-ending apocalypse war, this world becomes even worse than it was. That's when the multiverse portal opens (S12E23)

Dean/Sam/Lucifer/Crowley comes through, see god!Castiel fighting AU!Michael/Lucifer 1v2 at same time and still winning, original!Lucifer senses things seriously off and wants to goes back immediately but already grabbed/controlled by god!Castiel, Dean/Sam sense he's bigger danger, try to hold him off while closing the portal, Crowley self-sacrifice to close portal (=S12E23). god!Castiel get occupied getting off Sam/Dean, portal almost closing, original Cas comes to rescue them, portal closes and traps them all

god!Castiel tortures Dean/Sam try to make them tell him how to reopen the portal, they stay strong; read Dean's mind to know his weakness is Cas, threaten to kill Cas and Dean doesn't give, actually kills original Cas in front of Dean to force him, Cas's wings burned to ground, Dean devastated, break apart, god!Castiel reaches his mind when he's most vulnerable and finds out God-level power has multiverse travel ability (= later Jack & Chuck would), so know now how to travel and opens the portal again, all the while Leviathans are writhing inside him, corrupting him (setting: Heaven/Hell/Purgatory are each universe-separated, Empty has only one among all multiverses)

god!Castiel opens portal, goes through, closes it behind him, Dean mourns his Cas, in his suicidal widower mode and can't care about world right now, Sam terrified, AU!Michael, AU!Lucifer, original!Lucifer very confused. all have no idea what to do, Chuck comes to them asking for help, saying god!Castiel threatens him too, they fight and Chuck loses, now the whole multiverse is in danger of being destroyed by bad god!Castiel. They need to balance the universe and take him out, only one can take down a Castiel is a Dean. and The Dean (from original universe) is the strongest, brightest, has influence over All Castiel (that's why none of other Cas fall for Dean but only this Cas, because only this Dean has that power). Dean asks only thing if Chuck can bring his Cas back, Chuck is drained from fighting god!Castiel, so only way to see his Cas again is to persuade/change/save this dark bad corrupted Nazi god!Castiel to fix it for him, Dean agrees to give it a try

(Dean hates this god!Castiel but still agrees to try to save/change him to make him the way his Cas is like)

Chuck brings Dean to original world (leave everyone else in AU world bc that's probably safer without god!Castiel), god!Castiel lets loose Leviathans onto Earth, Earth is almost S7-like again (or even worse, since these worse things come from more barren universe they thrive here). god!Castiel is in Heaven, waiting for this world's angels' pledge of faith. Dean listens to his speech



###### [TBA: continue outline here]

slow burns suggestions, sketches, not outline:

Dean needs to get over his hatred to this Castiel, need to accept him, show him things he's never felt before

this Castiel is cold, cruel, fascist, only thing he knows is follow order and torture, know how to bring pain, how to break people, worse than avg demon, now a corrupted God, wants to rule the multiverse where everyone obey him, no free will. those disobey, he torture to break them, he get everything done through torture

this Castiel never met Dean, only seen endless apocalypse war, lack love, lack faith, despise humanity

Dean approach this Castiel, first need to overcome his own nauseousness of remembering his Cas's burned wings, resist the temptation of wanting to kill him to revenge (Castiel: "You can't even bare looking at me, I admire your vain courage of the mud monkeys")

Castiel sometimes purposefully provokes him to see his reaction, reminds him he killed his Cas, Dean fights back his own nauseousness very hard.

the beginning: Dean overcomes his hatred, fear, even when Castiel looks like he's killing Dean, tormenting him, want to break him again, Dean bear it all as his resistance (his only weakness is Cas and Cas is already gone so nothing can break him like that again, not even his own permanent death), Dean doesn't fight back, Castiel can't find any way to break him, torture doesn't work like it used to, Castiel resign, stop attacking torturing Dean. Dean laughs, starts talking about his 40y in Hell, how resembled they actually are, Dean talk about his own torturing past as self-disgust, self-hatred, but use it as weapon to make Castiel relate

Dean is also a work-in-progress, still has anger-control issues, especially when he's confused, afraid, he lashes out, he triggers fight, he looks for fighting and wants to be hurt and punished. (Dean is bitter, Castiel is cold and cruel, neither trusts the other, all hostility, discomfort) Dean would try to irritate this Castiel on purpose by saying good things about his Cas that they both know he wouldn't say or do to this Castiel, make both angry, try to make Castiel guilty (which he doesn't, initially), then fight.

slow proximity: something for some mutual goal, some curse, or apocalypse, or something about world-saving, Dean treat him like a person not a soldier to order, Castiel feels seen and uneasy but ultimately values it. Dean starts calling him "Cas" even when this Castiel says not to and Dean himself feels nauseous too feeling betraying his Cas (or just start with calling that accidentally, later on purpose to train himself to get used to it, both making effort). It's improving their relationship slightly. Dean talks to him, brings him food, sleeps near him, bleeds next to him, helps him something small. This Castiel never had that. He lingers but hate himself for that, so resist, and battle back harder, making their relationship even worse and awkward and cold. This Castiel purposefully continue do bad and cruel or even worse things, just to test Dean's reaction. Dean keeps trying.

at some point, this Castiel shows a moment of humanity and Dean softens slightly, both hate that moment for themselves, doesn't admit, pretend doesn't happen and move on. but it happens more often. something like maybe someone saves someone, Castiel doesn't something small but unmistakably good and something the old him wouldn't do

sometimes Dean is happy to see the changes, other times also hate it. The more Castiel turns to Cas, Dean gets more angry, fear, confused. maybe after Castiel accidentally uses some small habit action Cas used to have, or some phrases that feel too familiar. It ruins him, Dean lashes out harder, beats him, fight him, want to kill him again, maybe break down crying while fighting/killing him. Disguised grief surfacing and spilling over everywhere again. He wants him change but also doesn't want. ("You don't get to become him. You are not him.")

after the lash out and fight, maybe some more cold wars, keeping distance but still keep an eye. both conflicted, disturbed, unsure, scared, maybe Dean more so. ("Tell me about him" "He was funny, dorky, sarcastic, bitchy. He loved me. And he died because of *you*.") very easily turn bitter again.

show him the world he never had, the world that could have been (if only Dean's alive in the world): Dean take him somewhere simple and quiet, some place this Castiel would have burned without thought but now Dean asks him to take it slowly and enjoy. Dean do something absurdly human: fix up a jukebox, cook something, sit under stars and tell stories about his Cas. This Castiel doesn't care at first, resist and snort and destroy, but Dean doesn't care either, he has nothing to lose, he lives in his memory. He tries his best, he still sees his Cas through this Castiel, and this Castiel knows and he resents it. the cold point between them that they'll have to figure out. Dean misses his Cas so much, this Castiel at some point start feeling slight guilty about something he did which never happened before.

at some point, god!Castiel magics his wounded eye healed, dead white turn blue again

some deep conversation, triggered by some dream/nightmare sequence maybe: Dean confess his pining/grief for his Cas, talking about old memories with his Cas, Cas has said loved him but never reciprocated, not knowing how until lost him, not begging for this Castiel to bring him back (he could but he still wouldn't, he even more unwilling than before for his selfishness to own Dean as his), but start very slowly seeing this Castiel (he's slightly easier to look at now). It still hurts to look at Castiel, but he's here anyway. This Castiel starts showing possessiveness, he never has anything of his own, now he still can't have Dean, he hates and feels jealous of Dean's Cas, he wants to claim Dean. something get nasty along the line here, maybe non-con or very close to or dub-con, Dean cries, tempted and also self-hatred, unsure, confused. This Castiel feels even worse, feels deeply he's evil, bad, not worthy, self-hatred. some icy point in their relationship around here, but fundamentally some breakthrough. This Castiel starts seeing himself, reflecting on his behaviors and past, and options, he starts think. ("You're not him. But I still see you.")

this Castiel also curious about how the original Cas even begin falling in love with this Dean, and start to see it

some decision point and choices, some dilemma or choice situations to let this Castiel decides what kinds of person/angel/god he wants to be, cruel evil bad unloved kind or changed, some scenarios like he can kill an innocent or walk away or save them, he can betray Dean or protect him, take power or take a chance at connection. (Dean: "It's your choice, but for what's worth, I think you deserve better than what the world made you.") something around here makes Castiel starts questioning himself, starting to redefine what he believes and has faith and wants to do and be again

(at some point, they would each have their first small smile)

(at some point, this Castiel will risk his life saving Dean again, that's when Dean know the change is done and love is there. but it's too messed-up between them, he doesn't let himself love this Castiel, for fear it's betrayal, but also doesn't know if he is not Cas, who is him. It's not fair to him as well.)

(maybe that's also when this Castiel loses god power, or maybe earlier)

(as some point, Dean would save this Castiel's life too. Not entirely forgive him for his past, but enough to save his life. "I don't forgive you for what you did, what you took from me. But I'm not going to lose you again.")

start getting closer, almost like friends but still not quite there yet, can have some life-death battle together, has to trust each other with their lives and they instinctively or choose to trust for them, first time try to put faith on each other and doesn't disappoint, it feels good, feels supported, feels seen. but ultimately Dean still wouldn't really forgive this Castiel for him killed his Cas, so there is some moment of warmth and full-heart, but there's also still coldness on the edge, Dean goes back to turn to himself, still giving those moments and his whole heart only to his Cas. this Castiel finally can't take it anymore and makes the decision, changed from where he started, becomes god of mercy and start caring of the world, and caring for Dean's sorrow overruns his own selfishness of possessiveness so he brings Dean's Cas back from Empty. Dean and his Cas reunite in tears, this Castiel leaves quietly alone, saying his loneliness is the punishment he deserves, he can continue rule the multiverse alongside Chuck, having a work shift or ruling the world or change some rules. this Castiel fix leviathan problem and all other problems on the original universe and resume the AU world and save those who can still be saved. Leaves alone and hope for finding someone else love him like Dean loves his Cas, sad smile, doesn't think it's possible, but looking at them, there might still be some hopeful.

(go back to a world without you. A world you were never born.)

(Castiel: "Would you have loved me, if I were him?" "I love him, that's all I can say." "He would be me if he were there, in my world. If he never met you, he's me. And I'm right here." *Please see me, Dean.* "Then yes. The answer is yes.")

why this Castiel need Dean's help: vessel explosion with too much energy, and Leviathan problem like 701

(some dark twist: bad Cas wants to make Dean his own, "I can make you forget him, think I'm him" "Then why didn't you?")
