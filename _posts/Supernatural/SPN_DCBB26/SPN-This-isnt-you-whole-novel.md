## Draft

### potential titles

This isn't you (But I still see you)

Almost

You are not him

Look me like he did

Phantom Wings

There is no other way

### Initial idea

天启世界黑卡勒维坦化

在天启世界的正式天启期间那个世界的黑卡接了米迦的指示去打开炼狱，想借用炼狱力量打路西，结果卡把勒维坦都吞了以后自己能量大爆发升级成帝卡，直接把天启打成三方阵营，或者直接一己之力同时炸掉米迦和路西，把整个宇宙变成帝卡宇宙，或者米迦和路西不得不联手来打帝卡，温双进来的时候黑卡正在一打二状态。

米迦/路西：The bitch went crazy.

路西：He's your man, you solve your mess.

米迦：I sent him because of you! If it's not for you fighting so hard --

路西：What? So you're making it my problem now?

（一不小心就会掺一些米路，但是主要还是卡中心）

（卡疯起来就没他俩什么事了）

后面续写下去是丁温和黑卡的slow burn，“我代我自己”的代餐替身文学。黑卡杀了卡，丁要忍着恨慢慢跟黑卡相处，改变他，两个人升温，直到黑卡变成好卡，把原版卡救回来。这时候丁已经不知道自己爱的是哪个卡了，非常confused，非常messed-up。黑卡也非常confused，而且unfair，知道自己一直没得到也不会得到丁的爱，他爱的还是原版主世界卡，只是投射，之前跟丁任何升温都是illusion，所以变好了解决主世界矛盾之后仍然只是一个人，要回自己那个没有丁的世界（hopeful ending? 主卡邀请他留在主世界？）

### Extended ideas and notes

#### world setting

#### Dean

#### Castiel

this is the world without Dean/Sam, this is the world they didn't save, this is the Cas that didn't save Dean so he isn't saved, so now it's Dean's job to save him, hopefully not too late → to prove all Cas can change, and always for Dean

include Dean's widower's curve too, original Cas temporary death

AU Cas's main motivation: killing someone would be easier, breaking them is harder. So he loves torture and breaking them without killing them, wants to rule the world the way he wants it, so can't kill everyone, just enslave them, no free will, basically Nazi + Chuck)

(Castiel is very difficult to love as well, make it difficult, make Dean have to struggle. vice versa)

### Outline

pre-1223 Apocalypse World, Michael orders Castiel to go find Purgatory to get souls to fight Lucifer, Castiel tortures Alphas and finds Purgatory, takes in all the souls and becomes god (with Leviathans in him), turns against Michael/Lucifer, two archangels fight god+Leviathan!Castiel. Castiel could just kill them all and make new ones but think it's less challenging than breaking them, so keep fighting with and torturing them, keep this sick apocalypse war running, even though no one remember what they are fighting for anymore. Michael/Lucifer don't know what to do, and they are so powerless they literally can't do anything right now, only the never-ending apocalypse war, this world becomes even worse than it was. That's when the multiverse portal opens (S12E23)

Dean/Sam/Lucifer/Crowley comes through, see god!Castiel fighting AU!Michael/Lucifer 1v2 at same time and still winning, original!Lucifer senses things seriously off and wants to goes back immediately but already grabbed/controlled by god!Castiel, Dean/Sam sense he's bigger danger, try to hold him off while closing the portal, Crowley self-sacrifice to close portal (=S12E23). god!Castiel get occupied getting off Sam/Dean, portal almost closing, original Cas comes to rescue them, portal closes and traps them all

god!Castiel tortures Dean/Sam try to make them tell him how to reopen the portal, they stay strong; read Dean's mind to know his weakness is Cas, threaten to kill Cas and Dean doesn't give, actually kills original Cas in front of Dean to force him, Cas's wings burned to ground, Dean devastated, break apart, god!Castiel reaches his mind when he's most vulnerable and finds out God-level power has multiverse travel ability (= later Jack & Chuck would), so know now how to travel and opens the portal again, all the while Leviathans are writhing inside him, corrupting him (setting: Heaven/Hell/Purgatory are each universe-separated, Empty has only one among all multiverses)

god!Castiel opens portal, goes through, closes it behind him, Dean mourns his Cas, in his suicidal widower mode and can't care about world right now, Sam terrified, AU!Michael, AU!Lucifer, original!Lucifer very confused. all have no idea what to do, Chuck comes to them asking for help, saying god!Castiel threatens him too, they fight and Chuck loses, now the whole multiverse is in danger of being destroyed by bad god!Castiel. They need to balance the universe and take him out, only one can take down a Castiel is a Dean. and The Dean (from original universe) is the strongest, brightest, has influence over All Castiel (that's why none of other Cas fall for Dean but only this Cas, because only this Dean has that power). Dean asks only thing if Chuck can bring his Cas back, Chuck is drained from fighting god!Castiel, so only way to see his Cas again is to persuade/change/save this dark bad corrupted Nazi god!Castiel to fix it for him, Dean agrees to give it a try

(Dean hates this god!Castiel but still agrees to try to save/change him to make him the way his Cas is like)

Chuck brings Dean to original world (leave everyone else in AU world bc that's probably safer without god!Castiel), god!Castiel lets loose Leviathans onto Earth, Earth is almost S7-like again (or even worse, since these worse things come from more barren universe they thrive here). god!Castiel is in Heaven, waiting for this world's angels' pledge of faith. Dean listens to his speech
