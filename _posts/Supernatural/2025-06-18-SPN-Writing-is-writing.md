Funny enough, it's so true that spn always seems to have everything one would need. Like, right about now, I could use something motivational for writer's block (procrastinating awfully now), and this is what's been replaying in a loop in my head, rent-free:

> Chuck: It's just-- things are different now. I used to be able to see them in my head, wherever they were, whatever they were doing-- it was all just there, ripe for the plucking. And now it's gone.
>
> Becky: Then write about something else.
>
> Chuck: But-- they're it. They're my favorite story--
>
> Becky: Then write about them.

> Chuck: I... think we're going in circles now--

> Becky: No-- you're going in circles. You're a writer-- a writer who's not writing. And when a writer's not writing, they-- get sad, and they get lost, and the writer asks themselves: "why do I feel this way, why am I so sad and lost?" And what is all that navel-gazing and hair-pulling really about, in the end? It's procrastination, distraction-- just one of a million ways the writer avoids doing the one and only thing that is all but guaranteed to make the writer feel better. Which is--

> Chuck: Well, fanfic, it's not exactly the same-- (thing)

> Becky: Writing's writing. The self-sabotage, the doubts, the struggle against time. Having kids-- it felt impossible that I'd be able to keep going. But it also taught me-- between my online shop and my family, I did not have time to... putz around. So whenever I have a spare minute-- I write.

"Writing's writing." Fanfics too.

"The only way to feel better is just-- you write."

That's some really genuine writers' talk there. And honestly, so much more powerful and sticky to the brain than I thought it would.

Now I'm going to continue messing around with my characters in my worlds.
