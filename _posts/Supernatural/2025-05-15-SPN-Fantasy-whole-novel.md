### Organize

#### Reference

- glass development timeline:
  - 1.5k BC, Mesopotamia/Egypt, the earliest blue glass (4k years ago prehistory)
  - 1AD, Roman, glass window
  - 8AD, Venice, colored glass window
- colored glass architecture development timeline:
  - Gothic 12-16th
  - Baroque art 17th
  - Gothic renaissance 18-20th

#### What is the colored glass/What is color

- **each color is a thought** (Cas's mind is made of colors)
- blue: **color of Cas's real form, Cas transform/born from the blue color**
- glass color as the memory note, bearer of the memory, used for self remind/catch up
- **it's a letter and a promise to keep, each blue line is a time when Cas reincarnate and the used up life force and memory are saved on the glass, already happened 13 times since 4k years ago, 300 years=1 line, Dean wait and guard for 4k years**
- blue is Dean's notes because when he ages he would forget, he uses it to remind himself of Cas's each life
- it's a curse or just how their life forms are supposed to be, **they shouldn't have been able to sustain this long but they use the glass to preserve them, the initial glass before any blue is added is their combined art work, they know each other from that age and already become really good and close but Cas would age Dean wouldn't**, (reverse of canon, a bit like Aziraphale/Crowley + Amy/Rory 2k y centurion)

#### What is Dean/Cas

- Cas is ice/wind/sky/comet, Dean is earth/rock/wolf/oak tree, both forget their true form, know they're not human but forget what they are

#### Cas/Dean development timeline

- both long life creature, **living along the history, protect glass, glass is the big secret, treasure, hidden secret and treasure from prehistory in plain sight, turns out to be a language, a love letter from prehistory**
