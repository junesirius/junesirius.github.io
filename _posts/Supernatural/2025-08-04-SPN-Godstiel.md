can't stop thinking about Godstiel again tonight

When he declares he's the new god and asks them to "bow down and profess their *love*", Bobby is the first to get on his knees, and Cas just stands there watching him kneel without any facial emotions. So then Bobby urges Dean and Sam to kneel, too, and maybe even do the whole "forehead to the carpet" bow to please him.

And **when Dean starts to kneel**, not even reaching the floor, **Cas tells him to stop**. And he says it has no point. He says it's not out of *love*.

<br>

Even when Cas turns "bad", when probably the majority of his mind is taken over by the god power and Leviathans, there is still a tiny little instinctive soft spot in him that just can't bear to see Dean kneel to him. (The next time Dean kneels before him is when he's under Naomi's control and Dean's begging breaks him out of control.)

No one can put Dean on his knees to beg, and he doesn't do it for anyone but Cas. Cas can't bear that, can't resist that, can't *not* fight against any control on him just to make his way to Dean, to be with him in his true self.

I think, if Dean knelt there, begged, Cas might be able to take back control sooner, returning to sanity sooner. Maybe even right there in that room, before flying off to kill all those other angels that become the root of his self-hatred for all the years after this. The whole self-hatred, self-punishment thing in him in all the later seasons is going to be released so much, if they could just stop him there.

<br>

And, just want to say, Cas you idiot, you frighten them with your god power and ask them to "profess their love" to you, and you know that's not love when they start kneeling, how can you not know you have Dean's love already, and you don't even need to ask for it.

Aaaand, it's sort of funny to see how, when Cas first appeared as an angel, all powerful and frightening, Bobby's the first one to start attacking him with an iron crowbar from the back (and got put to sleep immediately). And now Cas appears as a god, also all powerful and frightening, Bobby's the first one to kneel down. Well, what's the matter, Bobby? Why suddenly so obedient? Learned your lesson from the first time?
