I wonder if anyone asked jenmish questions about The Last of Us. Especially that poster on Ellie's wall, if that's really them. Their letters in the game, if they had any say about the contents. Their comments on the beautiful lesbian love in season 2. Or just any imaginative scenarios, asking how they'd imagine themselves in a zombie world like that, what would they do, how'd they survive, etc.

that would be a really fun topic to listen to them talking about in one of those panels

PS: S04E10 Dean picks up a crowbar to beat Alastair off Cas, he saves Cas when their original plan was to let Heaven and Hell tear each other apart. That could have been the scene that Cas is  Is that scripted or improvised?
