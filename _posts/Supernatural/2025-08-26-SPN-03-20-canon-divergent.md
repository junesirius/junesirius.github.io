(S03E11 "Mystery Point" Canon Divergent)

(Inspired by [Original Post](https://www.tumblr.com/junesirius/792977979806515200), and "So Says the Sword")

> So I spent the last few days thinking about the sweet au where Dean goes to heaven during the endless Tuesday, but!
>
> <br>
>
> Somewhere around the third time, everyone got tired of his constant trips back and forth (stop wasting the energy of heaven to create a personalized paradise for the day! consume responsibly!), so they gave him a small piece, as if they sent him to the quarantine zone before the "real" heaven lol
>
> And Cas meets him there. Why Cas? Well, he was free at the time, patient enough to explain what's going on every time (and he can restrain Dean if he has a fit of aggression). Time in heaven is different than on earth, so each death = 1 full day in heaven.
>
> So yes! This little au where Dean spends almost a third of the year with Cas. ofc, he doesn't remember this, bc every time he gets his memories erased. But this angel (a couple of weeks later) looks genuinely friendly, as if he's meeting his best friend. Not that Dean trusts him completely, but did the dude really explain the same thing to him a hundred times? Wow, he really has angelic patience. ("Did I try to kill you once?" "Of course, Dean" "Huh. I guess it wasn't successful.")
>
> Cas tells him that Dean is really amazing. Bc against all odds, every day Dean offers something new. Well, it's still a part of heaven and it changes to suit your desires. They fished, watched movies, shot at cans, cooked, looked at the stars, listened to music etc etc. A little vacation in bad times. Ofc, there were also bad times, with fights, silence, or trying to run away shit like this.
>
> The worst is when Dean doesn't come. On days like this, Cas prays that the loop doesn't break at that exact moment. Dean is too free for Heaven, but he doesn't deserve to wander around as a ghost.
>
> One day, they say goodbye, but there is no wipe. They spend another day together (Dean tries to pretend that he isn't afraid), and then Dean is finally released to his own personal heaven. Just before he leaves the room (where he was told he had spent more than 100 days. wild), he turns around and told Cas to come visit sometimes. Dean feels a strange affection for this stranger, whether something in him remembers the time they spent together or is bribed by the angel's sincere sympathy. Not often, but Cas does come. In the end, Dean returns to earth (ofc without memories), and Cas hopes that they will meet again.

> BUT do you understand what the problem is??? At the very beginning, my brain missed the point that this whole episode was happening because Dean was going to hell. UGH. It doesn't matter if he went to the doorstep of hell, or hung out with the reapers, or played cards with Gabriel, or it never happened because it's an archangel's pocket space - Either way, no heaven for Dean. Ughhhh I'm so annoyed.

The Groundhog Day is not just Sam remembering and having to keep repeating the same things to Dean, it's the same with Cas when they meet again and again in Heaven.

It might make it even more painful, knowing it's the year before Dean's demon deal is due, and *Dean*, is the one remembering the fact, so he always believed, instead of a pocket dimension of Heaven, it's Hell's illusion, it's Crowley's trick, so he distrusts Cas, believes he's a demon disguised as angel to lower his guard, that harm would come his way any time when he's too relaxed. But it never does. It really is (part of) Heaven, and Cas really is an angel.

Every time Cas shows him patience and kindness. Over time, Dean's attitude shifts bit by bit, from hostile in the very beginning, to minor distrust, to gradually slightly trust him a little bit, to eventually trust him intuitively ultimately even without himself knowing why. Later times, he may not have the memory, but his subconscious already recognizes Cas and the sense of security around him. And Dean Winchester, as a good hunter, knows to trust his gut.

So they spend good quality time together; there are good days and bad days. Dean is still confused as to why he ends up in Heaven, instead of Hell; he worries if that means he escaped the deal, Sam might be harmed. He tells Cas about his demon deal, thinking he *deserves* to go to Hell, asking Cas to look after Sam for him, to check on him on his behalf. Cas is upset by that, promising him he'd go investigating a bit. And that's how Cas figures out Gabriel being the Trickster and confronts him about why he torments them so much, demanding him release the brothers.

Gabriel looks at him in the eyes, almost innocently: "Why, Castiel? Would you rather have him go to Hell?"

(So it turns out the little Heaven pocket dimension is all Gabe's arrangement. Just to keep him there. Having Cas there for Dean is also part of Gabe's plan to stop Dean messing around. Just settled down long enough (though still temporarily) when Gabe deals with/having too much fun torturing Sam.)

Cas is speechless, so pained that he can't answer. He doesn't have a good solution to the situation, and he fears that if he tells Dean the truth, Dean might confront Gabriel and end up really in Hell. He goes back to Dean in the pocket Heaven, just pretending he doesn't have the answer, they'll keep living day by day the same as before.

But even Dean notices Cas is different after that, he's more upset, more absent when they're doing their little usual activities like watching TV, more fidgety when Dean asks if he knows anything. He looks guilty and ashamed of himself all the time. Dean can tell when people are lying and he knows Cas must be hiding something from him and he doesn't like it. The distrust between them restarts. Dean thinks maybe he's right all along, maybe Cas is still a demon like he initially believed after all and Cas is worried about him finding out. They might have some big argument, which just upset Cas even more. Both of them are so hurt.

And then maybe Dean finds out the truth somehow, or maybe like in the canon episode, it's the last day of the Groundhog Day loop because Sam finds out about Gabe and corners him. Gabe agrees to back off. (Dean and Cas don't know that's the last day, so the last they see each other, they're still fighting/having a pissed cold war.)

The next day, it's Wednesday, and Dean dies on that Wednesday. For six months after that, Sam is hunting down Gabriel on Earth, and this time, Gabe is a bit too pissed to care anymore and decides to hand off and just lets them be. So these six months, Dean is in Hell, as the deal demands him to be.

Cas believes it's over, it's the new reality and Dean is really dead; it shouldn't be his concern and definitely not his task now. His previous order was just to explain to the newcomers about Heaven, and he shouldn't care about what happened to Dean's soul. But he does, he does so much, so he goes looking for Dean. Cas goes to Hell.

Six months on Earth is sixty years in Hell. And Cas is fighting alone without his garrison. He's wounded terribly, he thinks he's not going to find Dean again, or he'd be too late for him. But he's still too desperate to give up, and eventually he finds him in the deepest Pit torturing souls. Cas saves him and raises him from Hell, at the end of the sixth months, about the same time Sam finds Gabe.

Cas is healing his body and soul, rebuilding Dean, wiping his memory of Hell because he knows how much it must pain him. The whole process takes great effort, especially considering how wounded himself is and how weak his grace is from the mission, Cas does everything he thinks is the best for Dean, based on when he learned about him during their time together. But he also thinks remembering him would make Dean question about the blank period in Hell, so he wipes himself from Dean's memory as well.

During this time, Sam is confronting Gabriel. Gabriel finally agrees to put things back in order for them, thinking instead of warping the whole reality, he'd just wipe all their memories so it's as if nothing has happened. He searches Hell for Dean, and he realizes Dean isn't there. Neither is him in Heaven. Gabe is panicked a little bit, thinking how come he lost the Michael Sword completely. That's when Dean comes home by himself, saying hello to Sam, not remembering a single thing since "the previous Tuesday". Sam is relieved, thinking Gabe keeps his promise and things are returned to normal. So they keep moving on as the rest of canon season 3 does.

Meanwhile, Gabriel finds the wounded Castiel at the place where he healed and rebuilt Dean, and is quitely impressed and surprised by what he did, and also knows he wiped himself from Dean's memory.

Gabe: Why did you do that?

Cas: I don't believe it's a good idea. He doesn't need to know angels are real. He doesn't need me. (Because Cas still believes Dean is mad at him because of the fight they had on their last day, it pains him, but Cas believes they didn't part as friends, he's only a painful burden for Dean, that's why.)

Gabe: (raise his eyebrows) I assure you, brother, that's not true.

And then S3 finale happens, Dean goes to Hell for real, again. And angels receive the order to retrieve the Righteous Man, and Cas volunteers to fight in the front. He says he's been there and is familiar with Hell and the way demons fight, because of the first round. He will be punished for violating some Heaven protocol to secretly going down there last time without management approval but Cas doesn't care, as long as they let him lead the rescue mission. And they (Michael, Naomi, Zachariah) agree.

Cas goes to Hell to save Dean, again. And with the previous knowledge and the garrison by his side, this round is faster and slightly easier, but it still takes them four months to reach the Pit. And because Hell also recognizes their defense weakness from Cas's previous rescue, they strengthen the defense specifically against Cas, so it's even more difficult and dangerous for Cas. He's more wounded, he loses more grace, his wings are torn, but he goes down to the Pit alone and first for Dean anyway, protects his soul in his wings' wrap, saves him, restores him, rebuilds him. Then he just leaves him under the earth, watching him climb out. Only then does Cas care to attend to some of his own wounds.

And then, can't help himself, knowing Dean has heard him talk so many times when they were both in Heaven, Cas automatically thinks Dean can hear his true voice. So he speaks to Dean, a little over-excited, in his true voice: "Hello, Dean."

But he's pained to realize he's wrong, Dean can't hear him now, and then the barn is the first time they get to meet each other again. Dean throbs a blade on his chest, exactly like the first time they met in Heaven's pocket dimension when Dean believed he was a demon. This time, Dean too had a hard time believing he's an angel. But it's okay for Cas, for he knows all it takes is the time and patience and be there when Dean needs him. It's a second chance for them, almost like.

That's exactly what Cas does in the following twelve years. (Some time in between, Dean's subconscious kicks in again and Dean quickly (quicker than usual) chooses to trust and hav)

In those twelve years, sometime after they are close enough and can comfortably just sit together and watch TV together, Cas is reminded of those times they spent together in Heaven, he'd have that small smile on tip of his lips. And Dean just thinks he's happy, and he's happy his angel is happy too.

And sometimes Cas shows he knows more about Dean then Dean knows, little details like his habit in fishing. Dean's always surprised to notice it and note it out for Cas, tries a few times asking Cas how he knows. And Cas just smiles a little and stays quiet. He might tell him one day. But for now, they have each other, they're both happy about each other's company. Everything on Earth is just like Heaven, it's good enough for now.
