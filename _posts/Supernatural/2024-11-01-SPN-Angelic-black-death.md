### Chapter 1: Here We Go, Again

#### Act 1

They're celebrating. Just the three of them in the bunker's kitchen, Sam, Dean, and Cass, with several dozens of beer and a full table of (now almost empty) pizza boxes. But nevertheless, it's a big celebration.

"Finally, finally!" Dean is saying, over a bottle of beer, can't stop beaming, "A big win long overdue, here we go!"

"Yeah I hear you." Sam agrees, a little over himself too, lazily leaning into the seat by the wall, sipping his share of beer. "No God, no Darkness, no angel or demon, no new freaking Apocalypse, no bigger disaster when the old one is barely missed. How long have we ever really get this much peace?"

Cass seriously considers his question. "At least eleven years ago." He answers, with a straight face.

Dean looks up from his bottle, beaming brighter, "Good to have you back, Cass."

Castiel meets his eyes and nods, "So are you, Dean. I'm very glad you're okay."

Dean studies his face, and Cass holds his stare -- actually, from where Sam is, it looks like they are just both silently researching each other, microscoping and dissecting, looking for tiniest trace of something ominous hidden beneath the surface, looking at something they haven't seen in a long while, as if they didn't pretty much spend every second of the last couple hours together.

"How are you really, Cass?" Dean breaks first, voice soft. Judging by how Cass parts his lips and pauses, he is beaten by a millisecond by the very same question he was just about to ask Dean.

"I'm fine." Cass answers without really thinking, but his smile drops a tiny little, the voice mingled in a very quiet sigh. He shifts his eyes, turns to take a deep drink of whatever liquor that was sitting in the glass in front of him.

"No post-Devil-possession syndrome?" Dean chases his eyes, "Just, you know, when have things ever been easy for us? I'm just thinking loud, in case there is anything, we might want to give the celebration a rain check."

Cass stares back with slightly widened eyes, "No, there is no such syndrome, and I feel fine."

With that, he narrows his eyes and throws the question back, "What about you? No 'post-Darkness-entanglement-and-soul-bomb' syndrome?"

His fingers did an air quote and Dean finds his eyes automatically get distracted and dropped on his fingers, flickering with amusement. He answers with a shrug and a small grin, "Nope, nothing, all peachy."

"Great! Uh, that is, great!" Sam cuts in quickly, looking at the watch on his wrist in a very deliberate motion. "Well, it's late, and it's been a hell of a day. Think I'll hit bed now."

Dean hums an acknowledgement, takes another drink slowly, then asks thoughtfully, "Don't you think, after the sun was gone and then came back, shouldn't the time be reset or something? Like, it's a new day or whatever? Hell, it's probably a whole new era when future historians look back. We got a BC/AD two thousand years ago, about time for another one. What should we call it? BD/AG, Before-Darkness and After-God era?"

Sam lets out a short chuckle, "Wow, Aristotle, I'll leave you to think about that." He stands up and pats his brother on the shoulder briefly, nods at Cass on his way out, and then disappears outside of the kitchen door.

Dean and Cass look at the direction where Sam took off, taking gulps of drink almost simultaneously, enjoying the comfortable lazy silence between them for a while longer.

Then they chat, they talk and laugh, and share old funny stories. At first Cass mostly just listens and Dean does most of the talking. After several rounds, everything gets dizzy and light-headed, Cass loosens up and talks just as much. Dean laughs at his jokes that are probably not even very funny so hard that he has to wipe off the tears from the corner of his eyes.

After god knows how long, Dean finally decides to put down his drink and glance at his watch. "Guess Sam is right, as much as I'd like to stay, I'm probably too old for the overnight carnival and celebration now. Need to pass out for a couple hours." He stands up staggeringly, his eyes can barely stay open now, he'll own that to more tiredness than drunkenness.

"I understand." Cass stands up too, follows him out of the kitchen and helps Dean get back to his room before his crooked footsteps take any wrong turn.

"Get some rest, Dean." Cass says, his hands holding some of Dean's weight until making sure he's secure on his own bed. Then he gestures the other end of the corridor, "I'll just take the guest room."

"Good night, Cass." Dean mumbles, though Castiel suspects he might already fell in sleep before finishing the sentence.

Cass turns off the light, lingering by the door in the dark for two seconds too long. "Good night, Dean."

#### Act 2

Something is wrong.

Something is always wrong, as they often say, with them being Winchesters. But this feels... not really *wrong* wrong, but *off*.

"I don't know how to tell you, Sammy, it's like my hair is in the wrong direction, or... or spider sense gets triggered or something." Dean is a bit irritated, hands flying everywhere trying vainly to compensate for the lack of accurate words. "My gut says so, okay? And I know better than ignoring a hunter's instinct. Something is definitely off but I don't know what. It's like forgetting a dream you just had two seconds ago."

Sam presses his palms on the forehead. They shouldn't have this conversation before they even have their first cup of coffee of the day. And this definitely shouldn't be how the second day after saving the universe starts. But here they are.

"Your gut telling you anything else? A bit more details?" Sam lets his fingers handle the coffee machine in autopilot mode, presses the power button after putting in everything, and turns back to face his brother. "Heaven? Hell? Up? Down? From anywhere? Anyone we can call?"

"It's my gut, Sam," Dean stares at him, "not Google, how the hell would I know?"

Sam sighs, "You sure it's not a post-traumatic stress something? Or a nightmare? Maybe you should just take some more rest. You did only stand up face to face with the full-power Darkness and almost died yesterday after all."

Dean rounds his eyes, his voice on the edge of snapping. "I know what PTSD is, and this ain't that, alright?"

Sam debates whether to point out that Dean didn't handle that well after he came back from Hell or Purgatory no matter how he pretended to be, maybe this is just like those times. But judging by Dean's face, he swallows the thought back. "You talked to Cass about that yet?" is what he decides to go with.

"No..." Dean pauses, looks around, pauses again, and then almost amused, "Did... did he oversleep even later than us?"

Sam throws up his hands to mean "I have no idea".

The next thought coming immediately after hits both of them at the same moment. Dean stiffens and Sam straights up from pouring newly made coffee, they share a tense look.

It can't be good. Angels don't sleep, and the few other times when Cass did sleep, he's either dying of a lack of grace or already became human. Or worse, the no-show could be another quiet leave without goodbye where he decides to do his own things, and that usually doesn't turn out very well.

Dean and Sam rush towards the guest room.

Dean gets there first and starts bumping on the door. "Cass, you in there?" He raises voice over his own pounding noise.

A mumbling voice answers from inside, but sounds a hell lot like moaning. Dean lets out a breath that he doesn't know he was holding, but almost immediately holds it again.

They both tilt head and stick closer to the door trying to hear better what Cass is saying, but the door that usually is too thin to hold anything back suddenly seems too sound-proof now to catch any sentence.

Dean takes two steps back and lifts one leg, ready to kick his way in, and Sam is right on time to put a hand in front of him to stop, "Whoa, hey, you want to maybe try turn the door knob first?"

Dean gives him a glance, not at all guilty of not thinking straight, "Good idea."

He turns the door knob, and the door opens obediently. Dean deliberately ignores Sam's look on the back of his head.

Cass is in the room, sitting by his clean and clearly not-slept-on bed, hands pressed firmly on the temple, eyes shut tight, looking too concentrated that it looks very close to pain.

Dean dashes inside, holding him around the shoulder, shaking slightly, "Hey, hey Cass, buddy, what's wrong? What happened?"

Cass looks like he has to take great effort to put his hands down and set the volume in his head lower before he can even try to start talking.

"It's angel radio." He looks at Dean with a grimace, his face wrinkled with pain, "Something is happening to the angels, they're getting sick and dying fast. From what I can hear, it's contagious and deadly. So much voice, so much agony. I have to go now."

"Wait, wait, hold on a sec, Cass, not so fast." Dean presses him back to bed right when he tries to stand up. "Contagious and deadly, you say?"

Cass nods, "Yes, it appears so."

"And you are, what, just gonna walk straight into it?" Dean's eyes are practically literally glaring now, "Like a man walking into a Black Death plague town?"

Cass stares at him, voice starting to get harsh, "Yes! I am not a man, and I have to know more. Angels are dying, I can't just sit here doing nothing!"

"Well, you can't help if you're dead or sick too." Dean points out, then adds half-jokingly, "Besides, who cares if a few flying monkeys died, not like they're so friendly or helpful in the past. Hell, personally I still think there are too many of them around, might as well..."

"Dean." Sam warns quietly, and Dean shuts up just in time.

Cass shakes off Dean's hands from his shoulder and stands up quickly, steps away from him, his eyes are furious now, and maybe also a little something like hurt. Dean can't say he didn't flinch. It reminds him so much of the very first time seeing Castiel in that barn. Even without his wings, Cass can sometimes still be very intimidating, terrifying even.

"Sorry, didn't mean to..." Dean starts but gets cut off.

Cass grits his teeth, "In case you forget, *I* happen to also be one of the 'flying monkeys'." The air quotes almost get Dean choked on his own unintended laughter. He has to fight hard to stop the face muscle from twitching.

"They might be ass-butts from time to time, but they are still my brothers and sisters." Castiel says sternly, Dean avoids his glares and can't help but feel hurt. Even if he understands, he really does, but still, the word "brother" might just mean differently sometimes.

"So yes, I am going back to Heaven to see what's happening, to save them if I can. Or die trying." Castiel concludes.

"We'll go with you." Words slip out of Dean's tongue before his brain catches what he's saying.

"Dean, you sure?" Sam voices, Dean almost forgets he's still there.

Cass' expression gets slightly softer, "No, you can't, Dean. It will kill you, and you know that. No human can be in Heaven. I have to go alone."

"Or ask the sick ones come down here?" Dean suggests hopefully, "So you don't have to be around all those coughing sneezing guys."

"Cass, do we know if this angel sickness can pass on to human?" Sam asks cautiously.

Cass looks at Sam for the first time after they burst into his room. "I don't think so." he says, "Angels technically don't exist in the same dimension as humans, we only manifest into this dimension when we need to. So whatever this is, I don't think it can cross dimension."

"Awesome," Dean's whole body loosens up slightly, "good to know humans won't extinct because the flying dudes poke at the wrong place."

"But I don't think they can be moved to Earth or if they'd be willing to." Cass looks back at Dean again.

"Why not?"

"Would you be willing to go to a strange new place, like abroad or the Moon, when you're seriously sick and dying?" Cass squints his eyes.

"Fair point." Sam admits while Dean makes a funny little defeated sound with nose.

"So can we all agree now that I need to go? Alone, and immediately?" Cass sighs, getting noticeably more impatient as time passes by.

Sam opens and closes his mouth a few times, looks like he still tries to object but doesn't know what to say. Dean stares at one far end on the ground past Cass, eyes unfocused, seems to be deep in thought.

Cass walks towards the door.

"What if," Dean holds out a finger, but still locks his eyes on that spot on the floor, not out of the contemplate, "what if you become human?"

The room falls silent, Dean looks up to meet two x-ray gazes that are so sharp that he almost can feel the cut on his skin. He shifts his feet uncomfortably. "Hear me out, you said humans can't get infected by this angelic black death, right? And you had been back to Heaven before even without or with little of your grace. So think of being a human like having a dose of vaccine, what if we somehow drain your grace to *almost* like a human, keep it safe, you go there, poke around, solve the problem, and come back juicing up again, voila, problem solved."

"Dean," Sam sighs, "I don't even want to start on how many things can go wrong there."

"I'm not saying I like it." Dean eyes him, then focuses back on the only angel in the room, "Hell, even *I* hate myself for saying that, God knows how tough it is every time see you lose your mojo, but it's still better than deadly sick or die, a thousand times better."

Castiel considers carefully.

Dean studies him and waits.

Sam watches them both. Like how things have always been between them.

"So?" Dean asks hopefully, "Would it work?"

"Probably." Cass says solemnly and slowly. The way he tilts his head, it looks like he's half thinking, half tuning back to the angel radio again.

"Great." Dean says cheerfully, gesturing to his brother and mouthing a silent "See? I'm a genius." Sam snorts with a light curl on the edge of the lip.

"So what do we need?" Sam asks.

"Nothing we don't already have in the bunker." Cass heads towards one of the stock rooms by the library, Sam and Dean follow him closely.

<br>

#### Act 3

Cass rummages through the drawers in the stock room, making all kinds of noises as random items get moved around.

"There." After a few minutes, Cass fetches a wooden box out of the top drawer, taking it back to the library table.

Inside the box, there is a syringe and a flask. The wooden brown cover of the flask has some mysterious illegible markings and patterns on it, so it might be somewhat unusual or magical, while the syringe looks just ordinary enough to blend in any hospital.

"That's it?" Dean eyes them curiously, somehow expecting something fancier.

"Yes." Cass hands him both items, "You can use that to extract my life force and store them in the flask. I expect you may need to repeat the process a few times before I'm drained."

Dean swallows, he doesn't like how the word "drained" sounds like, not at all.

"You sure it's safe?" Dean takes the two things from him, feeling uneasy.

"No," Castiel answers in a low but steady voice, "but as you say, we may not have a better option. I would hope we can execute the process near the gate, so I don't need to stay in the feeble state for longer time than necessary."

Dean pulls a cheerless smile, "Don't use the word 'execute', will you, buddy? Now I feel like an executioner."

Sam clears his throat behind them to remind the timing.

Dean turns to the garage. "I'll get Baby ready in five."

<br>

#### Act 4

The gate is not guarded by any angel. The whole playground is totally empty, no sign of any human or angel. Considering most of the angels are busy tendering their new disease outburst, it's more or less expected.

Dean still frowns at the place. He never likes this place, after the angels made the playground a Heaven elevator portal, nothing good ever happened every time anyone is near here.

The air in the Impala goes quiet for a few minutes after the car parks, all three of them fall into their own thoughts, before Dean breaks the silence. "You ready?" He turns to Cass in the back seat.

"Just do it." Castiel answers gravely.

There is not much space in the Impala to make it a comfortable surgery table, so they have to make do. Castiel leans back on the back seat next to the door with his eyes closed, Dean holds the syringe tight and close to his skin near the neck, and Sam holds the flask besides him, watching them with his worried eyes.

Dean swallows, eyes wandering around Castiel's vulnerable bare skin by the throat, remembering this is exactly how every time he got his throat cut and grace taken, now he's trusting him to do the exact same worst thing to himself. Dean has to use his left hand to steady the right one, like holding a gun for the first time.

Dean takes another breath, and finally pushes out for the last inch. It turns out that it is fairly easy to stab a needle into someone's neck and start extracting -- or maybe it's just that the angel biology being different from human. Bright glowing light starts flowing into the syringe, Dean can't help stare at the beautiful light in there, his eyes get caught by the color and brightness of the light uncontrollably, his heart bumps with a sudden knowledge that to some extent, he might be looking at Cass' true form right now, no matter how small the portion is.

When he tears his eyes away, Dean notices Cass clenches his teeth tight with deep lines between his brows. His breath catches pace too, getting deeper and quicker, clearly enduring some huge pain.

Dean stops immediately, though the syringe is already pretty full with grace. He takes the needle out of Cass, asking eagerly with a hand landed on angel's shoulder, "How you feeling?"

"Continue." Cass breathes out the single word between his gritted teeth.

Dean sighs, pushes the tube into the flask, and starts extracting the second time. And then the third.

Cass looks worse by each minute, sweat rolling down from his forehead, his body sliding down weakly on the seat.

"Okay I don't think we should..." Dean frowns deeply and ready to give up on this terrible plan, Cass is just looking awful.

Castiel grabs his wrist to prevent him from taking the needle out. "Keep. Going." His voice hoarse and husky.

"Tell me I'm not killing you." Dean growls at him.

"You are not." Cass has to catch a breath between every few words, "You're doing the right thing." His eyes are still closed tight, probably to hold back the pain, Dean thinks.

"Yeah sometimes the right thing sucks." Dean barks, "Tell me when to stop."

He can see the light in the syringe is already getting noticeably thinner, he can almost vividly imagine the mojo tank inside Cass getting lower as he drains.

"Almost there." Cass holds both hands on the edge of the seat to prevent himself from further sliding down, but even his fingers are too weak now to really do anything. His knuckles are white, more sweat pouring down.

Dean sees it all. "Okay we'll call it a day." He decides, gives up waiting for Cass' signal, taking the syringe away and handing to Sam, like he can't bear to hold the damn thing one more second, like it's a criminal evidence that he's hurting Cass.

Cass breathes heavily, his chest rising up and down with rhythms of an uneven tide on the edge of a storm. Dean feels just as shitty and can't stop beating himself in his mind.

"Ready to take a walk?" He means to use a light joking tone but fails, the concern and worry leaking from his eyes into his voice.

Cass finally opens his eyes and looks back. Dean thinks even the blue in his eyes fades somewhat with the lack of grace, but maybe it's just the effect of the light.

Cass tries to climb out of the Impala on his own but staggers so much he almost falls to the ground, Dean lends his shoulder to help and holds him to the gate.

"Think you'll be alright going upstairs and coming back by yourself?" Dean hesitates by the edge when Cass steps onto the sand.

Cass gives him a weak nod. "I'll be back as soon as possible." He says, and then the portal lights up.

Sands rise and spin like a mini-sandstorm. Cass lets out a moan that sounds far too close to a suppressed silent scream, as if he is being burnt alive or torn apart by horses running different directions but uses all his power to swallow back that pain so that Dean might miss it. But Dean didn't. Dean yells his name, can't help himself from instantly reaching out a hand and almost stepping on to the sand, trying to drag Cass back down.

"No, Dean! Don't!" Real panic echoes in Cass' voice.

Dean feels their fingers might have touched for a split second, but immediately there is a force throwing him out. He stumbles back a few steps, by the time he re-steadies himself, the sandstorm has settled down, and Castiel is no longer there.

<br>

### Chapter 2: Heaven on Edge

#### Act 1

Dean walks back to the Impala with a gloomy face, bending over the roof with fingers folded, frowning so hard into the deep space as if he can use the bare stare to tear open the air and squeeze himself into Heaven to help.

"Uh," Sam clears his throat to get his attention, "you want to find a place to rest? He can take days, you know, in case you're thinking about waiting here all the time."

"I'm not leaving until he's back." Dean snaps, his voice way too harsh than necessary. "You see the state he's in just now, he'll need us when he comes back." He thinks and adds, "And he might come back anytime."

"Right." Sam lets out a light sound that's almost like a chuckle if not counting the deep worry, "That's what I thought."

They wait in silence for a long while.

The sun sets down quickly. Dean doesn't pay any attention.

Sam shuffles his feet to keep body warm as the night falls, he asks bluntly, "Is this how things like when you guys were in the Purgatory?"

Dean tilts his head towards him, shooting him a questioning look.

"You know, the whole 'not leaving without him' thing." Sam adds quietly, and then quickly shakes his head, "Sorry, didn't mean to bring it up, you probably still don't want to talk about it."

"Yes." Dean suddenly unlocks, much to Sam's surprise.

"Exactly like Purgatory." he continues, "Even more so when it's time to leave. It's like..." he trails off, getting lost in his memory. The image of Cass grabbing his hands and then slipping back into the monster land is still too vivid, still burns his eyes hot. Even after Cass told him the truth, this is still the memory that hit him more than it should.

"Like what?" Sam's voice brings his mind back.

"Like I can never grab anyone's hand tight enough to pull them out of misery and pain, to really save them. They're just, always, slipping from the hold. Taken away. Lost." Dean's voice cracks, his eyes reflected with shiny stars of lights. "All the time."

He keeps his eyes straight into the dark night, doesn't move for the slightest until the shininess slowly slips away.

"Dean." Sam sighs, putting a hand on his brother's shoulder briefly, "Cass will come back, he promised. He always come back to us, to you."

Dean gives him a small grateful nod. "He better does." he says huskily, "Otherwise I'll go find him myself and kick his ass."

Sam lets out a short laugh.

The air feels more breathable now.

<br>

#### Act 2

They wait and wait. Night turns to day, Sam leaves temporarily on the second day to grab some food and comes back finding Dean sitting on the bench closest to the sand, never leaves his eyes from the portal, as if he's afraid he might miss the angel if he even blinks.

"We can take turn watching." Sam offers, handing his brother a wrapped burger with extra cheese.

Dean bites the food absent-mindedly and doesn't answer. But by the night of the next day, the exhaustion wins the silent argument.

"Wake me up if anything happens. Anything." Dean presses, warningly.

"Yes, yes, Jesus." Sam rolls his eyes, "Now go! Before I drag your ass to the car."

Dean lies down on the back seat of the Impala and immediately falls asleep.

Dreams never serve him well. Those dreams about the Pit that butchers him, the Cage that swallows his brother, the glowing light that turns his best friend into something horrible, the monster land that keeps all his hair on ends, and then more. Everything he experienced, everyone he lost, he might be able to shove things to the back of the head when his mind is clear, but the dreams always seem to be able to find a way crawl back, digging the old memories back up like a fucking grave digger of his brain, reminding him how fresh those wounds still are.

He rolls uneasily on the back seat, pulling the jacket covered on him, still not wake up yet.

He is walking into a poor small middle-age-looking village. The houses are shabby, the road is dirty and stained. The whole vision looks bleak, like cutting out from a black-and-white silent movie from 20s. There is no color, no sound, no life. The stains on the road look just like dirt, or maybe what's left of horseshit, if it's an age with horse cart. He doesn't give anything much attention, just keeps walking, has a vague urgent feeling that he is doing something, that he needs to go somewhere fast, that he needs to find something -- or someone -- fast.

And then he sees them, the bodies. Piles of piles of bodies down the road, in front of the houses, down the ditches, and by the road. The stains are not smudge, he realizes, they are blood, too much blood, dripping thickly from these dead bodies, flowing and forming into a stream, and then a river. All the bodies have deadly black spots on the face and bare skins, all have a horror expression ghosting on the face long after they can sense anything anymore. All have black charred wings behind their backs.

This is an angel black death town, with no survivors. Dean realizes, horrifiedly. He walks down the road, doesn't really want to look at any of the bodies or their faces, but the image is shoved right in front of his eyes, he doesn't have an option, they're everywhere. They just look so... human. Dean feels his heart knot with apprehension.

He continues walking down the road, not sure what he's looking for or where the feet are leading him to. Until he finds someone sitting by the corner of a wall, still moving, though barely. He runs to him, kneeling down, and recognizes this is Cass in a heart beat. Except, the body almost looks nothing like the Cass he knows. He's covered with black spots everywhere like everyone else and they're still spreading, his eyes shadowed with dark fog, his mouth and nose oozing with black goo. He is dying, and Dean can do nothing to save him.

"Cass? Cass!" Dean yells. He doesn't dare to touch him, in case it causes him more pain. His hands reach out to his shoulder tentatively, hover by an inch, but take back hesitantly moments later without contact. All he can do is just keep calling his dying best friend's name.

Castiel hears him. His swollen eyes somehow manage to look through the shadow and look into his.

"Dean?" He sounds unsure, Dean's heart is clenched with pain, "Is that really you?"

"Yeah Cass, it's me." Dean uses his softest voice, "I got you."

"You come." Castiel's face twitches, and Dean realizes he tries to smile but there is not even enough muscle to pull it, he feels his heart is being cut and sliced by the sharpest surgical knife. "You come for me."

"'Course I do." Dean manages to squeeze his sound through the lump in his throat, "You're family."

"Then why, are you coming so late?" Castiel's eyes suddenly turn fierce, rolled and filled with anger and accusation and pain, "They're all dead! All of them. And now it's my turn. Where were you when we need you? Why can't you come earlier? Why can't you save us?"

Castiel suddenly straightens up his body, reaching out and grabbing him by the collar, dragging him closer and cursing to his face, "We are all dead! I'm dead! Because of you!" Dean can't bare to look at his eyes, the flame and pain shading all the blue and eating him alive, but he can't move away. He shudders.

"Dean! Dean!" Sam's voice pierces through the veil of dreamland, Dean gasps awake, breathing heavily like a drowning man fighting for air.

Sam is shaking his shoulder, looking more concerned than he already was when Cass walked into the portal.

Dean blinks at his face blankly, shadows of Cass' twisted face overlapping with Sam's, his brain is trying to catch up on the reality while half of his mind still stuck in the medieval town he left seconds ago.

"You okay?" Sam asks, hands leaving his shoulder the moment he sits up, "Bad dream?"

Dean rubs his neck. "Yeah," he fake moans, "not the best place to spend the night, you know."

Sam examines him, urges to point out that Impala seats usually don't make a person scream angel's name in their dream, but on second thought, he ends up biting his tongue because he knows far too well Dean wouldn't say a thing.

"Any news?" Dean walks out of the car, still rubbing his back and around waist. The night is a little chilly. It's not entirely a lie that sleeping in the car is doing terrible things to his almost-forty-year-old spine.

"Nothing changed." Sam answers, "I don't see a single sand move."

Dean nods, and sits back on the bench by the Heaven's gate, silently taking the watch again.

<br>

#### Act 3

Cass comes back at the night of the fourth day.

And he lands clumsily, as if he's shoved down the portal, falling all the way down from the sky and crashing on the ground. Lucky that the sand looks soft enough for the landing that he doesn't break bones, but his body still makes quite a big thump noise.

Dean and Sam jump to their feet and rush to the messy human figure covered by the crumpled beige trench coat.

"Cass?" Dean gets there first, carefully sets a foot on the sand and puts a hand on his back.

Cass moans weakly, it sounds like even the moaning itself is giving him much pain. His face touches the ground, buried beneath the trench coat like the most of his body. Dean carefully gets the coat out of the way.

Cass is bleeding, blood dripping out of his mouth and corners of his eyes. Cuts and slices are everywhere on his cheeks, neck, hands and any bare skin. His lips are pale white. The shirt is bloody too but Dean can't spare another second to examine. Cass is closing his eyes slowly, like the eyelids are too heavy to hold up and he's just too tired that he wants nothing but to fall into sleep. There is only some last remnant of sparkling blue left in his pupils, which is going out rapidly like a light bulb with switch turned off.

"Hey, hey! Stay with me, Cass, you hear me?" Dean palms his cheeks gently, feeling his hands quickly covered with sticky blood. The air smells rusty.

"Sammy!" Dean's voice is packed with trembling fear. "Flask!"

The warm wooden flask is slammed into his hands with lid taken off.

Dean puts a hand beneath Cass' head, posturing his head up a little and holding the opening of the flask right in front of his mouth.

"Come on, buddy." He murmurs, close to begging or praying. "Come back to me."

Starry flowing light spreads out of the flask, rising and flying in the air like a dance of pure light before sliding into the thin slit between Cass' lips.

"Cass?" Dean lays his head back to ground gently, reaching a finger beneath his nose to feel the breath. Faint air pushes onto his skin, but it only gets weaker and thinner, until completely undetectable.

Dean's heart bleeds painfully. Is it too late? Did they make a terrible mistake and kill Cass, again? And this time, he did it himself? He shuts his eyes and feels his chest too tight to breathe.

The lamps around the playground start flickering, lights going on and off, and then explode one by one.

"Dean!" Sam calls out alarmingly, gun dropped into hands instantly.

Dean snaps open his eyes and checks on Cass immediately.

Castiel has opened his eyes, though his look is remote and unfocused. Bright blue light fills into his pupil, spreading to his face, his body, and then the space around him. The light soon gets too bright to look, Dean has to look away and cover his eyes with a raised elbow. The air is buzzing with static electricity and heat.

There is a flow of energy rushing towards them and passing by their sides without doing any harm. A word suddenly pops into Dean's mind: "solar wind." He has seen it from some science channel on motel TV some long time ago, introducing how the sun's activity can let out electrical waves and winds of particles that almost look like a visible wind. A wind made of light. That must be what is happening now. Castiel, this beautiful holy creature of light, is letting out a bright rare wonder but he can't see it with his bare eyes, just like he can't look at the Sun. What a loss. Dean is silently in awe for the very few times when he starts to clearly realize the meaning of the word "Angel".

When the buzzing electrical feeling dies down, Dean turns back and opens his eyes again.

Castiel sits up with eyes wide and gentle, locked on him.

"Dean." He says, his sound familiar and deep, though maybe slightly sad and tired, but at least he's not weak or dying or anything. The wounds and cuts all disappeared, and no sign of blood anywhere.

Here he is, Angel of the Lord with a capital "A", fresh and new. Dean can't stop a smile unfurling on his face. "Cass!" He lets out a long relieved breaths, then punches the angel on the shoulder, "Don't do that again!"

Next to them, Sam also exhales in relief.

Dean stands up and holds a hand to pull Cass up. When they head back to Impala and drive back to bunker, Dean even starts humming his favorite Zeppelin song when the tape rotates to "Ramble On." Sam eyes him with raised surprised eyebrow, receives a beaty head drum  following the rhythm in reply, and can't stop beaming. The weight on Dean's shoulder is visibly so much lighter now it looks like as if he can float.

Seriousness kicks back in when Dean glances at Cass from the rear mirror and notices his still tensed shoulder. He tunes down the music.

"Okay Cass, fill us in. First thing first, how are you feeling?" Dean asks.

"I'm fine." the angel in the back seat answers, "Not dying, that's an improvement."

Dean narrows his eyes, "What happened up there? Why were you dying again? Did the angels hurt you?" Anger building up fast, he turns back to look at Cass directly, his right foot unconsciously presses on the accelerator pedal.

"Road, dude, road! Look at the road!" Sam cries out loud.

Dean looks back at the road quickly, releasing the foot pad, the car returns to its previous speed.

Dean still doesn't give up stealing glances of Cass from the mirror. "Is there a name? Anyone I can punch?"

Cass looks like he's struggling with words. Dean frowns. He knows the look, that's the look every time Cass holds something back, usually right before sacrificing himself for something -- or someone. He doesn't like that look.

"Is the problem solved? The disease?" Sam helps out by starting with easy questions, Cass chooses to go with that first.

"No," he sighs, "it's not that easy."

"Of course not." Dean echoes, unsurprisedly.

"And, if you really want to know, angels didn't do anything to me, it's just how Heaven works. Without grace, as far as Heaven concerns, I'm just a human, so it would want to keep me there. It wasn't easy to come back. If I'm honest, I didn't even think I could make it." Cass averts his eyes to look at the window, though there is really nothing to see except for pure black.

Dean growls at the road ahead of him, "You knew this is gonna kill you and you did it anyway?"

Cass counters weakly, "No."

Their eyes meet in the mirror, Cass stares back at Dean's glaring eyes, "Yes? Maybe? I don't know how bad it will be, alright? I just saw there might be a shot to help and I took it! Like you and Sam always do!"

Dean is visibly annoyed, "Okay pal, new rule, from now on, every time you need to make a move, tell us everything you know, capiche? Man, we should have this rule like forever ago."

Cass grumbles with widened eyes, "I capiche."

Dean holds back a success grin, "Good." And then, "Now back to square one, what do we know about the situation up there?"

<br>

#### Act 4

It is bad.

Cass knows it's bad before he goes there, but the view still catches him off guard. He gasps in disbelief and pain.

He has never seen so many angels being so vulnerable and miserable.

He has seen enough angels wounded or permanently damaged from the war back in the days when he was still in the garrison. His own hands have been covered with too much angel blood in the days when he did the worst wrong of all time. But none of that could compare with what he's seeing now.

It is not like war. It is not massacre. It is extinction.

Full-scale, whole-species, extinction.

The power supply in the Heaven is shaking violently. Power emergency alarm goes off every few seconds. Time flows differently on Heaven and on Earth, and for the mere seconds he sets foot on Heaven, it already weighs more than the eons he has existed.

Angels are dying. Dying in their true forms.

In the Heaven, angels usually choose not to carry their vessels around. So it can be difficult for humans to comprehend -- as he explains to Sam and Dean, if it's easier for them to imagine, maybe think about suited-up staffs walking around office hallways, but it's nothing like that.

From what he perceives, their existences are more like clusters of light and energy, dispersing and aggregating across the dimensions. And all of that, is dying out. Their lights are shattering, energy draining, grace dissipating, existence disintegrating. It can be explained much easier with a scattering wave function in hyper-dimension and unbounded space, but Sam and Dean would definitely ask him to skip this part.

It's exactly like human's Black Death plague. Cass thinks, Dean is right. Except this is bigger, darker, heavier.

This pandemic is not caused by a lack of hygiene or Yersinia pestis, but by... By what? Cass has no faintest clue. What can possibly destroy angels of the Lord in this massive scale, with such absoluteness? Not single angel seems to be able to get away from the contagious symptom, dark shadows spreading from one cluster of light to another, entangled into every fiber of energy, eating away the brightness from inside out, erasing the angel's existence like antimatter devours the matter.

If the mixed painful voices in the angel radio were heartbroken, being in the Heaven among them and hearing them up close is truly unbearable. Cass feels himself being torn apart purely by the agony of the sound itself. It is most horrifying when the last bit of an angel's light gets fully eaten up by the blackness. The frequency of their last cry is the most high-pitched sound even an angel has never heard elsewhere before, piercing and scratching at the back of every angel's mind if they happen to be nearby. For Sam and Dean's understanding, as Castiel later describes, think of it as the most painful human moaning and screaming sound when they're being tortured and dying, mixed with the sound of finger nails scraping the surface of chalkboard or screeching metals.

<br>

#### Act 5

"Okay, that's vivid enough." Dean cuts him off uncomfortably, "I get it, bad, real bad, horrifying ass-level bad. About right?"

They are back at the bunker now, sitting by the war room table, beers in hand, books by their side.

Cass nods grimly.

"Umm, Cass?" Sam asks carefully, "What will happen if angels really extinct?"

Cass breathes heavily. "I can't imagine." he says after a beat.

"'You can't imagine'? What's that supposed to mean?" Dean demands with narrowed eyes.

"There will be no Heaven. All the souls in the Heaven will be cast in the wind, billions and billions of souls banished to the Vail or the Earth. Or worse, Hell. New dying souls linger in the Vail without a place to go, before the Vail cracks with the burden. That's just the start. What do you think humans would be like when they realize there is no post-life reward after they die? There will be no eternal happiness waiting for them regardless of how much good they do when they are alive or how much pain they have suffered?" Cass tilts his head again at Dean, eyes squinted.

Dean stammers, "Surely the post-life reward can't be the only thing people do good for."

"Some, maybe, but how many?" Cass sighs, "This angel disease - pandemic - thing, might not directly infect human, it might still destroy the world in the end, if given time."

Dean shares an alarmed look with Sam, "Annual world-ending event, awesome."

Cass sighs, "And there is more."

"More to this crap?!" Dean rolls his eyes.

<br>

#### Act 6

Castiel searches corridors after corridors between souls' heavenly cells, looking for angel survivors. But he doesn't have any luck.

The place spreads and unfolds endlessly, and his body as a human is tiring out and dragging him back fast. His feet sore and heavy, his mouth dry and burning, he staggers, but keeps moving, though now he has to lean on the wall to keep himself upwards. A traveler lost in the middle of desert might look better than he is right now, one thread of his mind floats away to the time when he saw that French writer pilot Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wandering in the desert, finishing his beautiful work of *Le Petit Prince*. His soul is somewhere around here too, if he remembers correctly.

He can feel cracks of wounds popping up on his face and lips, on the back of his hands, and spreading on every part of the body, like a nut shell right before it gets crushed and explodes into pieces. Blood soaking through the white shirt, he doesn't know how much time he has or how far he can keep going. This whole place, the Heaven, is folding around him, grabbing its child in its embrace like a mother to her new-born child. It is his birth place, but it's not the place he would call home right now, and certainly not the place he wants to stay at this moment. But he also doesn't think he can make it to the portal again.

"Castiel? Is that you?" An angel calls to him from around next corridor. The sound is weak and sick and only echoes its existence in his mind, but picks up sparks of hope at his approach.

Cass fights his way towards the call.

But the Heaven pushes harder, the force around him pressing heavily, like a hurricane blowing and surging over a pitiful leaf attached to a tree, pulling him towards the wall, towards a soul room manifested only for him, moving along with him, trying to absorb him in.

The wall becomes too dangerous to hold on to, but as soon as he leaves the hold, Cass' legs give way. He hisses as the human body hits the ground and sharp pain spreads all over. He'll die here, Cass thinks, becoming a permanent resident of Heaven, locked away in one of those billions of rooms and never see Dean again. He should have hugged him before leaving and said a better farewell.

"Castiel --" The other angel calls again.

"Dumah." Cass recognizes her voice.

Crawling ahead desperately with the last bit of his strength, Cass arrives at the turn of that corridor. Dumah is there, in her true form, shining faintly and fading. Black shades and dark spots get its hold on to her like every single other angel he sees in the Heaven. Judging by the density of the black, she doesn't have long.

Pain and grief tears Castiel's heart apart. The last time he felt so powerless and useless is when he has to watch Dean Winchester being tortured and sliced in the Pit while his garrison still has miles of demons to clear. He doesn't quite understand that sensation of worry and fear back then, but after spending near a decade on Earth, he realizes now that the fear is because he's afraid that he may be too late. The same fear comes back now.

"Castiel, I'm glad you are here." Dumah sends the words into his mind.

"Why -- what is happening here? What is this?" Cass frowns deeply, ignoring his own wounds cutting deeper and more blood losing from his body.

"The Darkness." Dumah's consciousness is thinning away, so is her life force. Her words can barely form apprehensible meanings through the transmission, but she is trying, holding herself together as long as she can.

Cass leans in to grab at the answer that is surfacing slowly, "But how? She had left this universe. This shouldn't happen."

"The damage was already done when she invaded Heaven last time. All angels were already infected back then, the symptoms only show later. The lower ranks died first, Cherubs, Cupids, the higher ranks came later, Seraphs too, no exception. Everyone in the Heaven will die eventually. Every. Single. One. Of. Us."

"Is that why I'm not infected? I wasn't in the Heaven at that time?" Cass can't help asking.

"Oh but you were. Because Lucifer was."

<br>

#### Act 7

Castiel doesn't remember much about anything when Lucifer walked him around. The memory is all fuzzy and vague, the image and sound from the outside world was just a low buzzing white noise signal like the one refrigerators would usually make.

He managed to find a TV and a place with the best signal in his head -- the bunker kitchen where he shared so many beers and so much laughter and jokes with the Winchesters -- and that's about it. Hours after hours, he just kept his eyes locked on the screen, which is not that different from watching bees. Tiny digital characters moving around on the screen was just like bees flying, even the buzzing sounds were familiar. Castiel didn't really mind if he had to watch them for eons without doing anything.

But then he does start to remember that day when Lucifer visited the Heaven. The same day the Darkness visited. The little TV he held close to his chest had worse signal than ever, images froze a lot, sound track was terribly delayed. It wasn't an easy day inside his own brain, but he decided he didn't really want to know what was happening out there. So he stayed in there, just staring at the snowy laggy TV screen.

And then, it happened.

The table was shaking, cabinets and shelves slipping around on the kitchen floor, crashing against the wall and falling to the ground. All the cups and glasses and things shattered to pieces. Cracks showed up on the luminous screen, fragments of glass shattering everywhere. He was afraid the TV might explode, and he briefly wondered, if it does break, how would he kill the rest of the time he'd spent in here -- which is probably, possibly, *forever*.

And then all the lights went out completely at the same time. The whole room fell into pure darkness, and the floor just continued shaking like an earthquake. The gravity direction shifted quickly, changing from downwards to sidewards then upwards. Cass got thrown across room, hitting the wall next to the door, and then got mercilessly thrown onto the ceiling of the room, crashing onto the ceiling lamp by his back bone, feeling glass and metals stabbed into his skin, and finally ended up with all fours on the ground again, bloodied and motion-sickened.

He sort of expected Lucifer might show up after that, bragging about what he did today, his cocky voice floating around, filling the space. But no, the Devil didn't show that day. Actually he didn't even see him for quite a while after that. Lucifer must be busy, busy saving the world as he promised, Castiel distantly hoped, but even if he didn't keep his promise, he was sure Sam and Dean would figure something out. They always do, and Castiel only hope this archangel weapon he secured by his body could make that task easier for them.

Castiel didn't connect the dots together then, but he does now. That incident of mere seconds, must be the exact time when the Darkness invaded the Heaven and blew everyone up, Lucifer included.

<br>

#### Act 8

"Then how am I still alive, not infected?" Cass rushes his questions, "I should have symptoms just like everyone else."

The cluster of light and energy that is Dumah contracts and shifts, sounding lighter by each word. "You... you remember." Her rusty voice chokes, breaking and catching, "Lucifer must ward you off. That's why... why I'm hoping you can fix this, Castiel. Use that power, save us, save the Heaven."

"But I don't know how --" Cass feels uneasy and shameful.

"You will find out." Dumah's voice barely there, breaking and gasping, it's like human coughing violently. Black shapes and spots splash from the light around her core, like flying ash and coal from an overburnt fireplace.

And then she starts chanting, breathlessly, like the dying song of a thorn bird, "*And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.*"

"I wish I share your belief." Cass murmurs sadly, "But I'm sorry, I'm dying too, I don't even think I can leave this place any more than you do."

Dumah looks *through* him with the remaining flicker of her light that is barely there, "You will, Castiel. You are the one starts it all, you will fix this. And quickly, save all the remaining ones before it's too late." Her voice breaks into agonizing scratching sound. If she's in a vessel now, it's like she's choking on blood in her throat.

Castiel senses two forces pushing at him at this very same moment as she stops speaking. The Heaven unleashes ever more power onto him, undeniably irresistibly drawing him in. Castiel can see the space and dimension around them get twisted so contorted that the exit is just like the pinpoint in the eye of a furious hurricane. And Dumah, explodes from the very last peck of power she has left in the center of the light, the wave throws Castiel across the corridor that was never really a corridor and hustles him out towards the gate. He falls right through the portal.

<br>

#### Act 9

"The next thing I know, I'm on Earth again." Cass wraps up his telling.

"Well, that explains the clumsy landing." Dean comments.

"And the cause of the infection." Sam fills in, thinking hard, "At least now we know what we're dealing with. This, this angel darkness disease --"

"I still prefer calling it ABD -- Angelic Black Death." Dean cuts.

"Fine, this ABD, how do we fix it?" Sam frowns deeply.

Dean glares back, "Don't look at me, I don't know jack squat about angel biology, how the hell are we gonna play doctor?"

Both brothers shoot their questioning eyes at Cass.

Cass blinks once blankly, looking back at them just as idealess as they are.

Sam clears his throat, suggesting in an over-optimistic voice that sounds far too deliberate, "Okay, how about we stick to the basics, work with what we know, do some research, just like it's just another case?"

"A case," Dean snorts loudly, "Fan-freaking-tastic."

He takes a large gulp of beer that's been staying idly for too long and getting heated by the room temperature and tasting bitter, before saying, "Do you remember our job used to be beheading vampires and werewolves? Not babysitting or feeding them with soup when they get sick?" He holds out a finger just in time to stop Sam from arguing, "Don't give me that look, tell me you don't think angels are just monsters with good PR? No offence, Cass." He flashes a quick eye at Cass. A slow nerve at the back of his head somewhere tickles and tells him that's a really asshole comment spitting in front of his only and best angel friend. But with the brain mostly affected by the light drowsiness coming from the beer, Dean waves the uneasy feeling off not knowing where it comes from or why.

Castiel barely moves his lips, "None taken."

Sam sighs, "I don't like them any more than you do, Dean, I mean, obviously except for Cass. But that doesn't mean I -- *we* -- would want them all dead. It's bad that they are around, but it's worse if they're not. I'd rather help them out this once rather than dealing with billions of angry confusing spirits. So yeah, I'm fine with this. And maybe, if they own us one, next time they show up, we won't have to kill each other again."

Dean snorts again and louder, "I'd rather hope they never show up in our doorsteps again. But okay, points taken. Where do we start?"

Sam looks at the only angel in the room, which makes Dean turn his head in the same direction. "Start with what we know, about Cass." Sam says.

Dean frowns, still talking to Sam but not leaving his eyes away from Cass, "Well, with all due respect, first of all, he's probably the least typical of an angel by now, with all the resurrection -- not that I complain -- and hanging around on Earth with us all this time -- still not complaining -- and everything in between, I won't be surprised if we end up finding out he's a whole new species on his own. And B, what are you gonna do about him? Anatomy? He's not a guinea pig for you to learn biology in college class. He's Cass!"

Cass hums a soft agreement to that obvious accurate comment.

Sam rolls his eyes at his brother, "I know that, Dean, thanks for reminding. I just mean, research --" He gestures to the mountain of books around them, "-- so will you just shut up and start reading, please?"

Dean returns a cheerless smile to that, "Super. I'll grab some more beer first."

<br>

#### Act 10

It turns out, that the researching and heavy reading part of the job is actually not as boring as one might presume. It would be easier if there is some kind of catalogue to indicate what each book is about, but the perk of not having one is that you get to run into things you totally wouldn't expect to read and ends up might actually learning something or even enjoying the reading time.

Like the one Dean is currently reading, "Ethereal Archetypes and Terrestrial Manifestation: A Comprehensive Ontological Examination of Transcendent Parallels between Angelic Entities and Biological Life Forms", turns out to be pretty much listing all known animals and pointing out their similarities and differences with an angel. And Dean has to hold back his laughter from time to time, and uses part of the brain to remind himself not looking up at Cass -- who sits just couple feet away from him, buried in his selection of books -- every other page just because how accurate the description is.

The book says the angels might adopt their ways of manifestation by learning all animal behaviors, including but not limited to the man kind, examples including the way they tilt heads to look at target object comes from birds, most likely pigeons, they can be protective like dogs, cunning like cats, and show great connection and closeness with creatures that last as long as they do, so they may guard jellyfish and bees as closely as humans.

The more Dean reads, the more he feels like he has to introduce Cass to whoever writes this book, it is almost as if they are literally describing Cass back to him. But pitifully, the behavioral descriptions are not giving enough information or indication about how exactly can they cure a sick angel. So Dean tosses the book aside, putting a note in his head thinking he might ask Cass some day about what's the deal with jellyfish.

The next book talks about perceived hierarchy and social structure of Heaven and Hell and their resemblance, which leads to its religious and cultural meaning. But Dean already notices some mistakes in the book, since he seriously doubts if any of the writers have ever run into any Prince of Hell or Knight of Hell. He might as well run a fact check with Cass about these things.

The next is about angelic occupational division, followed by experimentations with angel feathers, and then more. Okay, Dean decides, he wants to take his words back, it stops being entertaining a long ago, now he'd rather go out get some stretch or maybe punch something. The only thing that keeps him continue scrambling the pages is the thought that he might learn more about bits and pieces about angels -- about Cass -- that might come handy later down the road.

By the time he clears out all the books piled on his left side, Dean can barely recognize the word "angel". His brain has already rewired the meaning of that word into -- "Cass".

Right around the time when Dean wonders if he can sneak out of the room without the rest two of them noticing, Sam shouts out his eureka, "I find something! Hmm, maybe. I think."

"Aren't you a scholarship boy." Dean gratefully lays down the book in his hands that must have more than a thousand pages with packed tiny fonts and without any picture, and gets up promptly, "What do you get?"

Dean and Cass gather around him, each taking a side of the chair and leaning on the armrest.

Sam fingers the line he's reading. It's Enochian. Apparently Sam must have learnt to read Enochian some time ago secretly and Dean is the only one in the room blinking blankly right now.

Cass translates, "*The brightest of all light can purify darkness.*"

Sam points at a short line of hand-written notes in the margin right by the Enochian, "I'm actually reading this note."

Dean leans closer, "'*Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that.*' Why does that sound so familiar?"

Sam answers enthusiastically, "Martin Luther King Jr., guy is a legend, like Gandhi."

"And that's connected to our problem how?" Dean frowns, letting go for once to not mock at Sam's obsession with these historical figures that he can never understand.

"I'm thinking," Sam grooms through his thoughts, "if ABD is a symptom when angels get in too close contact with darkness, and angels' true forms are like flowing lights, then it's practically *literally* saying 'Light is getting consumed by the Darkness'. With the opposite of light -- the absence of light -- in their system, angels can't recover, that's why they're dying, and eventually all lights gone and they end up dead. It sort of makes sense."

"And so the cure is... giving them more light?" Dean catches up, connecting the lines and dots.

"Yeah, it's either that or... but I don't think we can get Chuck or Amara back to fix this -- even if we can, to be honest, I don't really want to see them again so soon." Sam ponders, "So the only option is just this --"

"-- the brightest of all light." Cass finishes his sentence. "But what does that mean? Who has -- or, what *is* -- the brightest light?"

Realization hits all three of them at the same time. Though it comes with different names.

Sam stuns and breathes, "Lucifer."

At the very same moment, Castiel says, "Michael."

Dean blinks once, then goes, "Cass."

Sam turns to Cass, "What?"

Dean eyes Sam, "Really?"

Cass looks at Dean, "Yes?"

Dean stutters, "No, not calling you. Just thought you get pretty bright light, buddy, so bright it almost burned my eyes off, like, yesterday. Pretty sure it's the brightest *I*'ve ever seen."

Castiel lowers his head sheepishly, "I'm flattered, Dean. If it's true, I have no problem giving away any and all of the light I have to save the angels. But sadly it is not, I'm hardly bright at all from angel standard right now, with all the extraction and revival."

Dean can't help breathing out a short relief, not sure if he should feel glad or sorry for it. He murmurs a quick "Sorry" under his breath.

Sam is still staring at Cass. "Michael?" his tone incredulous.

Cass turns to him to answer, "Yes, as far as I know, Michael is the first archangel God's created, strongest and the most powerful among all angels and archangels, it wouldn't be a surprise if he is also the brightest."

Sam nods slightly but still not fully convinced, "Doesn't Lucifer also have a name called 'Morningstar'? I thought before the Fall, he was believed to be the brightest by many according to the lore. I mean, isn't that's why Michael and Lucifer fight in the first place? Fighting for the title of 'brightest' and 'God's favorite', it's like the Heaven's version of Golden Apple Contest, and Armageddon is exactly like Trojan War."

"Jesus, when can we ever break free from these two bastards." Dean whines loudly before Cass can answer, then asks, "Say we have two candidates, what's next?"

"We need them to, uhh --" Sam reads through the small texts below the Enochian line, his brows raises higher if it's even possible, "huh -- give away their light willingly. The cost of purification can take away as much as all the light from the source. And only a determined mind can last long enough to not disrupt the purification process before complete."

Dean steps away from the armchair slowly to lean on the table. "Wait so, let me get this straight, the solution is to let Michael *or* Lucifer to -- what? Willingly sacrifice themselves to save all angels and humans? You ever met those two? Don't think it's gonna happen."

Sam thinks about it for a second, "I don't know Dean, I mean, we got God himself -- and Devil, Darkness, even Death -- talking to us, and persuaded them to do the right thing, and most of times, they end up listening to us."

"We might as well put up a sign in front of the bunker: 'Celestial family drama counseling office', subtitle: 'For free once a year, if it doesn't work, feel free to end the world'. Nice plan, Dr. Phil." Dean waves his hands in the air, gesturing the imaginary signs.

"You get a better one?" Sam raises his brows.

Dean stammers, looking at Cass for support, and in return the angel only gestures to Sam, very clearly showing the sign of "You know Sam is right" without actually saying it.

Dean sighs annoyedly, "When can we get out of this we'll-end-the-world-or-the-world-will-end crap? Shit just never stop hitting fans!"

Cass gives him a upset smile.

Sam sighs a soft "Yeah" and falls to silence.

### Chapter 3: Rock Never Dies

**(outline: look for Lucifer, Lucifer holds rock concert/metal festival in LA, a big fuss and fight like in show, reuse Vince/Ladyheart part plot, bring Lucifer in in Vince's vessel, help Lucifer recover)**

#### Act 1

Vince Vincente is not having a good day.

The show tonight was actually great, Tommy and the rest of the band were excited, the crowd was loud. Though honestly, he doesn't see the point of having a regroup for the Ladyheart, he's just doing those old friends a favor.

"They are hosting the biggest rock metal festival on the planet and they invited us." Tommy told him on the phone when he was driving half way across the country. He didn't bother to ask who are "they" but just listened.

"I think it would be nice to have a reprise, you know? Get a few concerts for some practice run, find the old feelings like we are still twenties." Tommy talked faster and faster, undoubtedly taken away by the thought.

"And then in the festival, bang, we show, we sing, we might go back on top again. Who knows, it can be another 1985 Live Aid again, you might regret the rest of your life if you turn this down. So what do you say? You in it with us, Vince?" Tommy urged him.

"Okay then." Vince answered plainly, uninterested but he knew better than disappointing the only few friends he still had.

"Oh and, one more thing," Tommy added slightly hesitantly, "it's gonna be in LA, you ok with that?"

He is not ok with it. Not at all. He said "sure" back then in the phone just to make Tommy's life easier, but it's making his life back to Hell again.

"Jen." Vince sits down in front of the makeup mirror, looking at the photo of the woman he loved and lost thirty years ago.

This place, Los Angeles, it's where everything between them started and ended. He has been avoiding the place for thirty years, but now he's back again.

Memory devours him like rising tide devouring a novice surfer. Vince can't really breath, his chest is clenched tight.

(outline: From Chap 3-7 quietly describe Cass' getting worse, souls go wild in vail, has to take Lucifer's advice to release Michael, get Rowena to help, Winchester counseling time for Michael/Lucifer)

<br>

#### draft notes

Cass: With their damaged half-full grace, we may need both of them.

Sam: Or we help them recover, get them on top of their power and then do the rest.

Dean: That's your idea? That's dumbest idea in a pool of dumb idea you've ever come up with.

Dean: it’s like putting two nuclear together and hope they don’t explode! What’s the odds?

They all agree Dean should get nowhere close to Michael and same goes for Sam and Lucifer, so Sam and Rowena go to Michael, Dean and Cass go to Lucifer

M/L counseling session: Do you remember the time when...

M/L deciding not saving angels: There is no darkness without light, so if they're all gone, so is the disease. Problem solved.

### Chapter 9: King's Cross

**(outline: to stop Michael/Lucifer and save Cass/Heaven, Sam/Dean says yes, get dirty, take back control, sacrifice each other, explodes and kills M/L (in heaven), purifies angels in heaven; Cass go to find them, try to save them again, find in King's Cross like in HP, one way to heaven/John/Mary, one way to earth/Cass, choose Cass and back)**

#### draft notes

Michael to Dean: I know it's too easy to give your own life for the angel you care, but are you willing to give your brother's life for him too?

(To save Cass, S/D has to become M/L)

Dean: Sonofabitch, yes! I say, yes!

Cass: Dean, don't!

Dean: I have to, I can't let you die, I just can't.

<br>

The Sam/Dean stabbing happens in heaven, after Michael/Lucifer flies to heaven together. So when they stab, the purification happens only on heaven, explains why Cass is not cured.

<br>

### Chapter 10: The Brightest Light

**(outline: Cass uses up his power, is still dying, angel/Dumah comes to explain+offer Heaven in their command, Dean's soul is the brightest light, Dean can save him but only if he let himself be honest with his feelings, Dean uses his soul to touch Cass and purify/save Cass, don't need to say love but so much more than love, there is no word for them even "love", all HE)**

#### draft notes

Dean: You fixed me so many times, it's my turn now.

<br>

### Epilogue: Inherit the World

**(outline: heaven in their command, earth seems fine, TFW go to beach finally, with matching shirts and toes in the sands like Dean always imagined)**

<br>

### Bonus: Jellyfish

**(explicit content)**

<br>

(Cass is also infected, symptom starts with can't heal, pain, weak (try to hide but found out by Dean))

Dean: Don't tell me you're infected

Cass doesn't answer.

Dean's heart sinks: you are, aren't you? Why don't you tell me?

<br>

Cass is constantly headache, at first they all thought it’s because of angel radio. Every now and then it gets so bad that he has to hold on to something to not fall. His view goes black, from several seconds to minutes. Dean always lend him a shoulder if he’s within range.

Dean watches closely, worried: You want to tune that down a bit, pal?

Cass: I can’t, I won’t. They’re suffering and dying up there, the least I can do is to not forget that.

Dean: Yeah, not like you can ever forget easily.

What he means is *I hate to see you suffer*, but he doesn’t say it.

(The headache is just the first symptom of infection, they just didn’t know yet)
