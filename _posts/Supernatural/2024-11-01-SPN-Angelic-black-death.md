(Note: post-S11 pre-S12 timeline, minus British Men of Letters and Mary. It starts as a one-shot idea, but then get stretched up -- it stretched itself up to full length -- and now becomes practically a S12 rewrite.)

<br>

They're celebrating. Just the three of them in the bunker's kitchen, Sam, Dean, and Cass, with several dozens of beer and a full table of (now almost empty) pizza boxes. But nevertheless, it's a big celebration.

"Finally, finally!" Dean is saying, over a bottle of beer, can't stop beaming, "A big win long overdue, here we go!"

"Yeah I hear you." Sam agrees, a little over himself too, lazily leaning into the seat by the wall, sipping his share of beer. "No God, no Darkness, no angel or demon, no new freaking Apocalypse, no bigger disaster when the old one is barely missed. How long have we ever really get this much peace?"

Cass seriously considers his question. "At least eleven years ago." He answers, with a straight face.

Dean looks up from his bottle, beaming brighter, "Good to have you back, Cass."

Cass meets his eyes and nods, "So are you, Dean. I'm very glad you're okay."

Dean studies his face, and Cass holds his stare -- actually, from where Sam is, it looks like they are just both silently studying each other, looking for tiniest trace of something ominous hidden inside, as if they didn't pretty much spend every second of the last couple hours together.

"How are you really, Cass?" Dean breaks first, voice soft. Judging by how Cass parts his lips and pauses, he was beaten by a millisecond by the same question he was just about to ask Dean.

"I'm fine." Cass says, his smile drops a little, the voice sounds like a silent sigh. He shifts the eyes, turns to take a deep drink of whatever liquor that was in the glass in front of him.

"No post-Devil-possession syndrome?" Dean chases his eyes, "Just, you know, when have things ever been easy for us? I'm just thinking loud, in case there is anything, we might want to give the celebration a rain check."

Cass stares back with slightly widened eyes, "No, there is no such syndrome, and I feel fine."

With that, he narrows his eyes and throws the question back, "What about you? No 'post-Darkness-entanglement-and-soul-bomb' syndrome?"

His fingers did an air quote and Dean finds his eyes automatically get distracted and dropped on his fingers, flickering with amusement. He answers with a shrug and a small grin, "No, nothing, I feel peachy."

"Great! Urgh, that is, great!" Sam cuts in quickly, looking at the watch on his wrist in a very deliberate motion. "Well, it's late, and it's been a hell of a day. Think I'll hit bed now."

Dean hums an acknowledgement, takes another drink slowly, and asks thoughtfully, "Do you think, when the sun was gone and then re-appeared, the time should be reset? Like, it's a new day or something? Hell, it's probably a whole new era when future historians look back."

Sam lets out a short laugh, "Wow, Aristotle, I'll leave you to think about that." He stands up and pats his brother on the shoulder briefly, nods at Cass on his way out, and then disappears outside of the kitchen door.

Dean and Cass look at the direction where Sam took off, taking gulps of drink almost simultaneously, enjoying the comfortable lazy silence between them for a while longer.

After god knows how long, Dean finally decides to put down his drink and glance at his watch, "Guess Sam is right, as much as I'd like to stay, I'm probably too old for the overnight carnival and celebration now. Need to pass out for a couple of hours." He stands up staggeringly, feeling his eyes can barely stay open now, he'll own that to more tiredness than drunkenness.

"I understand." Cass stands up too, follows him out of the kitchen and helps Dean get back to his room before he takes a wrong turn.

"Get some rest, Dean." Cass says, his hands still holding some of Dean's weight before making sure he's secure on his own bed. Then he gestures the other end of the corridor, "I'll just take the guest room."

"Good night, Cass." Dean mumbles, though Cass suspects he might already fell in sleep before finishing the sentence.

Cass turns off the light and stays by the door just a second too long. "Good night, Dean."

<br>

Something is wrong.

Something is always wrong, like they say, with them as Winchesters. But this feels... not really *wrong* wrong, but *off*.

"I don't know how to tell you, Sammy, it's like my hair is in the wrong direction, or... or spider sense gets triggered or something." Dean is a little irritated, hands flying everywhere trying vainly to compensate for the lack of accurate words. "My gut says so, okay? And I know better than ignoring a hunter's intuition. Something is definitely off but I don't know what."

Sam presses his palms on the forehead. They shouldn't have this conversation before they even have their first cup of coffee of the day. This shouldn't be how the second day after saving the universe starts like. But here they are.

"Your gut telling you anything else? A bit more details?" Sam presses the power button on the coffee machine, and turns back to face his brother. "Heaven? Hell? Up? Down? From anywhere? Anyone we can call?"

"It's my gut, Sam," Dean stares at him, "not Google, how the hell would I know?"

Sam sighs, "You sure it's not a post-traumatic stress something? Or a nightmare? Maybe you should just take some more rest. You did only stand up face to face with the full-power Darkness and almost died yesterday after all."

Dean rounds his eyes, his voice on the edge of snapping, "I know what PTSD is, and this ain't that, alright?"

Sam debates whether to point out that Dean didn't handle that well after he came back from Hell or Purgatory no matter how he pretended to be, maybe this is just like those times. But looking at Dean's face, he swallows the thought back. "You talked to Cass about that yet?" is what he decides to go with.

"No..." Dean pauses, looks around, pauses again, and then almost amused, "Did... did he oversleep even later than us?"

Sam spreads his hands.

The next thought coming immediately after hits both of them at the same moment. Dean stiffens and Sam straights up from pouring newly made coffee, they share a tense look.

It can't be good. Angels don't sleep, and the few other times when Cass did sleep, he's either dying of a lack of grace or already became human. Or worse, the no-show could be another quiet leave without goodbye where he decides to do his own things, and that usually doesn't turn out very well.

Dean and Sam rush towards the guest room.

Dean gets there first and starts bumping on the door. "Cass, you in there?" He raises voice over his own pounding noise.

A mumbling voice answers from inside, but sounds a hell lot like moaning. Dean lets out a breath that he doesn't know he was holding, but almost immediately holds it again.

They both tilt head trying to hear better what Cass is saying, but the usually-too-thin door suddenly seems too sound-proof now to catch any sentence.

Dean takes two steps back and lifts one leg, ready to kick his way in, and Sam is right on time to put a hand in front of him to stop, "Whoa, hey, have you tried to turn the door knob?"

Dean gives him a glance, not at all guilty of not thinking straight, "Good idea."

He turns the door knob, and the door opens obediently. Dean deliberately ignores Sam's look on the back of his head.

Cass is in the room, sitting by his clean and clearly not-slept-on bed, hands pressed firmly on the temple, eyes shut tight, looking too concentrated that it looks almost like pain.

Dean dashes inside, holding him around the shoulder, shaking slightly, "Hey, hey Cass, what's wrong? What happened?"

Cass looks like he has to take great effort to put his hands down and set the volume in his head lower before he can even try to start talking.

"It's angel radio." He looks at Dean with a grimace, his face wrinkled with pain, "Something is happening to the angels, they're getting sick and dying fast. From what I can hear, it's contagious and deadly. So much voice, so much agony. I have to go now."

"Wait, wait, hold on a second, Cass, not so fast." Dean presses him back to bed right when he tries to stand up. "Contagious and deadly, you say?"

Cass nods, "Yes, it appears so."

"And you are, what, just gonna walk straight into it?" Dean's eyes are probably literally glaring now, "Like a man walking into a Black Death plague town?"

Cass stares at him, voice starting to get harsh, "Yes! I'm not a man, and I have to know more. Angels are dying, I can't just sit here doing nothing!"

"Well, you can't help if you're dead or sick too." Dean points out, then adds half-jokingly, "Besides, who cares if a few flying monkeys died, it's not like they're so friendly or helpful before. Personally I still feel there are too many of them around, might as well..."

"Dean." Sam warns quietly, and Dean shuts up just in time.

Cass shakes off Dean's hands on his shoulder and stands up, his eyes are almost furious now. Dean can't say he didn't flinch. It reminds him of the very first time seeing Castiel in that barn. Even without his wings, Cass can sometimes still be very terrifying.

"Sorry, didn't mean to..." Dean starts but gets cut off.

Cass grits his teeth, "In case you forget, *I* happen to also be one of the 'flying monkeys'." The air quotes almost get Dean choked on his own suppressed laughter. He has to fight hard to stop the face muscle from twitching.

"They might be ass-butts from time to time, but they are still my brothers and sisters." Castiel says sternly, Dean avoids his glares and can't help but feel a little hurt. Even if he understands, he really does, but still, the word "brother" might just mean differently sometimes.

"So yes, I am going back to Heaven to see what's happening, to save them if I can or die trying." Castiel concludes.

"We'll go with you." Words slip out of Dean's tongue before his brain catches what he's saying.

"Dean, seriously?" Sam says, Dean almost forgets he's still there.

Cass' expression gets slightly softer, "No, you can't, Dean. It will kill you, and you know that. No human can be in Heaven. I have to go alone."

"Or ask the sick ones come to earth?" Dean suggests hopefully, "So you don't have to be around all those coughing sneezing guys."

"Do we know if this angel sickness would pass on to human?" Sam asks.

Cass looks at Sam for the first time after they came into his room. "I don't think so." he says, "Angels technically don't exist in the same dimension as humans, we only manifest into this dimension when we need to. So whatever this is, I don't think it can cross dimension."

"Awesome," Dean loosens up slightly, "good to know humans won't extinct because the flying dudes poke at the wrong place."

"But I don't think they can be moved to Earth or if they'd be willing to." Cass looks back at Dean.

"Why not?"

"Would you be willing to go to a strange new place, like abroad or the Moon, when you're seriously sick or dying?" Cass squints his eyes.

"Fair point." Sam admits while Dean makes a funny little defeated sound with nose.

"So can we all agree now that I need to go? Alone, and immediately?" Cass sighs, getting noticeably more impatient as time passes by.

Sam opens and closes his mouth a few times, looks like he still tries to object but doesn't know what to say. Dean stares at one far end on the ground, eyes unfocused, seems to be deep in thought.

Cass walks towards the door.

"What if," Dean holds out a finger, but still locks his eyes on that spot on the floor, not out of the contemplate, "what if you become human?"

The room falls silent, Dean looks up to two x-ray gazes that are so sharp that he almost can feel the cut on his skin. He shifts his feet, "Hear me out, you said humans can't get infected by this angelic black death, right? And you had been back to Heaven before even without or with little of your grace. So if we can somehow drain your grace to almost like a human, you go there, poke around, solve the problem, and come back juicing up again, voila, problem solved."

"Dean," Sam sighs, "I don't even want to start on how many things can go wrong there."

"I'm not saying I like it." Dean eyes him, then focuses back on the only angel in the room, "Hell, I even hate myself for saying that, God knows how difficult it is every time see you lose your mojo, but it's still better than being sick and dead, a thousand times better."

Castiel considers.

Dean studies him.

Sam studies them both. Like how things have always been between them.

"So?" Dean asks hopefully, "Would it work?"

"Probably." Cass says solemnly and slowly. The way he tilts his head, it looks like he's half thinking, half tuning back to the angel radio again.

"Great." Dean says cheerfully, gestures to his brother and mouths "See, I'm a genius." Sam snorts with a light curl on the edge of the lip.

"So, what do we need?" Sam asks.

"Nothing we don't already have in the bunker." Cass heads towards one of the stock rooms by the library, Sam and Dean follow him closely.

<br>

Cass rummages through the drawers in the stock room, making all kinds of noises as random items get moved around, as Sam and Dean stand not too far away behind, not sure how to help.

"There." Cass grabs a wooden box out of the top drawer, taking it back to the library table.

Inside the box, there is a syringe and a flask. The wooden brown cover of the flask has some markings on it, showing it might be unusual or maybe magical, while the syringe looks just ordinary enough to blend in any hospital.

"That's it?" Dean eyes it curiously, somewhat expecting something more fancy.

"Yes." Cass hands him both items, "You can use that to extract my life force and store them in the flask. I expect you may need to repeat the process a few times before I'm drained."

Dean swallows, he doesn't like how the word "drained" sounds like, not at all.

"You sure it's safe?" Dean takes the two things from him, feeling uneasy.

"No," Castiel answers in a low but steady voice, "but as you say, we may not have another way. I would hope we can execute the process near the gate, so I don't need to stay in the feeble state for longer time than necessary."

Dean pulls a cheerless smile, "Don't use the word 'execute', will you, buddy? Now I feel like an executioner."

Sam clears his throat behind them.

Dean turns to the garage. "I'll get Baby ready in five."

<br>

The gate is not guarded by any angel. The whole park is totally empty, no sign of any human or angel. Considering most of the angels are busy tendering their new disease outburst, it's more or less expected.

Dean still frowns at the place. He never likes this place, after the angels make the playground a Heaven elevator portal, nothing good ever happened every time anyone is near here.

The air in the Impala goes quiet for a few minutes, looking like all three of them fall into their own thoughts, before Dean breaks the silence.

"You ready?" He turns to Cass in the back seat.

"Just do it." Castiel answers gravely.

There is not much space in the Impala to make it a comfortable surgery table, so they have to make do. Castiel leans back on the back seat next to the door with his eyes closed, Dean holds the syringe tight and close to his skin near the neck, and Sam holds the flask besides him, looking at them with his worried eyes.

Dean swallows, eyes moving between Castiel's closed eyes and vulnerable bare skin by the throat, remembering this is how every time he got his throat cut and grace taken, now he's trusting him to do the exact same worst thing to himself. Dean has to use his left hand to steady the right hand that holds the syringe, like holding a gun for the first time.

Dean clenches his teeth, and finally pushes out for an inch. It turns out, it is fairly easy to stab a syringe inside someone's neck and start extracting -- or maybe it's just the angel biology that's different from human vessel. Bright glowing light starts flowing into the syringe, Dean can't help stare at the beautiful light in there, and then notices Cass grits his teeth tight with deep lines between his brows. His breath catches pace too, becoming deeper and quicker, like he's enduring large amount of pain.

Dean stops immediately, the syringe is already filled with the grace. He takes the needle out of Cass, putting a hand on his shoulder, asking eagerly, "How are you feeling?"

"Continue." Cass answers between his gritted teeth.

Dean sighs, pushes the tube into the flask, and starts extracting the second time again. And then the third.

Cass looks worse and worse, sweat starting to rolling down from his forehead, his body sliding down weakly on the seat.

"Okay I don't think we should..." Dean frowns deeply and ready to give up on this terrible plan, Cass is just looking awful.

Castiel grabs his wrist to prevent him from taking the needle out. "Keep. Going." His voice hoarse and husky.

"Tell me I'm not killing you." Dean growls.

"You are not." Cass has to catch a breath after every few words, "You're doing the right thing." His eyes are still closed tight, probably to hold back the pain, Dean thinks.

"Yeah sometimes the right thing sucks." Dean barks, "Tell me when to stop."

He can see the light in the syringe is already noticeably getting thinner, like he can almost vividly see the mojo tank inside Cass is getting lower as he extracts.

"Almost there." Cass holds both hands on the edge of the seat to prevent himself from further sliding down, but even his fingers are too weak now as a almost-human. His knuckles are white, and more sweat pouring down.

Dean sees it all. "Okay we'll call it a day." He decides, taking the syringe away and handing to Sam, like he can't bare to hold the damn thing one more second, like it's a criminal evidence that he's hurting Castiel.

Cass breathes heavily, his chest rising up and down with rhythms of a sea wave. Dean feels as shitty.

"Ready to take a walk?" He tries to use a light joking tone but fails, the concern and worry leak from his eyes into his voice.

Cass finally opens his eyes and looks back. Dean thinks even the blue in his eyes fades somewhat with the lack of grace, but maybe it's just the effect of the light.

Cass tries to climb out of the impala on his own but staggers, Dean lends his shoulder to help and lead him to the gate.

"Think you'll be alright going upstairs and coming back?" Dean hesitates to leave when Cass steps onto the sand.

Cass gives him a nod. "I'll be back as soon as possible." He says, and the portal lights up. The sand rises like a mini-sandstorm, and when it settles down again, Castiel is no longer there.

<br>

Dean walks back to the impala, bending over the top, frowning so hard into the deep space as if he can use the bare stare to tear open the air and get himself into Heaven to help.

"Urgh," Sam starts and pauses, "you want to find a place to rest? He can take days you know, in case you're thinking about waiting here all the time."

"I'm not leaving until he's back." Dean snaps, way too harshly than necessary, "You see how he is just now, he'll need us when he comes back." He thinks and adds, "And he might come back anytime."

"Right," Sam lets out a light sounds that almost like a chuckle, "that's what I thought."

They wait and wait. Sam leaves temporarily on the second day to grab some food and comes back find Dean sitting on the bench near the sandbox, never leaves his eyes from the portal, like he's afraid he might miss the angel if he even blinks.

"We can take turn watching." Sam offers, handing his brother a burger with extra cheese.

Dean bites his food half-heartedly and doesn't answer. But by the next day, the exhaustion wins the silent debate.

"Wake me up if anything happens. Anything." Dean says, warningly.

"Yes, yes. Now go." Sam rolls his eyes.

Dean lies down on the back seat of the impala and immediately falls asleep.

Dreams never serve him well. The dreams about the Pit that butchers him, the Cage that swallows his brother, the glowing light that turns his best friend into some thing worse, the monster land that keeps his hair always on ends, and then more. Everything he experienced, everyone he lost, the dreams always seem to find a way to dig the old memory back up and remind him how fresh they still are.

He rolls uneasily on the back seat, still not wake up yet.

He is walking into a small middle-age-looking village. The houses are shabby, the road is dirty and stained. The whole vision looks bleak, like cutting out from a black-and-white silent movie from 20s. There is no color, no sound. That is why he thought the stains on the road are just dirt, or maybe just what's left of horseshit, if it's an age with horse cart.

But then he sees them, the bodies. Piles of piles of bodies down the road, in front of the house, down the ditch, by the road. The stains are not smudge, they are blood, too much blood, from these dead bodies. All the bodies have deadly black spots on the face and bare skins, all have a horror expression left on the face long after they can feel anything anymore. All have black charred wings behind their backs.

This is an angel black death town, with no survivors. Dean realizes, horrifiedly. He walks down the road, doesn't really want to look at any of the body or their faces, but the image is right in front of him, they're everywhere. They just look so... human. Dean feels his heart knot with apprehension.

He continues walking down the road, not sure what he's looking for or how this will end. Until he finds someone sitting by the corner of a wall, still moving, though barely. He runs to him, kneeling down, and recognizes this is Cass. Except, the body almost looks nothing like Cass, it's all covered with black spots and continue spreading, his eyes shadowed with dark fog, his mouth and nose oozing with black goo. He's dying, and Dean can do nothing to save him.

"Cass? Cass!" Dean yells. He doesn't dare to touch him, in case it causes him more pain. His hands reach out to his shoulder tentatively, but take back before contact. All he can do is just keeping calling his dying best friend's name.

Castiel hears him. His swollen eyes somehow manage to look through the shadow and look into his.

"Dean?" He sounds unsure, Dean's heart clenched with pain, "Is that really you?"

"Yeah Cass, it's me." Dean uses his softest voice, "I got you."

"You come." Castiel's face twitches, and Dean realizes he tries to smile but there is not even enough muscle to pull it, he feels his heart is being cut and sliced by the sharpest surgical knife. "You come for me."

"Of course I do." Dean manages to answer, "You're family."

"Then why, are you coming so late?" Castiel's eyes suddenly become fierce, filled with anger and accuse and pain, "They're all dead! All of them. And now it's my turn. Where were you when we need you? Why can't you come earlier? Why can't you save us?"

Castiel suddenly straightens up his body, reaching out and grabbing him on the collar, shouting at his face, "We are all dead! I'm dead! Because of you!" Dean can't look at his eyes, but can't take away. He shudders.

"Dean! Dean!" Sam's voice pierces through the veil of dreamland, Dean gasps awake, almost like a drowning man fighting for air.

Sam is shaking his shoulder, looking more concerned than he already was when Cass walked into the portal.

Dean blinks at his face blankly, trying to catch up on the reality, half of his mind still stuck in the middle age town he left seconds ago.

"You okay?" Sam asks, hands leaving his shoulder the moment he sits up, "Bad dream?"

Dean rubs his neck and waist, "Yeah," he says, "not the best place to spend the night, you know."

Sam examines him, really wants to point out impala seat usually wouldn't make a person scream in his dream, but ends up biting his tongues because he knows far too well Dean wouldn't say a thing.

"Any news?" Dean walks out of the car, still rubbing his back. It's not completely a lie that sleeping in the car is doing terrible thing to his almost-forty-year-old spine.

"Nothing changed." Sam says.

Dean hums, and sits back on the bench by the Heaven's gate, silently taking the watch again.

<br>

Cass comes back at the night of the fourth day.

And he lands clumsily.

<br>

<br>

(Draft:

Dean (growl): You know this is gonna kill you and you did it anyway?

Cass (weakly): No. (stare) Yes? Maybe? I don't know how bad it will be, alright? I just saw there might be a shot and I took it.

Dean (worried, annoyed): Okay new rule, from now on, every time you need to make a move, tell us everything you know, capiche? Man, we should have this rule like forever ago.

Cass (widened eyes, grumble): I capiche.

Dean: Good, now back to square one.

<br>

Dean: We don't know jack squat about the angel biology, how are we gonna play doctor?

Sam: How about we stick to the basics, work with what we know, do the research, just like it's just another case?

Dean: A case, fan-freaking-tastic. Do you remember our job used to be beheading vampires? Not babysitting or feeding them with soup when they get sick? (hold a hand) Don't give me the look, tell me you don't think angels are just monsters with good PR.

Sam (sighs): I don't like them more than you do, I mean, obviously except Cass. But that doesn't mean I want them all dead, who knows what will happen if Heaven runs out of angels. I'd rather help them out once, instead of dealing with billions of spirits in vail if Heaven is on lock down. So yeah, I'm fine with this. And maybe, if they own us one, next time they show up, we won't have to kill each other.

Dean (grumble): I'd hope they never show up again. But okay, points taken. Where do we start?

Sam: Start with what we know, about Cass.

Dean (frown): First of all, he's probably the least typical of an angel by now, with all the resurrection -- not that I complain -- and hanging around on earth with us all this time. And B, what are you gonna do about him? Anatomy? He's not a guinea pig for you to learn biology in college class. He's Cass.

Sam (roll eyes): I know that, of course I know. I just mean, research. (gesture to books) So will you just shut up and start reading, please?

Dean: Super. I'll grab some beer first.

<br>

Sam: I find something! Hmm, maybe.

Dean: Aren't you a scholarship boy. What do we have?
