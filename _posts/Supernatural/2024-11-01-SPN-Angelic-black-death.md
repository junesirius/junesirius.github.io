### Chapter 1: Here We Go, Again

They're celebrating. Just the three of them in the bunker's kitchen, Sam, Dean, and Cass, with several dozens of beer and a full table of (now almost empty) pizza boxes. But nevertheless, it's a big celebration.

"Finally, finally!" Dean is saying, over a bottle of beer, can't stop beaming, "A big win long overdue, here we go!"

"Yeah I hear you." Sam agrees, a little over himself too, lazily leaning into the seat by the wall, sipping his share of beer. "No God, no Darkness, no angel or demon, no new freaking Apocalypse, no bigger disaster when the old one is barely missed. How long have we ever really get this much peace?"

Cass seriously considers his question. "At least eleven years ago." He answers, with a straight face.

Dean looks up from his bottle, beaming brighter, "Good to have you back, Cass."

Cass meets his eyes and nods, "So are you, Dean. I'm very glad you're okay."

Dean studies his face, and Cass holds his stare -- actually, from where Sam is, it looks like they are just both silently researching each other, microscoping and dissecting, looking for tiniest trace of something ominous hidden inside, as if they didn't pretty much spend every second of the last couple hours together.

"How are you really, Cass?" Dean breaks first, voice soft. Judging by how Cass parts his lips and pauses, he was beaten by a millisecond by the same question he was just about to ask Dean.

"I'm fine." Cass says, his smile drops a little, the voice sounds like a silent sigh. He shifts the eyes, turns to take a deep drink of whatever liquor that was in the glass in front of him.

"No post-Devil-possession syndrome?" Dean chases his eyes, "Just, you know, when have things ever been easy for us? I'm just thinking loud, in case there is anything, we might want to give the celebration a rain check."

Cass stares back with slightly widened eyes, "No, there is no such syndrome, and I feel fine."

With that, he narrows his eyes and throws the question back, "What about you? No 'post-Darkness-entanglement-and-soul-bomb' syndrome?"

His fingers did an air quote and Dean finds his eyes automatically get distracted and dropped on his fingers, flickering with amusement. He answers with a shrug and a small grin, "Nope, nothing, all peachy."

"Great! Uh, that is, great!" Sam cuts in quickly, looking at the watch on his wrist in a very deliberate motion. "Well, it's late, and it's been a hell of a day. Think I'll hit bed now."

Dean hums an acknowledgement, takes another drink slowly, and asks thoughtfully, "Do you think, with the sun gone and back, the time should be reset? Like, it's a new day or something? Hell, it's probably a whole new era when future historians look back. We got a BC/AD split two thousand years ago, about time for another one. What should we call it? BD/AG, Before-Darkness and After-God era?"

Sam lets out a short laugh, "Wow, Aristotle, I'll leave you to think about that." He stands up and pats his brother on the shoulder briefly, nods at Cass on his way out, and then disappears outside of the kitchen door.

Dean and Cass look at the direction where Sam took off, taking gulps of drink almost simultaneously, enjoying the comfortable lazy silence between them for a while longer.

After god knows how long, Dean finally decides to put down his drink and glance at his watch, "Guess Sam is right, as much as I'd like to stay, I'm probably too old for the overnight carnival and celebration now. Need to pass out for a couple hours." He stands up staggeringly, feeling his eyes can barely stay open now, he'll own that to more tiredness than drunkenness.

"I understand." Cass stands up too, follows him out of the kitchen and helps Dean get back to his room before his crooked footsteps take any wrong turn.

"Get some rest, Dean." Cass says, his hands holding some of Dean's weight until making sure he's secure on his own bed. Then he gestures the other end of the corridor, "I'll just take the guest room."

"Good night, Cass." Dean mumbles, though Castiel suspects he might already fell in sleep before finishing the sentence.

Cass turns off the light, lingering by the door in the dark for two seconds too long. "Good night, Dean."

<br>

Something is wrong.

Something is always wrong, as they often say, with them being Winchesters. But this feels... not really *wrong* wrong, but *off*.

"I don't know how to tell you, Sammy, it's like my hair is in the wrong direction, or... or spider sense gets triggered or something." Dean is a little irritated, hands flying everywhere trying vainly to compensate for the lack of accurate words. "My gut says so, okay? And I know better than ignoring a hunter's intuition. Something is definitely off but I don't know what."

Sam presses his palms on the forehead. They shouldn't have this conversation before they even have their first cup of coffee of the day. And this definitely shouldn't be how the second day after saving the universe starts. But here they are.

"Your gut telling you anything else? A bit more details?" Sam presses the power button on the coffee machine, and turns back to face his brother. "Heaven? Hell? Up? Down? From anywhere? Anyone we can call?"

"It's my gut, Sam," Dean stares at him, "not Google, how the hell would I know?"

Sam sighs, "You sure it's not a post-traumatic stress something? Or a nightmare? Maybe you should just take some more rest. You did only stand up face to face with the full-power Darkness and almost died yesterday after all."

Dean rounds his eyes, his voice on the edge of snapping, "I know what PTSD is, and this ain't that, alright?"

Sam debates whether to point out that Dean didn't handle that well after he came back from Hell or Purgatory no matter how he pretended to be, maybe this is just like those times. But judging by Dean's face, he swallows the thought back. "You talked to Cass about that yet?" is what he decides to go with.

"No..." Dean pauses, looks around, pauses again, and then almost amused, "Did... did he oversleep even later than us?"

Sam throws up his hands to mean "I have no idea".

The next thought coming immediately after hits both of them at the same moment. Dean stiffens and Sam straights up from pouring newly made coffee, they share a tense look.

It can't be good. Angels don't sleep, and the few other times when Cass did sleep, he's either dying of a lack of grace or already became human. Or worse, the no-show could be another quiet leave without goodbye where he decides to do his own things, and that usually doesn't turn out very well.

Dean and Sam rush towards the guest room.

Dean gets there first and starts bumping on the door. "Cass, you in there?" He raises voice over his own pounding noise.

A mumbling voice answers from inside, but sounds a hell lot like moaning. Dean lets out a breath that he doesn't know he was holding, but almost immediately holds it again.

They both tilt head trying to hear better what Cass is saying, but the door that usually is too thin to hold anything back suddenly seems too sound-proof now to catch any sentence.

Dean takes two steps back and lifts one leg, ready to kick his way in, and Sam is right on time to put a hand in front of him to stop, "Whoa, hey, have you tried to maybe turn the door knob?"

Dean gives him a glance, not at all guilty of not thinking straight, "Good idea."

He turns the door knob, and the door opens obediently. Dean deliberately ignores Sam's look on the back of his head.

Cass is in the room, sitting by his clean and clearly not-slept-on bed, hands pressed firmly on the temple, eyes shut tight, looking too concentrated that it looks very close to pain.

Dean dashes inside, holding him around the shoulder, shaking slightly, "Hey, hey Cass, what's wrong? What happened?"

Cass looks like he has to take great effort to put his hands down and set the volume in his head lower before he can even try to start talking.

"It's angel radio." He looks at Dean with a grimace, his face wrinkled with pain, "Something is happening to the angels, they're getting sick and dying fast. From what I can hear, it's contagious and deadly. So much voice, so much agony. I have to go now."

"Wait, wait, hold on a sec, Cass, not so fast." Dean presses him back to bed right when he tries to stand up. "Contagious and deadly, you say?"

Cass nods, "Yes, it appears so."

"And you are, what, just gonna walk straight into it?" Dean's eyes are probably literally glaring now, "Like a man walking into a Black Death plague town?"

Cass stares at him, voice starting to get harsh, "Yes! I'm not a man, and I have to know more. Angels are dying, I can't just sit here doing nothing!"

"Well, you can't help if you're dead or sick too." Dean points out, then adds half-jokingly, "Besides, who cares if a few flying monkeys died, not like they're so friendly or helpful in the past. Hell, personally I still think there are too many of them around, might as well..."

"Dean." Sam warns quietly, and Dean shuts up just in time.

Cass shakes off Dean's hands from his shoulder and stands up, his eyes are furious now, and maybe also a little something like hurt. Dean can't say he didn't flinch. It reminds him so much of the very first time seeing Castiel in that barn. Even without his wings, Cass can sometimes still be very intimidating, terrifying even.

"Sorry, didn't mean to..." Dean starts but gets cut off.

Cass grits his teeth, "In case you forget, *I* happen to also be one of the 'flying monkeys'." The air quotes almost get Dean choked on his own unintended laughter. He has to fight hard to stop the face muscle from twitching.

"They might be ass-butts from time to time, but they are still my brothers and sisters." Castiel says sternly, Dean avoids his glares and can't help but feel hurt. Even if he understands, he really does, but still, the word "brother" might just mean differently sometimes.

"So yes, I am going back to Heaven to see what's happening, to save them if I can. Or die trying." Castiel concludes.

"We'll go with you." Words slip out of Dean's tongue before his brain catches what he's saying.

"Dean, you sure?" Sam voices, Dean almost forgets he's still there.

Cass' expression gets slightly softer, "No, you can't, Dean. It will kill you, and you know that. No human can be in Heaven. I have to go alone."

"Or ask the sick ones come down here?" Dean suggests hopefully, "So you don't have to be around all those coughing sneezing guys."

"Cass, do we know if this angel sickness can pass on to human?" Sam asks cautiously.

Cass looks at Sam for the first time after they burst into his room. "I don't think so." he says, "Angels technically don't exist in the same dimension as humans, we only manifest into this dimension when we need to. So whatever this is, I don't think it can cross dimension."

"Awesome," Dean's whole body loosens up slightly, "good to know humans won't extinct because the flying dudes poke at the wrong place."

"But I don't think they can be moved to Earth or if they'd be willing to." Cass looks back at Dean again.

"Why not?"

"Would you be willing to go to a strange new place, like abroad or the Moon, when you're seriously sick and dying?" Cass squints his eyes.

"Fair point." Sam admits while Dean makes a funny little defeated sound with nose.

"So can we all agree now that I need to go? Alone, and immediately?" Cass sighs, getting noticeably more impatient as time passes by.

Sam opens and closes his mouth a few times, looks like he still tries to object but doesn't know what to say. Dean stares at one far end on the ground, eyes unfocused, seems to be deep in thought.

Cass walks towards the door.

"What if," Dean holds out a finger, but still locks his eyes on that spot on the floor, not out of the contemplate, "what if you become human?"

The room falls silent, Dean looks up to meet two x-ray gazes that are so sharp that he almost can feel the cut on his skin. He shifts his feet uncomfortably. "Hear me out, you said humans can't get infected by this angelic black death, right? And you had been back to Heaven before even without or with little of your grace. So what if we somehow drain your grace to *almost* like a human, keep it safe, you go there, poke around, solve the problem, and come back juicing up again, voila, problem solved."

"Dean," Sam sighs, "I don't even want to start on how many things can go wrong there."

"I'm not saying I like it." Dean eyes him, then focuses back on the only angel in the room, "Hell, even *I* hate myself for saying that, God knows how tough it is every time see you lose your mojo, but it's still better than being sick or dead, a thousand times better."

Castiel considers.

Dean studies him and waits.

Sam studies them both. Like how things have always been between them.

"So?" Dean asks hopefully, "Would it work?"

"Probably." Cass says solemnly and slowly. The way he tilts his head, it looks like he's half thinking, half tuning back to the angel radio again.

"Great." Dean says cheerfully, gestures to his brother and mouths a silent "See? I'm a genius." Sam snorts with a light curl on the edge of the lip.

"So what do we need?" Sam asks.

"Nothing we don't already have in the bunker." Cass heads towards one of the stock rooms by the library, Sam and Dean follow him closely.

<br>

Cass rummages through the drawers in the stock room, making all kinds of noises as random items get moved around.

"There." After a few minutes, Cass fetches a wooden box out of the top drawer, taking it back to the library table.

Inside the box, there is a syringe and a flask. The wooden brown cover of the flask has some mysterious illegible markings and patterns on it, so it might be somewhat unusual or magical, while the syringe looks just ordinary enough to blend in any hospital.

"That's it?" Dean eyes them curiously, somehow expecting something fancier.

"Yes." Cass hands him both items, "You can use that to extract my life force and store them in the flask. I expect you may need to repeat the process a few times before I'm drained."

Dean swallows, he doesn't like how the word "drained" sounds like, not at all.

"You sure it's safe?" Dean takes the two things from him, feeling uneasy.

"No," Castiel answers in a low but steady voice, "but as you say, we may not have a better option. I would hope we can execute the process near the gate, so I don't need to stay in the feeble state for longer time than necessary."

Dean pulls a cheerless smile, "Don't use the word 'execute', will you, buddy? Now I feel like an executioner."

Sam clears his throat behind them to remind the timing.

Dean turns to the garage. "I'll get Baby ready in five."

<br>

The gate is not guarded by any angel. The whole playground is totally empty, no sign of any human or angel. Considering most of the angels are busy tendering their new disease outburst, it's more or less expected.

Dean still frowns at the place. He never likes this place, after the angels make the playground a Heaven elevator portal, nothing good ever happened every time anyone is near here.

The air in the Impala goes quiet for a few minutes after the car parks, all three of them fell into their own thoughts, before Dean breaks the silence. "You ready?" He turns to Cass in the back seat.

"Just do it." Castiel answers gravely.

There is not much space in the Impala to make it a comfortable surgery table, so they have to make do. Castiel leans back on the back seat next to the door with his eyes closed, Dean holds the syringe tight and close to his skin near the neck, and Sam holds the flask besides him, looking at them with his worried eyes.

Dean swallows, eyes wandering around Castiel's vulnerable bare skin by the throat, remembering this is exactly how every time he got his throat cut and grace taken, now he's trusting him to do the exact same worst thing to himself. Dean has to use his left hand to steady the right one, like holding a gun for the first time.

Dean takes another breath, and finally pushes out for the last inch. It turns out that it is fairly easy to stab a needle inside someone's neck and start extracting -- or maybe it's just that the angel biology being different from human. Bright glowing light starts flowing into the syringe, Dean can't help stare at the beautiful light in there, his eyes uncontrollably get caught by the color and brightness of the light, his heart bumps with a sudden knowledge that to some extent, he might be looking at Cass' true form now, no matter how small the portion is.

When he tears his eyes away, Dean notices Cass clenches his teeth tight with deep lines between his brows. His breath catches pace too, getting deeper and quicker, like he's enduring huge pain.

Dean stops immediately, the syringe is already filled with grace. He takes the needle out of Cass, asking eagerly with a hand landed on angel's shoulder, "How you feeling?"

"Continue." Cass breathes out the single word between his gritted teeth.

Dean sighs, pushes the tube into the flask, and starts extracting the second time. And then the third.

Cass looks worse by each minute, sweat rolling down from his forehead, his body sliding down weakly on the seat.

"Okay I don't think we should..." Dean frowns deeply and ready to give up on this terrible plan, Cass is just looking awful.

Castiel grabs his wrist to prevent him from taking the needle out. "Keep. Going." His voice hoarse and husky.

"Tell me I'm not killing you." Dean growls at him.

"You are not." Cass has to catch a breath between every few words, "You're doing the right thing." His eyes are still closed tight, probably to hold back the pain, Dean thinks.

"Yeah sometimes the right thing sucks." Dean barks, "Tell me when to stop."

He can see the light in the syringe is already getting noticeably thinner, he can almost vividly imagine the mojo tank inside Cass getting lower as he drains.

"Almost there." Cass holds both hands on the edge of the seat to prevent himself from further sliding down, but even his fingers are too weak now to really do anything. His knuckles are white, more sweat pouring down.

Dean sees it all. "Okay we'll call it a day." He decides, gives up waiting for Cass' signal, taking the syringe away and handing to Sam, like he can't bear to hold the damn thing one more second, like it's a criminal evidence that he's hurting Cass.

Cass breathes heavily, his chest rising up and down with rhythms of a tide. Dean feels just as shitty and can't stop beating himself in his mind.

"Ready to take a walk?" He means to use a light joking tone but fails, the concern and worry leaking from his eyes into his voice.

Cass finally opens his eyes and looks back. Dean thinks even the blue in his eyes fades somewhat with the lack of grace, but maybe it's just the effect of the light.

Cass tries to climb out of the Impala on his own but staggers, Dean lends his shoulder to help and hold him to the gate.

"Think you'll be alright going upstairs and coming back by yourself?" Dean hesitates by the edge when Cass steps onto the sand.

Cass gives him a weak nod. "I'll be back as soon as possible." He says, and then the portal lights up.

Sands rise and spin like a mini-sandstorm. Cass lets out a moan that sounds far too close to a suppressed silent scream, as if he is being burnt alive or torn apart by horses running different directions but uses all his power to swallow back that pain so that Dean might miss it. But Dean didn't. Dean yells his name, can't help himself from instantly reaching out a hand and almost stepping on to the sand, trying to drag Cass back down.

"No, Dean! Don't!" Real panic echoes in Cass' voice.

Dean feels their fingers might have touched for a split second, but immediately there is a force throwing him out. He stumbles back a few steps, by the time he re-steadies himself, the sandstorm has settled down, and Castiel is no longer there.

<br>

### Chapter 2: Heaven on Edge

Dean walks back to the Impala with a gloomy face, bending over the top with fingers folded, frowning so hard into the deep space as if he can use the bare stare to tear open the air and squeeze himself into Heaven to help.

"Uh," Sam clears his throat to get his attention, "you want to find a place to rest? He can take days, you know, in case you're thinking about waiting here all the time."

"I'm not leaving until he's back." Dean reacts instinctively like a knee-jerk reflex, his voice way too harsh than necessary. "You see the state he's in just now, he'll need us when he comes back." He thinks and adds, "And he might come back anytime."

"Right." Sam lets out a light sound that's almost like a chuckle if not counting the deep worry, "That's what I thought."

They wait in silence.

The sun sets down quickly. Dean doesn't move an inch.

Sam asks quietly, "Is this how things like when you guys were in the Purgatory?"

Dean tilts his head towards him, eyes him a question.

"You know, the whole 'not leaving without him' thing." Sam adds, and then quickly shakes his head, "Sorry, didn't mean to bring it up, you probably still don't want to talk about it."

"Yes." Dean suddenly unlocks, much to Sam's surprise.

"Exactly like Purgatory." he continues, "Even more so at the time of leaving. It's like..." he trails off, getting lost in his memory. The image of Cass grabbing his hands and then slipping back into the monster land is still too vivid, still burns his eyes hot. Even after Cass told him the truth, this is still the memory that hit him more than it should.

"Like what?" Sam's voice brings his mind back.

"Like I can never grab anyone's hand hard enough to pull them out of misery, to really save them. They're just, always, slipping from the hold. Taken away. Lost." Dean's voice cracks, his eyes reflected with lights. "All the time."

"Dean." Sam sighs, putting a hand on his brother's shoulder briefly, "Cass will come back, he promised. He always come back to us, to you."

Dean gives him an appreciated weak nod. "He better does." he says huskily, "Otherwise I'll go find him myself and kick his ass."

Sam lets out a short laugh.

The air feels more breathable now.

<br>

They wait and wait. Night turns to day, Sam leaves temporarily on the second day to grab some food and comes back finding Dean sitting on the bench closest to the sand, never leaves his eyes from the portal, as if he's afraid he might miss the angel if he even blinks.

"We can take turn watching." Sam offers, handing his brother a wrapped burger with extra cheese.

Dean bites the food absent-mindedly and doesn't answer. But by the night of the next day, the exhaustion wins the silent argument.

"Wake me up if anything happens. Anything." Dean emphasizes, warningly.

"Yes, yes, Jeez." Sam rolls his eyes, "Now go."

Dean lies down on the back seat of the Impala and immediately falls asleep.

Dreams never serve him well. The dreams about the Pit that butchers him, the Cage that swallows his brother, the glowing light that turns his best friend into something worse, the monster land that keeps his hair always on ends, and then more. Everything he experienced, everyone he lost, he might be able to shove things to the back of the head when his mind is clear, but the dreams always seem to be able to find a way to dig the old memories back up and remind him how fresh the wounds still are.

He rolls uneasily on the back seat, still not wake up yet.

He is walking into a small middle-age-looking village. The houses are shabby, the road is dirty and stained. The whole vision looks bleak, like cutting out from a black-and-white silent movie from 20s. There is no color, no sound, no life. The stains on the road look just like dirt, or maybe what's left of horseshit, if it's an age with horse cart. He doesn't give anything much attention, just keeps walking, has a vague urgent feeling that he is doing something, that he needs to go somewhere fast, that he needs to find something -- or someone -- fast.

And then he sees them, the bodies. Piles of piles of bodies down the road, in front of the houses, down the ditches, by the road. The stains are not smudge, he realizes, they are blood, too much blood, dripping thickly from these dead bodies, flowing and forming into a stream, and then river. All the bodies have deadly black spots on the face and bare skins, all have a horror expression ghosting on the face long after they can feel anything anymore. All have black charred wings behind their backs.

This is an angel black death town, with no survivors. Dean realizes, horrifiedly. He walks down the road, doesn't really want to look at any of the bodies or their faces, but the image is right in front of him, they're everywhere. They just look so... human. Dean feels his heart knot with apprehension.

He continues walking down the road, not sure what he's looking for or where the feet are leading him to. Until he finds someone sitting by the corner of a wall, still moving, though barely. He runs to him, kneeling down, and recognizes this is Cass. Except, the body almost looks nothing like Cass. It's all covered with black spots that continue spreading, his eyes shadowed with dark fog, his mouth and nose oozing with black goo. He's dying, and Dean can do nothing to save him.

"Cass? Cass!" Dean yells. He doesn't dare to touch him, in case it causes him more pain. His hands reach out to his shoulder tentatively, hovers, but takes back hesitantly moments later without contact. All he can do is just keeping calling his dying best friend's name.

Castiel hears him. His swollen eyes somehow manage to look through the shadow and look into his.

"Dean?" He sounds unsure, Dean's heart is clenched with pain, "Is that really you?"

"Yeah Cass, it's me." Dean uses his softest voice, "I got you."

"You come." Castiel's face twitches, and Dean realizes he tries to smile but there is not even enough muscle to pull it, he feels his heart is being cut and sliced by the sharpest surgical knife. "You come for me."

"Of course I do." Dean manages to squeeze his sound through the lump in his throat, "You're family."

"Then why, are you coming so late?" Castiel's eyes suddenly become fierce, filled with anger and accuse and pain, "They're all dead! All of them. And now it's my turn. Where were you when we need you? Why can't you come earlier? Why can't you save us?"

Castiel suddenly straightens up his body, reaching out and grabbing him by the collar, cursing to his face, "We are all dead! I'm dead! Because of you!" Dean can't look at his eyes, but also can't take away. He shudders.

"Dean! Dean!" Sam's voice pierces through the veil of dreamland, Dean gasps awake, breathing heavily like a drowning man fighting for air.

Sam is shaking his shoulder, looking more concerned than he already was when Cass walked into the portal.

Dean blinks at his face blankly, shadows of Cass' face overlapping with Sam's, his brain is trying to catch up on the reality while half of his mind still stuck in the medieval town he left seconds ago.

"You okay?" Sam asks, hands leaving his shoulder the moment he sits up, "Bad dream?"

Dean rubs his neck and waist, "Yeah," he says, "not the best place to spend the night, you know."

Sam examines him, really wants to point out that Impala seats usually don't make a person scream angel's name in his dream, but ends up biting his tongue because he knows far too well Dean wouldn't say a thing.

"Any news?" Dean walks out of the car, still rubbing his back. The night is a little chilly. It's not entirely a lie that sleeping in the car is doing terrible things to his almost-forty-year-old spine.

"Nothing changed." Sam says, "Not even the smallest sand moved."

Dean hums, and sits back on the bench by the Heaven's gate, silently taking the watch again.

<br>

Cass comes back at the night of the fourth day.

And he lands clumsily, as if he's shoved down the portal, falling all the way down from the sky and crashing on the ground. Lucky that the sand looks soft enough for the landing that he doesn't break bones, but his body still makes quite a big thump sound.

Dean and Sam jump to their feet and rush to the messy human figure covered by the crumpled beige trench coat.

"Cass?" Dean gets there first, carefully sets a foot on the sand and puts a hand on his back.

Cass moans weakly, it sounds like even the moaning itself is giving him more pain. His face touches the ground, buried beneath the trench coat like the most of his body. Dean carefully gets the coat out of the way.

Cass is bleeding, blood dripping out of his mouth and corners of his eyes. Cuts and slices are everywhere on his cheeks and any bare skin. His lips are pale white. The shirt is bloody too but Dean can't spare another second to examine. Cass is closing his eyes slowly, like the eyelids are too heavy and he's just too tired and wants nothing but to fall into sleep. There is only some last remnant of sparkling blue left in his pupils, which is going out rapidly like a light bulb with switch turned off.

"Hey, hey! Stay with me, Cass, you hear me?" Dean palms his cheeks gently, feeling his hands quickly covered with sticky blood. The air smells rusty.

"Sammy!" Dean's voice is packed with trembling fear. "Flask!"

The warm wooden flask is slammed into his hands with lid taken off.

Dean puts a hand beneath Cass' head, posturing his head up a little and holding the opening of the flask right in front of his mouth.

"Come on, buddy." He murmurs, close to begging and praying. "Come back to me."

Starry flowing light spreads out of the flask, rising and flying in the air like a dance of pure light before sliding into the thin slit between Cass' lips.

"Cass?" Dean puts his head back, reaching a finger beneath his nose to feel the breath. Faint air pushes onto his skin, but only gets weaker and thinner, until completely imperceptible.

Dean's heart bleeds painfully. Is it too late? Did they make a terrible mistake and kill Cass, again? And this time, he did it himself? He closes his eyes and feels his chest is too painful to breathe.

The lamps around the playground start flickering, lights going on and off, and then explodes one by one.

"Dean!" Sam calls out alarmingly, gun dropped into hands intuitively.

Dean snaps open his eyes and checks on Cass instantly.

Castiel has opened his eyes, though his look is remote and unfocused. Bright blue light fills into his pupil, spreading to his face, his body, and then the space around him. The light soon gets too bright to look, Dean has to look away and cover his eyes with arms. The air is buzzing with static electricity.

There is a flow of energy rushing towards them and passing by their sides without doing any harm. A word suddenly pops into Dean's mind: "solar wind." He has seen it from some science channel on TV some long time ago, introducing how the sun's activity can let out electrical waves and winds of particles that almost look like a wind. A wind made of light. That must be what is happening now. The holy creature of light is letting out the rare wonder but he can't see it with his bare eyes, just like he can't look at the Sun directly. Such a bummer.

When the buzzing electrical feeling dies down, Dean turns back and opens his eyes again.

Castiel sits up with eyes wide and gentle, locked on him.

"Dean." He says, his sound familiar and deep, though maybe a little sad and tired, but at least he's not weak or dying or anything.

Dean can't stop a smile unfurling on his face. He lets out a long relieved breaths, and lightly punches Cass on the shoulder fake-annoyedly, "Don't do that again."

Next to them, Sam also exhales in relief.

Dean stands up and holds a hand to pull Cass up. When they head back to Impala and drive back to bunker, Dean feels the weight on his shoulder is so much lighter that he even starts humming his favorite Zeppelin song when the tape rotates to "Ramble On." Sam eyes him with raised surprised eyebrow, receives a beaty head following the rhythm in reply, and can't stop beaming.

Seriousness kicks back in when Dean glances at Cass from the rear mirror and notices his still tensed shoulder. He tunes down the music.

"Okay Cass, fill us in. First thing first, how are you feeling?" Dean asks.

"I'm fine." the angel in the back seat answers, "Not dying, that's an improvement."

Dean narrows his eyes, "What happened up there? Why were you dying again? Did the angels hurt you again?" Anger builds up, he turns back to look at Cass, his right foot unconsciously pressed on the accelerator pedal.

"Dean, road! Dude, look at the road!" Sam cries out loud.

Dean looks back at the road, releasing the foot pad, the car returns to its previous speed.

Dean still doesn't give up stealing glances of Cass from the mirror. "Anyone I can punch?"

Cass looks like he's struggling with words. Dean frowns. He knows the look, that's the look every time Cass holds something back, usually right before sacrificing himself for something. He doesn't like that look.

"Is the problem solved?" Sam helps out by starting with easy questions, Cass chooses to go with that.

"No," he sighs, "it's not that easy."

"Of course not." Dean says, unsurprisingly.

"And, if you really want to know, angels didn't do anything to me, it's just how Heaven works. Without grace, as far as Heaven concerns, I'm just a human, so it would want to keep me there. It wasn't easy to come back. If I'm honest, I didn't even think I could make it." Cass averts his eyes to look at the window, though there is really nothing to see except for pure black.

Dean growls at the road ahead of him, "You knew this is gonna kill you and you did it anyway?"

Cass counters weakly, "No."

Their eyes meet in the mirror, Cass stares back at Dean's glaring eyes, "Yes? Maybe? I don't know how bad it will be, alright? I just saw there might be a shot to help and I took it."

Dean is visibly annoyed, "Okay pal, new rule, from now on, every time you need to make a move, tell us everything you know, capiche? Man, we should have this rule like forever ago."

Cass grumbles with widened eyes, "I capiche."

Dean holds back a success grin, "Good." And then, "Now back to square one, what do we know about the situation up there?"

<br>

It is bad.

Cass knows it's bad before he goes there, but the view still catches him off guard. He gasps in disbelief and pain.

He never sees so many angels being so vulnerable.

He has seen enough angels wounded or permanently damaged from the war back in the day when he was still in the garrison. His own hands have been covered with too much angel blood in the days when he did the worst wrong of all time. But none of that could compare with what he's seeing now.

It's not like war. It is not massacre. It is extinction.

Full-scale, whole-species, extinction.

The power in the Heaven is shaking violently. Power emergency alarm goes off every few seconds. Time flows differently on Heaven and on Earth, and for the mere seconds he sets foot on Heaven, it already weighs more than the eons he had existed.

Angels are dying. Dying in their true forms.

In the Heaven, angels usually choose not to carry their vessels around. So it can be difficult for humans to comprehend -- as he explains to Sam and Dean, if it's easier for them to visualize, maybe think about suited-up humans walking around in office hallways, but it's nothing like the reality.

From what he perceives, their existences are more like clusters of light and energy, dispersing and aggregating across the dimensions. And all of that, is dying out. Their lights are shattering, energy draining, grace dissipating, existence disintegrating. It could be explained much easier with a scattering wave function in hyper-dimension and unbounded space, but Sam and Dean would definitely ask him to skip this part.

It's exactly like human's Black Death. Cass thinks, Dean is right. Except this is bigger, darker, heavier.

This pandemic is not caused by a lack of hygiene or Yersinia pestis, but by... By what? Cass has no faintest idea. What can possibly destroy angels of the Lord in this massive scale, with such absoluteness? Not single angel seems to be able to get away from the contagious symptom, dark shadows spread from one cluster of light to another, entangled into every fiber of energy, eating away the brightness from inside out, erasing the angel's existence like antimatter devours the matter.

If the mixed painful voices in the angel radio were heartbroken, being in the Heaven among them and hearing them up close is truly unbearable. Cass feels himself being torn apart purely by the agony itself. It is most horrifying when the last bit of angel's light gets fully eaten up by the blackness. The frequency of their last cry is the most high-pitched sound even an angel has ever heard, scratching at the back of every angel's consciousness if they happen to be nearby. For Sam and Dean's understanding, as Castiel later describes, think of it as the most painful human moaning and screaming sound when they're being tortured and dying, mixed with the sound of finger nails scraping the surface of chalkboard or screeching metals.

<br>

"Okay, that's vivid enough." Dean cuts him off uncomfortably, "I get it, bad, real bad, horrifying ass-level bad. About right?"

They are back at the bunker now, sitting by the war room, beers in hand, books by their side.

Cass nods grimly.

"Umm, Cass?" Sam asks carefully, "What will happen if angels extinct?"

Cass breathes heavily. "I can't imagine." he says.

"'You can't imagine'? What's that supposed to mean?" Dean demands with narrowed eyes.

"There will be no Heaven. All the souls in the Heaven will be cast in the wind, billions and billions of souls banished to the Vail or the Earth. Or worse, Hell. New dying souls linger in the Vail without a place to go, before the Vail cracks with the burden. That's just the start. What do you think humans would be like when they realize there is no post-life reward after they die? There will be no eternal happiness waiting for them regardless of how much good they do when they are alive or how much pain they have suffered?" Cass tilts his head again, squinting, like a bird.

Dean stammers, "Surely the post-life reward can't be the only thing people do good for."

"Some, maybe, but how many?" Cass sighs, "This angel disease - pandemic - thing, might not directly infect humans, it might still destroy the world in the end, if given time."

Dean shares a look with Sam, "Annual world-ending event, cool. Where do we start? We don't know jack squat about the angel biology, how the hell are we gonna play doctor?"

Cass falls into thinking.

Sam suggests, in an over-optimistic voice that sounds far too deliberate, "How about we stick to the basics, work with what we know, do the research, just like it's just another case?"

"A case," Dean echoes sarcastically, "Fan-freaking-tastic."

He lays back in his favorite chair and drinks his beer, "Do you remember our job used to be beheading vampires and werewolves? Not babysitting or feeding them with soup when they get sick?" He holds out a finger just in time to stop Sam from arguing, "Don't give me that look, tell me you don't think angels are just monsters with good PR? No offence, Cass." He flashes the eyes at Cass quickly. A slow nerve at the back of his head somewhere, tells him that's a really asshole comment spitting in front of his only and best angel friend. But with the brain mostly affected by the light drowsiness coming from the beer, Dean waves the uneasy feeling off not knowing where it comes from or why.

Castiel barely moves his lips, "None taken."

Sam sighs, "I don't like them more than you do, Dean, I mean, obviously except for Cass. But that doesn't mean I want them all dead. It's bad that they are around, but it's worse if they're not. I'd rather help them out this once rather than dealing with billions of angry confusing spirits. So yeah, I'm fine with this. And maybe, if they own us one, next time they show up, we won't have to kill each other."

Dean snorts, "I'd rather hope they never show up again. But okay, points taken. Where do we start?"

Sam looks at the only angel in the room, which makes Dean turn his head in the same direction. "Start with what we know, about Cass." Sam says.

Dean frowns, still talking to Sam but not leaving his eyes away from Cass, "Well, with all due respect, first of all, he's probably the least typical of an angel by now, with all the resurrection -- not that I complain -- and hanging around on Earth with us all this time and everything in between, I won't be surprised if we end up finding out he's a whole new species on his own. And B, what are you gonna do about him? Anatomy? He's not a guinea pig for you to learn biology in college class. He's Cass!"

Cass hums a soft agreement to that obvious accurate comment.

Sam rolls his eyes at his brother, "I know that, Dean, thanks for reminding. I just mean, research --" He gestures to the mountain of books around them, "-- so will you just shut up and start reading, please?"

Dean returns a warmthless smile to that, "Super. I'll grab some more beer first."

<br>

It turns out, that the researching and heavy reading part of the job are actually not as boring as one might presume. It would be easier if there is some kind of catalogue to indicate what each book is about, but the benefit of a lack of that, is that you get to run into things you totally wouldn't expect and ends up might learning something or even enjoying the reading time.

Like the one that Dean is currently reading, "Ethereal Archetypes and Terrestrial Manifestation: A Comprehensive Ontological Examination of Transcendent Parallels between Angelic Entities and Biological Life Forms", turns out to be pretty much listing all known animals and pointing out their similarities and differences with an angel. And Dean has to hold back his laughter from time to time, and uses part of the brain to remind himself not looking up at Cass -- who sits just couple feet away from him, buried in his selection of books -- every few pages just because how accurate the description is.

The book says the angels might adopt their ways of manifestation by learning all animal behaviors, including but not limited to the man kind, examples including the way they tilt heads to look at target object comes from birds, most likely pigeons, they can be protective like dogs, cunning like cats, and show great connection and closeness with creatures that last as long as they do, so they may guard jellyfish and bees as much as humans.

The more Dean reads, the more he feels like he has to introduce Cass to whoever writes this book, it is almost as if they are literally describing Cass back to him. But pitifully, the behavioral descriptions are not giving much information about how exactly can they cure a sick angel. So Dean tosses the book aside, putting a note in his head thinking he might want to ask Cass about what's the deal with jellyfish.

The next book talks about perceived hierarchy and social structure of Heaven and Hell and their resemblance, which leads to its religious and cultural meaning. But Dean already notices some mistakes in the book, since he seriously doubts if any of the writers have ever run into any Prince of Hell or Knight of Hell. He might as well run a fact check with Cass about these things.

The next is about angelic occupational division, followed by experimentations with angel feathers, and then more. Okay Dean decides to take his words back, it stops feeling entertaining long ago, now he'd rather go out punch something. The only thing that keeps him continue scrambling the pages is the thought that he might learn more about bits and pieces about angels -- about Cass -- that might come handy later down the road.

By the time he clears out all the books piled on his left side, Dean can barely recognize the word "angel". In his brain, the meaning of that word gets auto-translated to, "Cass".

Right around the time when Dean wonders if he can sneak out of the room without the rest two of them noticing, Sam shouts out his eureka, "I find something! Hmm, maybe. I think."

"Aren't you a scholarship boy." Dean appreciatedly lays down the book that might has more than a thousand pages and gets up quickly, "What do you get?"

Dean and Cass gathers around him, each taking a side of the chair and sitting on the armrest.

Sam fingers the line he's reading. It's in Enochian. Apparently Sam learns to read Enochian some time secretly and Dean is the only one in the room blinking blankly right now.

Cass translates for them, "You can't have shadow without light. The purest of all light can purify darkness."

Sam points at a short line of hand-written notes in the margin right by the Enochian, "I'm actually reading this note."

Dean leans closer, "'Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that.' Why does that sound so familiar?"

Sam answers, "Martin Luther King Jr., the guy is a genius."

"And that's connected to our problem how?" Dean frowns, "Please don't tell me it's the Darkness problem again." Flash memory of Amara appears in front of him again, he moves his feet uneasily.

"Sort of. I think." Sam explains, "I have a theory, what if, this angel black death is actually a leftover symptom from getting too close to the Darkness? Angels' true forms are like lights, right? Light gets covered by the darkness, so with the opposite of the light, the lack of light, in their system, they can't recover, so they're dying. It sort of makes sense."

"And the cure is more light?" Dean manages to catch up.

"I don't think we can get Chuck or Amara back to fix this -- even if we can, to be honest, I don't really want to see them again so soon." Sam says, "So the only option is just this --"

"The purest of all light." Cass finishes his sentence. "But what does that mean? Who, or what, has the brightest purest light?"

Realization hits all of them at the same time. Though it comes with a different name.

Sam stuns and breathes, "Lucifer."

At the very same moment, Cass says, "Michael."

Dean blinks once, then goes, "Ca -- Chuck."

They look at each other, swallow at the names.

Sam breaks the silence first, "Chuck is out of reach, so that leaves exactly two options. And we just need them to, hmm --" he reads the small texts below the Enochian line, his brow raised high, "-- give away their light willingly. The cost of purification will take away all the light from the source. And only a determined mind can last long enough to not interrupt the purification process."

Cass adds thoughtfully, "We might actually need both of them. The infection comes from Amara, we would have needed Chuck to cure this. Now that we can only get archangels, one doesn't seem quite enough."

Dean steps back slowly to lean on the table. "Wait so, let me get this straight, the solution is to let Michael *and* Lucifer to what, willingly sacrifice themselves to save all angels and humans? Yeah not happening."

Sam thinks about it for a second, "I don't know, I mean, we get God and Devil work together once, and then God and Darkness. That makes two archangels seem easier."

"We might as well put up a sign in front of the bunker: 'Celestial family drama counseling office', subtitle: 'For free once a year, if doesn't work, feel free to end the world'. Nice plan, Dr. Phil." Dean waves his hands in the air, gesturing the imaginary signs.

"You get a better one?" Sam raises his brows.

Dean stammers, looking at Cass for support, and in return the angel only gestures to Sam, very clearly saying "You know Sam is right" without actually saying it.

Dean sighs annoyedly, "When can we get out of this we'll-end-the-world-or-the-world-will-end crap? Shit just never stop hitting fans!"

Cass gives him a upset smile.

And Sam sighs a soft "Yeah".

## Draft:

Metallica lyrics: Chasing Light "down and out as darkness falls, shakes the cage in deep withdrawals, without darkness there’s no light, but he is someone’s little boy"

System of a Down: "angels deserve to die" (Cass: Do I deserve to die? Do they?)

Beyond the Black: In the Shadows "It's so hard to kill the demons, When they live inside your heart"

Within Temptation: Stairway to The Skies "Perdition awaits my soul is at stake

Will I find a stairway to the skies

In the end?"

Xandria: You Will Never be Our God "I've been in Hell for many years

And all the time is lost for me, for eternity

I try to take back what was mine

A prison they have made my mind, my enemy"

Dean: What's that, take away that metal crap will you? (Heard first lyrics) Wait, they might on to something.

(Reuse Vince Vincent's and Ladyheart part of plot, TFW go to LA, rock and metal festival, chapter name remains: rock never dies)

<br>

Dean: it’s like putting two nuclear together and hope they don’t explode! What’s the odds?

They all agree Dean should get nowhere close to Michael and same goes for Sam and Lucifer, so Sam and Rowena go to Michael, Dean and Cass go to Lucifer

appreciable -> grateful
