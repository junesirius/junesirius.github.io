<br>

They're celebrating. Just the three of them in the bunker's kitchen, Sam, Dean, and Cass, with several dozens of beer and a full table of (now almost empty) pizza boxes. But nevertheless, it's a big celebration.

"Finally, finally!" Dean is saying, over a bottle of beer, can't stop beaming, "A big win long overdue, here we go!"

"Yeah I hear you." Sam agrees, a little over himself too, lazily leaning into the seat by the wall, sipping his share of beer. "No God, no Darkness, no angel, no demon, no new freaking Apocalypse, no bigger disaster when the old one is barely missed. How long have we ever really get this much peace, if ever?"

Cass seriously considers his question. "At least eleven years ago." He answers, with a straight face.

Dean looks up from his bottle, beaming brighter, "Good to have you back, Cass."

Cass meets his eyes and nods, "So are you, Dean. I'm very glad you're ok."

Dean studies his face, and Cass holds his stare -- actually, from where Sam is, it looks like they are just both silently studying each other, looking for tiniest trace of some kind of portent, as if they didn't pretty much spend every second of the last couple hours together.

"How are you really, Cass?" Dean asks first, voice soft. Judging by how Cass parts his lips and pauses, he was beaten by a millisecond by the same question he was just about to ask Dean.

"I'm fine." Cass says, his smile drops a little, the voice sounds like a hidden sigh. He shifts the eyes, turns to take a deep drink of whatever liquor that was in the glass in front of him.

"No post-Devil-possession syndrome?" Dean chases his eyes, "Just, you know, when has things ever been easy for us? I'm just thinking loud, in case there is anything, we might want to give the celebration a rain check."

Cass stares back with slightly widened eyes, "No, there is no such syndrome, and I feel fine."

With that, he narrows his eyes and throws the question back, "What about you? No 'post-Darkness-entanglement-and-soul-bomb' syndrome?"

His fingers did an air quote and Dean finds his eyes automatically get distracted and glued on his fingers. He answers with a shrug, "No, nothing, I feel peachy."

"Great! Urgh, that is, great!" Sam cuts in quickly, looking at the watch on his wrist in a very deliberate motion. "Well, it's late, and it's been a hell of a day. Think I'll hit bed now."

Dean hums an acknowledgement, takes another drink slowly, and asks thoughtfully, "Do you think, when the sun was gone and then re-appear, the time should be reset? Like, it's a new day or something? Hell, it's probably a whole new era when future historians look back."

Sam lets out a short laugh, "Wow, Philosopher, I'll leave you to think about that." He stands up and pats his brother on the shoulder briefly, nods at Cass on his way out, and then disappears outside of the kitchen door.

Dean and Cass look at the direction where Sam took off, taking gulps of drink almost simultaneously, enjoying the comfortable lazy silence between them for a while longer.

After god-knows-how-long, Dean finally decides to put down his drink and glance at his watch, "Guess Sam is right, as much as I like to stay, I'm probably too old for the overnight carnival and celebration now. Need to pass out for a couple of hours." He stands up staggeringly, feeling his eyes can barely stay open now, more tiredness than drunkenness.

"I understand." Cass stands up too, follows him out of the kitchen and helps Dean get back to his room before he almost takes a wrong turn.

"Get some rest, Dean." Cass says, his hands still holding some of Dean's weight before making sure he's secure on his own bed. Then he gestures the other end of the corridor, "I'll just take the guest room."

"Good night, Cass." Dean mumbles, though Cass suspects he might already fell in sleep before finishing the sentence.

Cass turns off the light and stays by the door just a second too long. "Good night, Dean."

Something is wrong.

Something is always wrong, like they say, with the Winchesters. But this feels... not really *wrong* wrong, but *off*.

"I don't know how to tell you, Sammy, it's like my hair is in the wrong direction, or... or spider sense gets triggered or something." Dean is a little irritated, hands flying everywhere trying vainly to compensate for the lack of accurate words. "My gut says so, ok? And I know better than ignoring an intuition. Something is definitely off but I don't know what."

Sam presses his palms on the forehead. They shouldn't have this conversation before they even have their first cup of coffee of the day. This shouldn't be how the second day after saving the universe starts like. But here they are.

"Your gut telling you anything else? A bit more details?" Sam presses the power button on the coffee machine, and turns back to face his brother. "Heaven? Hell? Up? Down? From anywhere? Anyone we can call?"

"It's my gut, Sam," Dean stares at him, "not Google, how the hell would I know?"

Sam sighs, "You sure it's not a post-traumatic stress something? Or a nightmare? Maybe you should just take some more rest. You did only confront face to face with the Darkness and almost die yesterday after all."

Dean rounds his eyes, his voice on the edge of snapping, "I know what PTSD is, and this isn't that, alright?"

Sam debates whether to point out that Dean didn't handle that well after he came back from Hell or Purgatory, maybe this is just like those times, but looking at Dean's face, he swallows the thought back. "You talked to Cass about that yet?" is what he decides to go with.

"No..." Dean pauses, looks around, pauses again, and almost amused, "Did... did he oversleep even later than us?"

Sam spreads his hands.

The next thought coming immediately after hits both of them at the same moment. Dean stiffens and Sam straights up from pouring newly made coffee, they share a tense look.

It can't be good. Angels don't sleep, and the few other times when Cass did sleep, he's either dying of a lack of grace or already became human. Or worse, the no-show could be another quiet leave without goodbye where he decides to do his own things, and that usually doesn't turn out very well.

Dean and Sam rush towards the guest room.

Dean gets there first and starts bumping on the door. "Cass, you in there?" He raises voice over his own pounding sounds.

A mumbling voice answers from inside, but sounds a hell lot like moaning. Dean lets out a breath that he doesn't know he was holding, but almost immediately holds it again.

They both tilt head trying to hear better what Cass is saying, but the usually-too-thin door suddenly seems too sound-proof now to catch any sentence.

Dean takes two steps back and lifts one leg, ready to kick his way in, and Sam is right on time to put a hand in front of him to stop, "Whoa, hey, have you tried to turn the door knob?"

Dean gives him a look, looking not at all guilty of not thinking straight, "Good idea."

He turns the door knob, and the door opens obediently. Dean deliberately ignores Sam's look on the back of his head.

Cass is in the room, sitting by his clean and clearly not-slept-on bed, hands pressed firmly on the temple, eyes shut tight, looking too concentrated that it looks almost like pain.

Dean dashes inside, holding him around the shoulder, shaking slightly, "Hey, hey Cass, what's wrong? What happened?"

Cass looks like he has to take great effort to put his hands down and set the volume in his head lower before he can even try to start talking.

"It's angel radio." He looks at Dean with a grimace, his face wrinkled with agony, "Something is happening to the angels, they're getting sick and dying fast. From what I can hear, it's contagious and deadly. So much voice, so much pain. I have to go now."

"Wait, wait, hold on a second, Cass, not so fast." Dean presses him back to bed right when he tries to stand up. "Contagious and deadly, you say?"

Cass nods, "Yes, it appears so."

"And you are, what, just gonna walk straight into it?" Dean's eyes are probably literally glaring now. "Like a man walking into a Black Death plague town?"

Cass stares at him, voice starting to get harsh, "Yes! I'm not a man, and I have to know more. Angels are dying, I can't just sit here doing nothing!"

"Well, you can't help if you're dead or sick too." Dean points out, then adds half-jokingly, "Besides, who cares if a few flying monkeys died, it's not like they're so friendly or helpful before. Personally I still feel there are too many of them around, might as well..."

"Dean." Sam warns quietly, and Dean shuts up just in time.

Cass shakes off Dean's hands on his shoulder and stands up, his eyes are almost furious now. Dean can't say he didn't flinch. It reminds him of the first time seeing Castiel in that barn. Even without his wings, Cass can sometimes still be very terrifying.

"Sorry, didn't mean to..." Dean starts but gets cut off.

Cass grits his teeth, "In case you forget, *I* happen to also be one of the 'flying monkeys'." The air quotes almost get Dean choked on his own suppressed laughter. He has to fight hard to stop the face muscle from twitching.

"They might be ass-butts from time to time, but they are still my brothers and sisters." Castiel says sternly, Dean avoids his glares and can't help but feel a little hurt, even if he understands, he really does. The word "brother" might just mean differently sometimes.

"So yes, I am going back to Heaven to see what's happening, to save them if I can or die trying." Castiel concludes.

"We'll go with you." Words slip out of Dean's tongue before his brain catches what he's saying.

"Dean, seriously?" Sam says, Dean almost forgets he's still there.

Cass' expression gets slightly softer, "No, you can't, Dean. It will kill you, and you know that. No human can be in Heaven. I have to go alone."

"Or ask the sick ones come to earth?" Dean suggests hopefully, "So you don't have to be around all those coughing sneezing guys."

"Do we know if this angel sickness would pass on to human?" Sam asks.

Cass looks at Sam for the first time after they come into his room. "I don't think so." he says, "Angels technically don't exist in the same dimension as humans, we only manifest into this dimension when we need to. So whatever this is, I don't think it can cross dimension."

"Awesome," Dean loosens up slightly, "good to know humans won't extinct because the flying dudes poke at the wrong place."

"But I don't think they can be moved to Earth or if they'd be willing to." Cass looks back at Dean.

"Why not?"

"Would you be willing to go to a strange new place, like abroad or the Moon, when you're seriously sick or dying?" Cass squints his eyes.

"Fair point." Sam admits while Dean makes a funny little defeated sound with nose.

"So can we all agree now that I need to go now?" Cass sighs, getting noticeably more impatient as time passes by.

Sam opens and closes his mouth a few times, looks like he still tries to object but doesn't know what to say. Dean stares at one far end on the ground, eyes unfocused, seems to be deep in thought.

Cass walks towards the door.

"What if," Dean holds out a finger, but still locks his eyes on that spot on the floor, not out of the contemplate, "what if you become human?"

The room fall silent, Dean looks up to two x-ray gazes that are so sharp that he almost can feel the cut on his skin. He shifts his feet, "Hear me out, you said humans can't get infected by this angelic black death, right? And you had been back to Heaven before even without or with little of your grace. So if we can somehow drain your grace to almost like a human, you go there, poke around, solve the problem, and come back juice up, voila, problem solved."

"Dean," Sam sighs, "I don't even want to start on how many things can go wrong there."

"I'm not saying I like it." Dean eyes him, then focuses back on the only angel in the room, "Hell, I even hate myself for saying that, God knows how difficult it is every time you lose your mojo, but it's still better than being sick and dead, a thousand times better."

Castiel considers.

Dean studies him.

Sam studies them both. Like how things have always been between them.

"So?" Dean asks hopefully, "Would it work?"

"Perhaps." Cass says solemnly and slowly. The way he tilts his head, it looks like he's half thinking, half listening to the angel radio again.

"Great." Dean says cheerfully, gestures to his brother and mouths, "See, I'm a genius." Sam snorts with a light curl on the edge of the lip.

"So, what do we need?" Sam asks.

"Nothing we don't have in the bunker." Cass heads towards one of the stock room by the library, Sam and Dean follow him closely.
