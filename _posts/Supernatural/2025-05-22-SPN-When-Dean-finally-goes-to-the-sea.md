"What should I do?" Dean asks.

It is the second day after Sam and Eileen's wedding, they're packing for a honeymoon trip.

Dean figures a third wheel isn't really a good idea. He just nurses a beer, watching them get ready.

Eileen steals glances at Sam every now and then. And every time Sam catches it, he smiles.

Dean watches the gleamy light in their eyes, and he sips the beer with a small smile of his own. His little brother has become a man and is going to have the life he always wanted. Dean is happy for them, he genuinely is.

"Not like I can hunt alone anymore," Dean says, matter-of-factly. He kneads his right leg around the knee.

It's been about two years since an accident with a demon. That knee was hurt pretty badly, and he had to lie in bed for almost two full months with a splint Sam insisted on. And it's been bothering him ever since. It cracks and squeaks like an old rusty part on Baby that needs a change, and it hurts like a bitch every time about half an hour before a rain.

He was restless and sulky at the beginning -- probably for a whole year, according to Sam -- but by now, even he has to face reality. Age and accumulated wounds over the years are dragging him down. Without an angel to heal him, this is probably the end of his hunting career.

"Retiring at forty-five isn't so bad," Sam has said something like that, probably trying to comfort him. "Most nine-to-fivers can't even dream about it."

"Not like we have any 401k," Dean answered automatically.

"Not like we really need to worry about credit cards or rent," Sam pointed out the obvious.

Dean just shrugged.

After another year working on the command center slash research center from the bunker, Dean realized even that had been taken care of -- Jody and the girls are surprisingly good at research, and there are new hunters popping up like mushrooms after rain.

He felt like the nameless old hunters he used to see in the Roadhouse -- talking too loud and smelling like stale alcohol, and then one day disappearing from the bar. Nothing left but a story about what happened to them.

<br>

"Something you always wanted to do but never got time for?" Sam suggests, somewhere in the middle of packing his flannels and socks, pulling him back.

"Not sure I have one of those," Dean says. He does try to think, but he comes up with nothing.

It's like that time when the Four Horsemen rose from Hell and Famine hit the town. Everyone wanted something, Sam for demon blood, Cas -- and Jimmy -- for red meat. And Dean -- Dean just found his chest empty. He couldn't think of anything he really wanted then, and he finds himself not want anything at all now. What did Famine say the reason was?

He thinks about the burgers Cas chewed and swallowed. The crumpled paper wrappers in his hand.

"Didn't you use to say you wanted to go all these places when we retire? Las Vegas, Hawaii, go to the beach, open a B&B?" Sam recalls the old memories, a look of nostalgia on his face. "When we were knee-deep in one of those world-ending events, you told me that, remember?"

"Yeah, I remember." Dean takes another sip at the beer, finding it's empty already. He didn't notice when he finished it.

"Go somewhere then, do something. Just, don't be alone." Sam tells him before leaving.

<br>

Sam and Eileen go to Ireland first, because Eileen wants to show him her childhood memories. Dean visits Jody and hangs around their dinner table, until even he finds himself probably has overstayed a little too long.

The happy newlyweds travel to somewhere in Europe and send back pictures of street food and foreign temples. Dean goes to Garth's place, hanging out with the pups. Tiny Sam and tiny Castiel babble baby talk and spill leftover food all over him. Dean acts as their makeshift babysitter, until he has to admit he's not the best person for the job.

Dean drives on the open road, not really sure where to go. The sky turns bright in the morning and goes dark at night. Time ticks by, the world spins around him. He feels like an extra person to the world, like the universe accidentally created one human more than it meant to, and now he just drifts.

The bunker is too empty, too quiet, too large now. Dean doesn't go back there.

*Don't be alone.* Sam has warned him.

Sam knows him too well.

But he's all alone now. He's all alone always. Even when he's with Jody and Garth and in the noisiest bar, he's alone, just like that night when the Earth was wiped of all the lives by Chuck, when he sat on the cold dungeon floor.

It's been five years since then.

Dean drives west, where the sea is.

<br>

It's early summer, and it's California. Which means visitors and travelers all over the beach.

Dean drives along the coast on Highway 101, and doesn't stop until he finds a quiet enough stretch of shore.

There are more rocks than sand on the beach, which is probably why barely anyone's around. Dean parks the Impala.

The sun hangs low in the west, setting slowly. The sea breathes like a giant sleeping creature, heaving and retracting its waves like a living chest.

The blue of the water is darker than he imagined. Darker than the color in Cas's eyes.

Dean walks toward the water in his shirt and pants, standing where the waves wash over his bare feet. The temperature is chilly, refreshing.

The air smells of too much salt.

*The safest demon-free zone,* Dean thinks, grinning slightly at the joke that pops into his head.

But there is no one to share the joke. The tip of his lips drops quickly.

He watches the wave push and pull, white foam forming a long line from one end of the world to the other. He understands now why people before the Age of Exploration would think the world is flat, and that the sea is the end of the world.

Standing on the beach, looking at the far horizon, it really feels that way.

Dean looks up at the sky, seeing a dozen seagulls flying in organized formation. They take a turn above his head, and head back toward the sea.

He wonders what it is like to fly. He wonders what Cas's wings looked like, when he could still fly.

Then he wonders about Heaven.

He has to stop himself there.

Dean walks into the water, letting it flow from his feet, cover his protesting knees, reach his hips, then chest, then shoulders.

He takes a breath, and lets the water submerge above his head.

Sam would freak out if he were here. Dean thinks. But he's not here.

The world under the water is quiet, quieter than any time when he's above it. The waves shake around him, forming gentle turbulence. Bright sunlight pierces through the surface, reaching him below the water.

It's calm here. The water is gentle.

Dean opens his eyes, finding his mind quiet of thoughts and words, leaving only the breathing rhythm of the sea.

He's not too far away from the shore, and he doesn't really have any plan to walk deeper into the water.

He exhales shallowly, watching bubbles emerge from the corner of his mouth and float toward the surface. He can probably still indulge himself for another minute or two.

He lets the water envelop around him, and it feels good. It feels like a hug. And the water feels warm. It feels like a palm on his shoulders, an embrace at his back.

The breathing of the sea sounds like the breathing of someone by his ear. The blue of the water and sky, looks like the blue of someone's eyes.

Dean closes his eyes, feeling more at ease than any time in the past five years. Feeling less alone than any time in the past five years.

He feels --

-- like he's being held by the sea.

By something big and beautiful, and very, very old. And very, very kind.

By someone loves him very much, and left to save him.

He breathes out slowly, running out of all the air he saved.

He lets himself think about Cas.

<br>

He emerges from the water, and sits on the beach.

The sun has set, Dean continues watching the sea.

Darkness falls, the air turns cold, and the waves move the same as ever. The same peaceful quiet rhythm, steady like a heartbeat, under the night sky.

It looks like it can wash clean everything in the universe. It can take away all the pain and loss, it can wash all the wounds and drown all the tears.

*Is that why it's salty? Because it has contained too much pain and too many tears?* Dean wonders.

And it can take more.

It is taking his too.

Dean thinks that probably explains why it's making him calm and quiet. Because the sea has taken care of everything.

He wonders why they never came to the sea earlier. When they still could. When all three of them still could.

He wants to buy them matching shirts and martinis.

<br>

Sam calls him when he's still on the beach.

It's a video call.

Dean shows him and Eileen the sea.

Sam is visibly happy to see him out here.

"Is there anyone else with you?" Sam asks him.

Dean looks at the blue of the sea. "Yeah," he smiles, "there is."
