> <u>Interior of a crappy motel room. We look down upon Castiel lying in bed, half-wearing a robe.</u> His phone lights up and starts to vibrate on the nightstand next to him.
>
> Castiel: Sam. Hello.
>
> Sam: I think I might have found something.
>
> Castiel: <u>Oh good, good. (coughs several times painfully)</u>
>
> Sam: Cass? You there?
>
> Castiel: It's okay, I'm... um... I'm okay. Go... go on. <u>(coughs more painfully)</u>
>
> Sam: Alright, get this. A "John Doe" who was murdered in Wisconsin a week ago turns out to be this guy named Drew Nealy who went missing from religious order in Northern Ohio... okay?
>
> Castiel: Yeah? <u>(more coughing)</u>
>
> Sam: Now, Drew Nealy had been missing for 3 years. Killed his wife, his kids... just disappeared. I know it's thin, but... if this guy was possessed...
>
> Castiel: That would make him the first... <u>(another coughing fit)</u>
>
> Sam: The first lead, the first anything we've seen in... <u>(Sam stops himself, hearing Castiel's nonstop coughing)</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>(coughs) Sorry.</u>
>
> Sam: Actually... you know what... now that I'm looking at this more I think I uh... I think I jumped the gun here, buddy.
>
> Castiel: No, Sam, you said it was something.
>
> Sam: Yeah... uh... it's... it's not. I was wrong, sorry.
>
> Castiel: <u>I can help.</u>
>
> Sam: Cass... we tried that.
>
> Castiel: <u>Sam... you can't blame what that demon did to your shoulder on me; you were out of...</u>
>
> Sam: I'm not, I'm not blaming anything on you. What happened, happened, and... <u>you need to be worrying about yourself. I really shouldn't have bothered you.</u>
>
> Castiel: How are you, Sam?
>
> Sam: Good. I'm alright. I'm just... tired, you know. Be better when we get him back... after... after I kick his butt.
>
> Castiel: <u>I miss him.</u>
>
> Sam: Yeah.
>
> Castiel: Why would he just disappear?
>
> Sam: Who says he had a choice?
>
> Castiel: Well then, who wrote the note? If there's any chance... any chance at all that Dean is still...
>
> Sam: Still... even remotely Dean?
>
>
> Sam sadly hangs up the phone, as does Castiel.

> Crowley: <u>I needed to keep you sharp for our future</u>, about which we need to talk.
>
> Dean: Our future?
>
> Crowley: <u>Our professional future.</u> How to put this? If I have to spend one more night in this fetid petri dish of broken dreams and B.O., I will cut off my own face.
>
> Dean: (sitting back down) I don't know what you're talking about. 'Cause I'm good. Hell, I'm great.
>
> Crowley: Really? How many suicide wings can you eat? How many one-hit wonders can you karaoke to death?
>
> Dean: Okay, see, the deal was we howl at the moon -- no time stamp, no expiration date.
>
> Crowley: <u>We've howled. We've bayed. We've done extraordinary things to triplets, all of which have been massively entertaining. I will treasure our Flickr albums forever. But now it's time for us to accept what we are and go back to work.</u>
>
> Dean: Pass.
>
> Crowley: <u>Think of it -- the king of hell, Dean Winchester by his side. Together we rule. Together we create the perfect hell. And all of this that's bloomed between us never ends. We're not ending the party. We're just moving the party. Out with the club circuit, in with the stadium tour.</u> Oh. Did I forget to mention I spoke to moose earlier?
>
> Dean: What?
>
> Crowley: Yes. Uh, apparently, he's been tracking us for some time now. He got my text from the cell of that demon that you stabbed in blah, blah, blah. It was -- words were spoken -- emotions. I realize, in retrospect, perhaps too many words, too many emotions.
>
> Dean: He traced the call.
>
> Crowley: My bad. I guess he'll be here by morning -- the latest.
>
> Dean: You sold me out. Well, that's just lovely.
>
> Crowley: I don't know what's going on with you. I truly don't. But I've had just about enough of it. Sold you out? <u>Try "doing you a favor." everything I've done for you for the past six months -- the mark, the First Blade, midwifing you back to life, offering you a seat by my side -- has been a favor, a gift, whether you see it or you don't. Take the night. Decide. You know where to find me.</u>

> Hannah: I just...Castiel...I think the Winchesters are a bad influence on you.
>
> Castiel: Sam and Dean may be a bit rough around the edges, but they're the best men I've ever known. And they're my friends.

> Inside the house, Hannah opens the fridge and <u>Castiel takes off his trench coat and lies down on the couch.</u> Hannah pulls the casserole from the fridge.
>
> She walks into the other room and sees that <u>Castiel has fallen asleep.</u> She gently lays his trench coat over him.

> CASTIEL wakes up to find the tow-truck driver's young daughter sitting at the end of the couch eating cereal and watching cartoons.
>
> DAUGHTER: Hello.
>
> CASTIEL: Hi.
>
> DAUGHTER: Did you have a good dream?
>
> CASTIEL: Well... <u>I, uh... I don't really dream.</u>
>
> DAUGHTER: Why? One time, I dreamed that my snot was a rocket, and it shot into space and knocked down the stars to make room for more rockets!
>
> CASTIEL: <u>(smiling at the little girl) That sounds like some very special snot.</u>

> Crowley is listening to a boring progress report from a stunt demon. He looks immensely bored.
>
> Stunt Demon #1: At the end of the day, we have to strategically calibrate expectations. And so, by making these 64 small changes...I believe we can increase our demon-conversion rate by 0.03%.
>
> Crowley: Kill me.
>
> Dean enters.
>
> Crowley: Dean! How did it go?
>
> Dean: Fine. Fine. Uh... He's dead, and you're right -- I-I feel amazing.
>
> Crowley: "He"?
>
> Dean: Uh, Lester.
>
> Crowley: <u>The client? You killed the client?</u>
>
> Dean: Does it matter? He was a douche. Now he's a dead douche.
>
> Crowley: Of course it matters! The deal was one dead wife for one soul. The wife's not dead, I don't get the soul. It's math.
>
> Dean: (turning to leave) Well...There you go.
>
> Crowley: Hey! don't turn your back on me!
>
> Dean turns around with cold eyes and with one shove sends Crowley sprawling on the floor. Dean chuckles coldly.
>
> Crowley: Is something funny?
>
> Stunt Demon #2: No, sir.
>
> Crowley: (getting up) Good. What do you think you're doing?
>
> Dean: Oh, whatever I want.
>
> Crowley: Really? Because I think you don't know what you want. Tell me, Dean -- what are you? A demon? If so, why isn't Lester's wife dead? Did you feel sorry for her? So maybe you're human. Except you have those pretty black peepers and you're working alongside me. <u>Why don't you do us all a great big favor and PICK A BLOODY SIDE?!</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Or what? Hmm? Go ahead. Make a move. See how it ends. I ain't your friggin' bestie, and I ain't taking orders from you. When I need to kill, I'll call. Until then, stay out of my way.</u>
>
> Crowley: <u>Fine. It's over. What can I say? Crazy ones -- well, they're good for a fling, but they're not relationship material.</u>
>
> Dean: Are you done?
>
> Crowley: <u>We're done. You know what, Dean? It's not me. It's you.</u>

> Metatron: Ah. Like I said -- white-hot spark. So, do we have a deal?
>
> Castiel: No. What are you doing?
>
> Metatron: Ugh. You know perfectly well what she's doing, ass-tiel.
>
> Hannah: <u>I had to. You are dying.</u>
>
> Metatron: She's right. You totally are.
>
> Castiel: You shut up!
>
> Hannah: He said your Grace -- it's still out there.
>
> Castiel: He's lying. He is a liar.
>
> Metatron: Hey, words hurt!
>
> Castiel: <u>Listen to me, Hannah. You don't want this. I have seen what -- I've made deals born of desperation, and they always end in blood and tears -- always.</u>
>
> Hannah: So I'm supposed to let you...
>
> Castiel: <u>Yes. It's my life, and it's my choice. And I don't want this.</u>
>
> Hannah: I... You're right. I'm sorry.
>
> Hannah leaves.
>
> Metatron: You're wrong. Not about the lying part. I am a terrific liar. But there is some of your mojo left. Not a lot... But enough. And it can be yours for the low, low price of --
>
> Castiel: <u>Keep it.</u>
>
> Metatron: Seriously?
>
> Castiel: <u>I've made peace with my fate.</u>
>
> Metatron: Who's the liar now?
>
> Castiel: I enjoy thinking about you locked up in here, rotting until the end of time. It's my... happy place.
>
> Metatron: Yeah? Uh... No. I'll get out. It may take a century. May take a millennium or two, but this dump will not hold me forever. And when I'm free -- here's a little sneak preview -- everybody dies.
>
> Castiel: You... You talk too much.

> Demon: Majesty, supplicants await without.
>
> Crowley: Without what?
>
> Demon: ...Outside.
>
> Crowley: Let them wait.
>
> Demon: They've waited a long time.
>
> Crowley: <u>It's Hell. You wait. It's what you do.</u>

> Back at the station, <u>Crowley has the grace near Castiel's mouth, but Cass leans away, lifting a hand to push Crowley away.</u>
>
> Crowley: <u>Don't be an idiot. Yes, it's hers, but she was killing your girlfriend. Your hands are clean. As much as it pains me to say this... You're useless to me dead.</u>
>
> <U>The grace goes in Cass' mouth, and lights up his body. Hannah comes to the door, just in time to see Cass stand up, injuries healed.</u>
>
> Crowley: You owe me.
>
> Castiel: Why did you help me?
>
> Crowley: Purely business. Since you're five miles away from the Winchester's Clubhouse, I can only surmise that you're headed there. And that Dean has become a handful. Having him as a demon has caused me nothing but grief. Fix the problem.
>
> Castiel: <u>You realize, worst come to worst... That means killing him.</u>
>
> Crowley: I'm not sentimental.
>
> Crowley walks away, and Hannah comes to stand by Castiel.

> Dean comes walking down the hall, still holding the hammer.
>
> Dean: Come on, Sammy! Let's have a beer, talk about it. I'm tired of playing. Let's finish this game!
>
> Sam is breathing hard, back up against the wall. He chances a look down the hall, but finds it empty. He turns back around, ducking just in time, as Dean swings the hammer at his head, instead lodging it into the wall. Sam reacts on instinct, pushing his knife against Dean's throat. Dean smiles.
>
> Dean: Well... Look at you. Do it. It's all you.
>
> Sam lets the knife fall, and <u>Dean smiles as his eyes go black. He takes a step towards Sam, grunting when arms suddenly come around him.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>It's over.</u>
>
> <u>Cass' eyes begin to glow blue with his grace.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Dean, it's over.</u>
>
> <u>Dean begins to yell, and Cass just holds him.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>It's over.</u>
>
> Dean is once again strapped to the chair, and Sam pulls a needle from his arm. There are needle marks on Dean's arm now, close by the Mark of Cain. Dean is slumped over, head hanging.
>
> Sam: What the hell are we doing to him, Cass? I mean, even after I gave him all that blood, he still said he didn't want to be cured, that he didn't want to be human.
>
> Castiel: Well... I see his point. You know, only humans can feel real joy, but... also such profound pain. This is easier.
>
> Dean wakes up, and his eyes are black. The black dissipates, and Sam unscrews the flask in his hand. Dean looks up to Sam and Cass, groaning and letting out a breath. He looks around, uncertain, while Sam and Cass watch him carefully.
>
> Dean: You look worried, fellas.
>
> Sam splashes holy water on Dean's face, and Dean looks up at him when nothing happens. Sam smiles.
>
> Sam: Welcome back, Dean.

> In his room, Dean is looking through his pictures. A knock sounds at his door.
>
> Dean: Yeah.
>
> Castiel: (opens the door) You look terrible.
>
> Dean: <u>(laughs) You know, it wouldn't kill you to lie every now and again.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>No, it wouldn't kill me. I just... You...</u>
>
> Dean: Forget it. Well, you, on the other hand, <u>you... Looking good. So... Are you back?</u>
>
> Castiel: At least temporarily. It's a long story. Crowley, stolen grace. There's a female outside in the car.
>
> Dean stares at him, and Cass shakes his head.
>
> Castiel: Another time.
>
> Dean: Well, thank you for, um... Stepping in when you did.
>
> Cass nods.
>
> Dean: <u>What did Sam say? Does he want a divorce?</u>
>
> Castiel: I'm sure Sam knows that whatever you said or what you did, it wasn't really you. It certainly wasn't all you.
>
> Dean: I tried to kill him, Cass.
>
> Castiel: Dean. You two have been through so much. Look, you're brothers. <u>It'd take a lot more than trying to kill Sam with a hammer to make him want to walk away.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>You realize how screwed up our lives are that that even makes sense?</u>
>
> Cass laughs.
>
> Dean: <u>I'm glad you're here, man.</u>
>
> Cass starts to leave, then turns back.
>
> Castiel: Hey, maybe you should um... take some time before you get back to work. Allow yourself to heal. It's, uh... I don't know. The timing might be right. <u>Heaven and Hell -- they seem reasonably back in order. It's quiet out there.</u>
