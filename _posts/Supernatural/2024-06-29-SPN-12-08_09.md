> Mary and Castiel standing at opposite ends of the map table.
>
> Mary: You left them.
>
> Castiel: No, I... Dean told me to go. The woman--
>
> Mary: The one you lost?
>
> Castiel: I didn't. I... I thought that she--
>
> Mary: Stop making excuses.
>
> <u>Cass looks down, and Mary sighs heavily.</u>
>
> Mary: Why... if they needed help, why didn't they call me?
>
> Castiel: You were out.
>
> Mary: (sighs) How did we let this happen, Castiel?

> Another bar, Mary and Castiel.
>
> Mary: Thanks for meeting me. I just wanted to say (clears throat) I'm sorry. I was angry, and... <u>Sam and Dean, that's not your fault.</u>
>
> Castiel: No, you were right. <u>I should never have left them.</u> I... Have you heard anything?
>
> Mary: All my law enforcement contacts are retired, or... dead. (sighs) I'm trying, but... You?
>
> Castiel shakes his head.
>
> Mary: I keep telling myself they're fine. They've only been gone--
>
> Castiel: <u>Six weeks, two days, and ten hours.</u>
>
> Mary: We'll find them, Castiel. We will. Until then, we just... We're doin' our best.
>
> Castiel: Are we? Did you hear about the murders in Lancaster, Missouri?
>
> Mary: No.
>
> Castiel: The women with their throats ripped out, the blood drained?
>
> Mary: Vampire.
>
> Castiel: <u>I saw it on the news and I thought, that's the sort of thing Sam and Dean would investigate. They would roll into town, save the day, kill the monsters. But with them gone... I tried to work the case. I tried. (bitter little laugh) But... I don't know what I did wrong. I... I asked questions, but maybe they were the wrong people, or the wrong questions, and I just -- I never found it. Never found the monster. Never even got close. And three more women died before I left town. Before I ran away.</u>
>
> Mary: So we go back. You and me.
>
> Castiel: No. No, I'd only get in your way.

> Cass's phone rings in the bunker again, and he finally answers.
>
> Castiel: What?
>
> Dean: <u>Cass.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>(shocked) Dean?</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Hey, buddy. Long time.</u>
>
> Castiel: What... What happened? Wh-- where are you?
>
> Dean: You wouldn't believe me, and I have no clue. Uh...
>
> Sam: Got something. (looking from his map to the surrounding mountains) All right, looks like that's Elk Mountain, which makes that Long's Peak.
>
> Dean: (to Cass, on the phone) Okay, looks like we're in Colorado.
>
> Sam: In Rocky Mountain National Park. Uh, if we head north we should hit State Route 34. Eventually.
>
> Dean: (to Cass) Did you get that?
>
> Castiel: Yes.
>
> Dean: All right, meet us there.
>
> Castiel: Wait, where?
>
> Dean: Just drive along the road and you'll see us. And, Cass... We're kinda on the clock here.
>
> Dean hangs up.
>
> Castiel: Wait, what does that... (sighs)
>
> Sam: <u>You didn't tell him?</u>
>
> Dean: <u>No.</u>
>
> Sam: They'll track the phone.
>
> Dean: Right. (he throws the doctor's phone into the van and they both run off to the north through the woods)

> <u>Sam runs over to hug Mary, while Dean steps up to hug Cass.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Hey, buddy.</u>
>
> Dean then goes to hug Mary.

> Mary: (sniffles) I love you.
>
> Mary is about to pull the trigger when suddenly an angel blade pierces through Billie's chest from behind, and she falls down dead, revealing Cass behind her. <u>Everyone looks suitably shocked, including Cass.</u> Mary lowers her gun, and Sam and Dean get to their feet.
>
> Dean: Cass, what have you done?
>
> Castiel: <u>What had to be done. You know this world -- this sad, doomed little world -- it needs you. It needs every last Winchester it can get, and I will not let you die. I won't let any of you die. And I won't let you sacrifice yourselves. You mean too much to me. To everything. Yeah, you made a deal. You made a stupid deal, and I broke it. You're welcome.</u>
