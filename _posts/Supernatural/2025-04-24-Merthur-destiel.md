(-- Merlin 2x13, "The Last Dragonlord")

Oooo just ran into this and got reminded again how much love and hurt in merthur

Somehow can see Dean in Arthur, all wounded and bloody, but strong and such a leader. And Cas/Merlin is the one with all the magic, all powerful, but keeps everything to themselves. And immortal, had to wait by the lake for a thousand years for the mortal lover to come back.

Remember yesterday saw a post about Cas and Dean watching LotR together and they feel so related to the love between Aragorn/Arwen. The immortal gives up their immortality for the human lover.

Destiel should watch Merlin too, Cas would love Merlin.

Or Doctor Who, whether it's Doctor/Rose, Doctor/River, or any of Doctor's human companion/lover really, the immortals fall in love with this short-lived species, fall in love with this one human being that is so special they change their whole long immortal life

Love all of them. Guess that says so much about my type.

Usually the sad ending, angsty type.
