# Draft

## Prompt

**Prompt 5**: Character A and Character B fall in love while A perceives linear time forward and B jumps through time several times. This means A's first meeting with B is B's last meeting with A, and A's last meeting with B is B's first meeting with A.

**Translation 1**: (Dean=A, Cas=B) Dean and Cas fall in love while Dean perceives linear time forward and Cas jumps through time several times. This means Dean's first meeting with Cas is Cas's last meeting with Dean, and Dean's last meeting with Cas is Cas's first meeting with Dean.

Translation 2: (Cas=A, Dean=B) Dean and Cas fall in love while Cas perceives linear time forward and Dean jumps through time several times. This means Cas's first meeting with Dean is Dean's last meeting with Cas, and Cas's last meeting with Dean is Dean's first meeting with Cas.

## Initial inspirations

(inspired from S04E03/S05E13 "Time is fluid", AO3 story "A turn of the earth", DW刀河梗, recent "Agatha All Along"S01E07, Benjamin Burton)

Cas can't control where to land in time stream (a curse?), has to pop in time in reverse order, remember things in reverse order with Dean but still manages to fall in love. Both keeps journal to keep up, always run short in time.

"The First time I meet you is the last time you meet me"

"You'll see me again, but I'll never see you again"

401 Dean meets 1518 Cas, 1518 Dean meets 401 Cas

Cas moving backwards, remember him less by every time they met, Dean more

"Why do you act like it's our first kiss" (heartbroken to know it's the last for him)

"What you said to Amy, there's a worse day coming for you?" "When I first met the Doctor, a long, long time ago, he knew all about me. Think about that. Impressionable young girl and suddenly, this man just drops out of the sky. And he's clever and mad and wonderful and knows every last thing about her. Imagine what that does to a girl. Trouble is it's all back-to-front. My past is his future. We're traveling in opposite directions. Every time we meet, I know him more, he knows me less. **I live for the days when I see him**, but I know that every time I do, he'll be one step further away. And the day is coming when I'll look into that man's eyes, my Doctor, and he won't have the faintest idea who I am. And I think it's going to kill me." (S06E01)

"I take it we are close?" "Very." (OUAT)

"So all this time, you know exactly how I'd die"

keeps delaying to go to the last place he knows will be their last; has 10 years to think about how to fix this, why would he give him (something) → eventually saved his life
