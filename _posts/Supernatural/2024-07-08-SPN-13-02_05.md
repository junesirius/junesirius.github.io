> Dean hears a clacking sound coming from a distance. He follows the noise to Jack's room.
>
> Jack: Ah!
>
> Dean finds Jack trying to stab himself with a blade. The wounds immediately heal.
>
> Dean: Okay. What the hell? (he gets in the room) Give me that. You - Don't be an idiot. Look, A, this is not gonna do anything to you, okay? And B, you... What the hell?
>
> Jack: Exactly. What the hell am I? I can't control... whatever this is. I will hurt someone.
>
> Dean: You know, my brother thinks you can be saved.
>
> Jack: You don't believe that.
>
> Dean: No, I don't.
>
> Jack: So... if you're right?
>
> Dean: If I'm right... and it comes to killing you... I'll be the one to do it.
>
> Dean leaves.

> Sam: Okay, but why is it so hard? I've seen you throw people across the room. I've been thrown across the room by you. I've seen you open a gate to hell and now nothing? It doesn't make any sense.
>
> Jack: It makes sense, if I'm evil.
>
> Sam: What?
>
> Jack: Just, go. Please.
>
> Sam: No, Jack. <u>Why do you think you're evil? Because when I look at you, that's not what I see.</u>
>
> Jack: Yeah well, Dean sees it. That's why he says... he said he'd kill me.
>
> Sam: <u>He what?</u>
>
> Jack: And maybe he should. Mom said I could be good, that I had the choice to be good, that it was up to me. But she's dead, because of me. I've only been on earth for a few days and I've already hurt people. I've already done bad things, and no matter how hard I try I can't... I can't do the one good, stupid thing you want me to. So I must be evil, like Lucifer.
>
> Sam: Jack, listen, Asmodeus tricking you, Dean, <u>none of that is your fault.</u> I think that uh, after everything that's happened you're probably scared to use your power, and me pressuring you certainly isn't helping.
>
> Jack: Really?
>
> Sam: Really. What do you say we call it? Until I figure out a better way. How does that sound?
>
> Jack: It sounds... good.
>
> Sam: Good. Come on.
>
> Sam offers his hand to Jack, who takes it and stands up.
>
> Jack: Sam, why are you being so nice to me?
>
> Sam: <u>Because I know what it feels like, to feel like you don't belong. To feel like there's this darkness inside of you, to be scared of who you are, what you can do. Dean, Cass, my family helped me through that.</u> So now I want to help you, because you're not evil, Jack.

> Sam: How was it? Uh, Jody told me about Missouri.
>
> Dean: Yeah, just another day at the office. How's the kid? He go dark side yet?
>
> Sam: Nope. He is uh, he's pretty messed up though.
>
> Sam has turned in his chair so he is facing Dean.
>
> Dean: You're telling me.
>
> Sam: No, Dean. <u>He's messed up because of you. Dean, you said you'd kill him.</u>
>
> Dean: It wasn't exactly like that.
>
> Sam: Then how exactly was it?
>
> Dean: I told him the truth. See, you think you can use this freak but I know how this ends and it ends bad.
>
> The camera pans and we see Jack outside the room, listening to the boys' conversation.
>
> Sam: <u>I didn't.</u>
>
> Dean: What?
>
> Sam: <u>I didn't "end bad". When I was the freak, when I was drinking demon blood.</u>
>
> Sam is standing up and moving towards Dean.
>
> Dean: Come on man, that's totally different.
>
> Sam: <u>Was it? Because you could've put a bullet in me. Dad told you to put a bullet in me, but you didn't! You saved me! So help me save him!</u>
>
> Dean: <u>You deserved to be saved, he doesn't!</u>
>
> Sam: Yes he does, Dean, of course he does!
>
> Jack is still eavesdropping outside the room.
>
> Dean: Look, I know you think that you can use him as some sort of an interdimensional can-opener and that's fine, but don't act like you care about him! Because you only care about what he can do for you! So if you want to pretend, that's fine! But me? <u>I can hardly look at the kid! Because when I do all I see is everybody we've lost!</u>
>
> Sam: Mom chose to take that shot at Lucifer. That is not on Jack!
>
> Dean: <u>And what about Cass?</u>
>
> Sam: What about Cass?
>
> Dean: <u>He manipulated him, he made him promises, said, 'paradise on earth' and Cass bought it and you know what that got him? It got him dead! Now you might be able to forget about that, but I can't!</u>
>
> <u>Jack looks distressed outside the room.</u>
>
> Jack: <u>Castiel.</u>
>
> Jack'S eyes glow gold.

> Jack is watching "Star Wars: The Clone Wars" on his computer.
>
> Sam: "Clone Wars"?
>
> Jack: The computer said I'd like it. <u>I do like Ahsoka. Kinda hate Anakin.</u>
>
> Sam: <u>Uh... that's probably for the best.</u>

> Dean: You said you wanted to give this a shot, right? Here we go. He won't even admit that Mom's dead. Won't even admit it.
>
> Sam: Stop.
>
> Dean: <u>Because if he admits it, then it's real. If it's real, then he has to deal with it, and he can't handle that.</u>
>
> Sam: Right, because this is so easy for you, uh?
>
> Dean: No, it's not easy.
>
> Sam: Yeah, <u>but at least you had a relationship with Mom. I mean, who would she always call? Who did she look to for everything?</u>
>
> Dean: Okay.
>
> Sam: <u>You had something with her I never had! And now I'm just supposed to accept that I never will have it?</u>
>
> Sam leaves the room, slams the door behind him.

> Dean hands Sam a bottle of beer.
>
> Dean: <u>Listen, man, back at, uh, Mia's, I was out of line. I'm sorry for being a... a dick lately.</u>
>
> Sam: Thanks.
>
> Dean: And maybe you're right, about the kid. I mean, he tries. I'll give him that. And he tapped his powers, saved our ass, so that's a win.
>
> Sam: Yeah. I guess.
>
> Dean: What's up?
>
> Sam: What if you're right? About Mom. What if she is dead, and I'm just in denial?
>
> Dean: <u>Don't say that.</u>
>
> Sam: What? You've been wanting me to admit that since it happened.
>
> Dean: <u>I know I have, but don't say that. I need you to keep the faith, for both of us. 'Cause right now, I... Right now, I don't believe in a damn thing.</u>

> Sam: So, strip club?
>
> Dean: Wait. Sorry. What?
>
> Sam: (stammering) Mm, s-strip... club. There's one just outside of town, the, uh... Clamdiver.
>
> Dean: You wanna go to the Clamdiver?
>
> Sam: Yeah. It - it got great reviews.
>
> Dean: You read reviews for the Clamdiver?
>
> Sam: (still stammering) It - it - it got four and a half --
>
> Dean: Dude, what is going on with you?
>
> Sam: What are you talking about?
>
> Dean: <u>All day. You give me a-a beer for breakfast. You - you gave me Agent Page, which you always like to be. You - you didn't whine about me blaring my music the whole way here. And when we stopped for lunch, you ordered my chili fries.</u>
>
> Sam: You love chili fries.
>
> Dean: Everybody loves chili fries. That's not the point. Now you wanna go hang out at a strip club? You hate strip clubs.
>
> Sam: (scoffing) No I don't.
>
> Dean: Dude the last lap dance you had - was - was at Christmas. It was a gift paid for by me. You spent the entire song trying to convince the girl that she should go to nursing school. <u>So what is it? Is it my birthday? Did - did I win a bet that I don't know about? What?</u>
>
> Sam: No, nothing. Nothing. <u>I - I mean, I'm just trying to be nice.</u>
>
> Dean: Why?
>
> Sam: Because... (deep sigh) You know why.
>
> Dean: I'm fine.
>
> Sam: <u>No, you're not, Dean. (Dean turns to enter the hotel, Sam follows) You said you don't believe in anything and - and that's... that's not true. That's not you. You - you - you do believe in things. You believe in people. That's who you are. That's what you do. I know you're in a dark place, and I-I just want to help.</u>
>
> Dean: Okay. Look, I-I've been down this road before and I fought my way back. I will fight my way back again.
>
> Sam: How?
>
> Dean: Same way I always do - bullets, bacon, and booze. (rings front desk bell) A lotta booze.

> Dean: Easy. (opens metal box and holds up two large syringes) One needle stops the heart, the other one starts it up again.

> Billie: And...
>
> Dean: No, I saw Cass kill you.
>
> Billie: How's that working out for him? It's funny to hear a Winchester talk about the finality of dying. This reality - it has rules, Dean. So many rules. And one of them? <u>Kill one incarnation of Death, like you did, the next Reaper to dies takes his place.</u> So... when Castiel stabbed me in the back, turns out, I got a promotion. (We see Billie's hand with a white stoned ring, very similar to the ring Death wore) New job. New gear.
>
> Dean: So you died to become Death?
>
> Billie: This universe can be so many things, and sometimes, it is poetic. That's why we need to talk.
>
> Dean is suddenly standing in the black and white corridor of shelves with Billie.
>
> Dean: The hell?
>
> Billie: Welcome to my reading room. Know not to leave this lying around near you. Don't we?
>
> Billie leans her scythe against the wall.
>
> Dean: <u>So... am I dead?</u>
>
> Billie: You killed yourself.
>
> Dean: <u>No. Are you keeping me dead?</u>
>
> Billie: Now that depends on you.
>
> Dean: Okay. Uh... Well, congrats on the promotion. Uh, but I got a house full of ghosts waiting on me and my brother to get back to, so if it's up to me --
>
> Billie: I didn't say it was up to you. I said it depends on you. Word on the interdimensional street is you've been slipping between worlds, Dean. I wanna know how you did it. Now.
>
> Dean: Well, I thought Death knew everything.
>
> Billie: Then you can imagine how this one little blind spot is really bothering me.
>
> Dean: <u>What's in it for me?</u>
>
> Billie: What do you want?
>
> Dean: Free the ghosts.
>
> Billie: Excuse me?
>
> Dean: Free the ghosts at the Meadow's house. Let them move on, I'll tell you whatever you wanna know.
>
> Billie: Deal. It's done.
>
> Dean: How do I know I can trust you?
>
> Billie: You don't. <u>But then again, I'm not the one breaking cosmic bargains left and right, now, am I?</u>
>
> Dean: Yeah, it's not like you to hold a grudge.
>
> Billie: Don't I? So... spill.
>
> Dean: Lucifer's son. Jack. When he was born, it created a little rip.
>
> Billie: "A little rip"?
>
> Dean: Mm.
>
> Billie: Into another world? And you went there?
>
> Dean: Mm. Yeah, I'll just say it's, uh, it's not Candy Land.
>
> Billie: I'll bet.
>
> Dean: Why do you care?
>
> Billie: Because I do. <u>Because... this whole multi-versal quantum construct we live in, it's like a house of cards. And the last thing I need is some big, dumb Winchester knocking it all down.</u>
>
> Dean: Hmm. <u>That does sound like us.</u>
>
> Billie: <u>You've changed. When you bargained with me just now, you could've asked to go back, to live.</u>
>
> Dean: Well, <u>I figured with you in charge, there's no getting back for me.</u>
>
> Billie: <u>That doesn't sound like the Dean Winchester I know and love.</u> The man who has been dead so many times but it never seems to stick. Maybe you're not that guy anymore, they guy who saves the world, the guy who always thinks he'll win no matter what. <u>You have changed. And you tell people it's not a big deal. You tell people you'll work through it but you know you won't. You can't and that scares the hell out of you.</u> Or... am I wrong?
>
> Dean: What do you want me to say? Doesn't matter. <u>I don't matter.</u>
>
> Billie: Don't you?
>
> Dean: <u>I couldn't save Mom. I couldn't save Cass. I can't even save a scared little kid. Sam keeps trying to fix it, but I just keep dragging him down. So I'm not going to beg. Okay, if it's my time, it's my time.</u>
>
> Billie: You really believe that. (Dean nods his head yes) <u>You wanna die.</u> Dean... every notebook on this particular shelf tells a version of how you die. You specifically. Heart attack, burned by a red-haired witch, stabbed by a ghoul in a graveyard, and on and on. But which one's right? That depends on you, on the choices you make.
>
> Dean: Well, <u>I guess I made my choice.</u>
>
> Billie: <u>But... unfortunately none of these books say you die today.</u>
>
> Dean: Come again?
>
> Billie: Since I got this... new job, I stand witness to a much larger picture. Do you know what I see? <u>You. And your brother. You're important.</u>
>
> Dean: Why?
>
> Billie: <u>You have work to do.</u> That's all you need to know. And trust me, having my eyes opened to the necessity of any humans, especially Winchesters, is not a thrill. <u>So... you wanna die, but I say... keep living.</u>
