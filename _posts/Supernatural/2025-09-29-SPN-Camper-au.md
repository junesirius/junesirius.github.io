(Camp owner!Dean x Wayward kid caretaker!Cas)

(Inspired by [Original Post](https://www.tumblr.com/junesirius/796088354358837248))

> AU where Dean is a camp owner in the forest. He took over the family business with his little brother Sam after their father died. Their mom died when they were young, but she and John had started to build this business together. It was their dream but it was different once she was gone. Dean had to take care of Sam while John was too busy keeping it alive for Mary. He buried himself in work and booze. And that's probably what killed him.
>
> Cas takes care of a group of troubled teens abandoned by their parents for who they are. He was one too and that's how he met his coworker, Meg, who decided one day that they all should go to that camp lost in the middle of the woods. Cas doesn't think this is a good idea but goes anyway after Meg insisted.
>
> When that day comes, he meets Dean there. He's a little rough but he's nice to the kids and he's nice to Cas after some time. Dean understands those kids Cas brought, as an old troubled teen himself and taking care of one too. He knows how they feel.
>
> What he doesn't know is how he feels about Cas.

And Dean initially mistakes Meg and Cas to be together, which makes him even more hesitant and confused about his own feeling. He feels jealous when Meg hits on Cas, and confused about his own bitter sour reactions.

Cas feels for Dean, but seeing Dean doesn't make a move, he thinks Dean isn't interested. So he too buries his feelings, but the longing and yearning is right there. All those kids he's been taking care of can see it. And one of those kids, is Claire.

So Claire tries to secretly help Dean realizes Cas's feeling and vice versa, but just purely coincidentally and unfortunately, something happened in the woods. Might be getting lost after dark when she wanders too far, might be a sudden appearance of some wild creatures like bear or wolf endangering the camp, might be a sudden sharp drop of temperature at night or heavy rain fall. Anyway, something happened, Claire is in trouble, so Cas is determined to go out to find her and save her, thinking it's his responsibility, even though they all know it's far too dangerous to go out there in a situation like this. Cas doesn't care, he's desperate to get Claire back.

And Dean, instead of trying to persuade him to stay, proposes them go out together to search and rescue Claire together. Cas falls for him even more by every minute in critical moments like this, but now isn't really a good time for he to think about feelings.

They go out there, it's dark, it's wet, slippery, dangerous, full of wild animals or unknown dangers. They hold each other's hands for support, walk in the dark woods for a whole night, grasping each other tight, leaning into each other closely. They don't talk much during these intense moments, but both cling to each other, rely on each other to survive this, trust each other with their lives even though they didn't talk about any of that. They already know their feelings well enough by now. In the coldest moment of the night, they hold each other tight for heat, they hug for long quiet moments, then keep moving on.

By the time the sun is up, they get out of the dangerous zone or that critical situation, and they find Claire. She's mostly safe, but with some small trouble, like maybe a sprained ankle or accidentally drop into some deep cave/trap-like place, not in immediate danger, but difficult to get out.

So Dean and Cas have to really be creative to figure out something quickly from whatever they have by hans, making use of the plants and vines and any wild resources they can find close by to make a rope or some kind of rescue solution. During the process, both of their knowledge amaze the other and compensate what the other wouldn't know alone, like knowledge of the wild creature and plants and nature (mostly from Cas) and military-level outdoor survival skills (mostly from Dean) combine and collaborate perfectly together, just like how perfectly fit and comfortable when they're with each other.

So together, they figure out a plan and strategy to get Claire back to safe place. But then accident happens again, right when Claire is about to be dragged out, someone slips or the land just happen to have a slippery spot or the rope can't bear the weight and loosens or something, someone (like either Claire or Dean) is about to get hurt, in that split second, Cas throws himself in, like grabbing the other end of the rope or use his own body for Claire to be the last step to get out. So Claire is out safe but Cas is falling quickly.

Dean instinctively reaches out to grab his hand, so Cas hangs by the edge of the cliff (or some deep cave or trap), the only thing keeping him hanging there is Dean's hand. Dean grabs him so tightly but he's getting exhausted quickly, arms start trembling, but he still doesn't let go. And Cas can see that. Cas knows no way Dean can pull him up by his own strength, the longer he doesn't let go, the more danger he's putting Dean, he might even drag Dean into the pit.

So, teary, but calmly, Cas tells Dean to let go.

Dean cries no.

Cas says it's okay. He accepts it.

Dean says no. He can't lose him without ever even knowing how's it like to have him.

They only really spend a night together, and that's not really even fully together.

Cas smiles to him, a little pale, but smiling, telling him he already have him. And that Dean should let go, for his own sake. And that he loves him.

Cas loosens his hand before Dean can answer. Dean's hand is too sweaty and weak to grab him, so Cas falls. Dean cries, in pain and aching.

But this isn't the end.

The sun gets up, help is on the way. Claire gets in contact with Meg, who gathers the rescue team or Dean's company emergency team in the wood, they come to help. Dean should be out there coordinating his crew, as he had done before, when other campers needed help in the past. There are procotols and procedures, but now Dean forgets all about his training, only standing guarded right where he lost Cas.

The profesional rescue team comes, Dean guides them to the place, insists to wear the gears and outfits to go down there as well. Those people are still following his lead, he tries very hard to keep himself composed, and goes to rescue Cas.

He finds Cas at the bottom of the pit, no big issue, minor wounds maybe.

Dean: "You scared the hell out of me."

Cas just looks at him in the eyes: "I'm sorry, Dean. I didn't mean to make you worry."

Dean just can't say anything but hug him tight and kiss him, kiss him like his life depends on it.

Dean: "Please don't ever do crap like that again. Don't make me lose you again."

And Dean tells Cas he loves him too.

They get back out safely together, get back to the camp. Claire gets her minor injuries attended too. Everyone is taken care of.

Dean holds Cas's hand when they go back camp, or maybe even princess-carries him if Cas happened to get a sprained ankle during the process. Meg looks at them with raised eyebrows, Dean just beams like an idiot under the sunshine, Cas smiles shily.

Meg laughs: "Idiots." Then takes a photo of them.

A photo they keep in their bedroom bedstand even long after.

Now this morning Dean wakes up and turns on his bed naturally and comfortably to kiss his huband out of habit, his husband who he has married for ten years. He catches a glimpse at the photo again and deliberately asks if he still remembers that day.

Cas answers how can he not. He was attracted by Dean the moment he laid eyes on Dean. And jokes that Dean was acting funny when he thought Cas was with Meg.

Dean: "Not my fault to think this gorgeous is loved by *everyone*." and continues kissing Cas.

Cas in the moddle of their kiss: "You think I'm beautiful?" He's totally saying that deliberately.

Dean rolls his eyes dramatically: "Did I not tell you that enough in the past ten years?"

They laugh and kiss and share little "You're beautiful" and "I love you" in between.

Then Claire breaks into their room to say she's heading out, with friends or outing or something, and is grossed out by the toothrottenly sweetness she accidentally runs into.

Claire regrets: "I should have knocked. I'm out."

Her two dads (Cas): "Take care."

Dean yells from bed: "You back home for dinner?"

Claire: "Maybe not." (She's actually out to date Kaia and her two dads somehow figure that out.)

Dean: "You can bring her home. I don't mind cook for four."

Claire already out of door but laughs loudly and happily: "Alright then."

The end. (They all live happily ever after.)
