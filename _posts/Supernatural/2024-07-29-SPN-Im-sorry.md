\# Summary: Dean is a dick. Cass needs saving.

\# Notes:

I want to punish Dean for being such a dick, so I tortured Cass to torture him. So the title is also from me to Cass, "I'm sorry, Cass."

I had the story idea after I watched S15E02, and then when I was still planning it, I watched S15E03, and I regretted not writing this down sooner. I want to un-see it. The breakup scene and the sacrifice of Rowena hurt me so badly that I forgot half the juicy content I was initially imagining for this story. Dean needs to apologize to me.

And for anyone who gets hurt by reading this story, the title is my words to you too.

There might be some sequel(s) to this, but I can't guarantee. Not unless people want to see it.

<br>

When they finally get back to the bunker, everyone is exhausted. Solving world-level crisis tends to have that effect.

Leading the way down the stairs towards the bunker main hall, Sam says, with a relieved grin, "I'm actually still surprised it worked. I mean, I know Rowena is the best witch in the world, I didn't expect her crystalline device could actually absorb all the souls from the Hell."

"Yeah she's fucking awesome lately," Dean agrees, with a small approval smile, "with the rupture to the hell and the door to the other world and all that, I'll give you that."

Cass follows them, nodding, "I'm glad she's on our side now, her powers are being very useful."

"Certainly more useful than you are recently." Dean says abruptly.

Cass stuns, stopping on the middle of the stairs, choked, eyes wide.

"Dude!" Sam snaps, looking back to stare at his brother, frowning, "What's that about?"

Dean holds the stare, not looking at Cass' gaze on him, speaks in a matter-of-fact tone, "What? Just telling the fact, Rowena built the crystalline, Jack-slash-Belphegor closed the rupture, we were busy killing ghosts and soothing people, what did he do? Let me see. Oh, he told the family what happened to the wife so that two other civilians could sneak in and get themselves attacked and almost died. Nice work!" He shoots a stern glance at Cass, continues the smooth movement of shoving the gear bag underneath the table, taking off the jacket, and ready to grab a drink.

Cass stutters weakly, voice hurt, "I-I thought that's for their best. They deserve to know... I didn't mean to... "

"Yeah, not so much. Probably next time don't think, just ask. Apparently your judgement of what's best is never right." Dean cuts in harshly, already heading towards the kitchen before finish his sentence, leaving only his back for Cass.

Cass stares at his back, thinking about following into the kitchen, but on second thought, he stops. Just standing in the middle of the empty hall, staring at the map on the center table, not knowing what to do.

*You are useless to us.*

*You are dead to me.*

*You never make the right choice.*

He can hear the echo of Dean's voice still circling in the air, or maybe it's in the back of his head, like a spiral wave of dark demonic smoke. He closes his eyes, only seeing Dean's furious face staring at him, finger pointing, teeth clenching, growling about how he killed his mother, the mother that he never had and now forever lost again. His breaths quickens, heart drops and pounds heavily.

He never want any of these to happen. He never wants to cause them pain. He only wants to help, wants to be of use for the Winchesters, to protect them, save them, even if it costs his life. But apparently, he has done an awful job.

More times than usual, they are the ones cover his ass, they are the ones who have to protect him and save him. He is nothing more than a burden now, and Dean's words have made that point pretty clear.

Castiel smiles bitterly at himself, coming to the realization and finally facing this hard truth that he doesn't want to admit for a long time, ever since he lost Jack and Mary, or before that when he lost his wings and caused the Fall, or even before that when he devoured the Leviathans and slaughtered half the Heaven, or broke the wall in Sam's mind, or almost killed Dean for the angel tablet, or beat them up for trying to force them to say yes to Michael and Lucifer. He loses count of his mistakes. What a failure he is, he thinks to himself, can't even do this one thing right. He has one job and one job only -- be Winchesters' guardian angel. But he has never really guard them well against dooming dangers, and he's not even much of an angel left now.

There doesn't seem to be many reasons to continue hanging around anymore. Castiel looks around the bunker, eyes running down the books in the library, those slightly beeping machines in the corner of the war room, the sigils on the corridor and walls, the bottles and jars of magical ingredients on the far end of the shelves in the storage room. He takes them all in, engraving them to the memory, knowing that this is the closest to a home he has ever had in the billions of years of his life and that he will never come back again pretending he is still part of the family. He swallows difficultly, forcing back the wetness in the eyes. He doesn't deserve to get sentimental, he tells himself, since he's the one that messes everything up.

Maybe go tell the brothers one last farewell before taking off? Castiel considers, just so that they won't think he decides to bail on them or random MIA like the other times that he got abducted. He walks slowly towards the kitchen, thinking about the words he's gonna say to them, not purposefully keeping the footsteps quiet, but stops by the corridor when he hears the arguments and his name from the kitchen.

Sam's soft voice is saying, "What's wrong with you two? Really no need to be so mean to Cass."

Dean's voice answers, impatiently, "Nothing. Why the hell do you make it sound like my fault? I'm not the one started ghost-zombie-pocalypse."

"Neither is Cass!" Sam counters, speaking quickly, "You've been blaming him for everything, for Mom, for Jack, for Chuck. Dude's been doing nothing but giving his everything to us since the beginning, I don't even want to think about how many times he had died for us, don't you think he deserves at least a little respect?"

Dean murmurs something under his breath, Cass can't quite make it out from the distance. The sound is followed by empty glass hitting the table, refrigerator door opening and closing, and bottle lid flying open. Castiel hesitates whether this would be a good moment to walk in, when Dean starts talking again. So he waits.

"He needs to earn it." Dean says, fiercely, "The trust, the respect, all of it. He ruined them too damn many times he'll have to build it from scratch again."

Castiel flinches in pain, feeling his heart get stung by a needle right through the center, and then freeze to absolute zero. He knows he messed up, but he never know how Dean really sees it -- see him -- and now he knows the answer: Dean stops respecting him, stops trusting him, like he said himself, he's dead to him. Castiel closes his eyes, breathing long and slowly, trying to ease the pain, but nothing helps. He can almost see his heart -- or his Grace, whatever metaphorical spiritual central core that bears the weight of feelings and emotions -- curls up to a small blob, as if a human huddles themselves to the smallest for self-protection.

"You're just impossible to reason with when you are in this you-are-pissed-because-the-whole-world-owes-you mode, you know that?" Even Sam's voice is hitching now, cold anger slowly bubbling up but still in control. "Cass. Is. Family. Cass is our brother." Sam says slowly, word by word, syllable by syllable, emphasized. "In case you forget, he's the one pulled you from the Hell."

"Now that you say that, I've been rethinking about that as well." Dean's voice pierces through the corridor, coldly puncturing into the angel's ear, tearing apart an already wounded heart. "You see, God planned all those shit, right? So it can be any angel to fetch me, he just so happened to send Cass. But it doesn't have to be him, so whatever 'bound' we had, it's just all random shit that the asshole maybe suddenly come up with when he's using toilet. As far as I can tell, we are all just pawns, and the only family I really have is you."

"Ok, you know what, that's enough. I have enough of your bullshit for a day." Sam says wearily. There is sound of chair legs moving on the floor. "I'm gonna get back to my room. Feel free to knock yourself out."

Some mumbles and sound of glass moving on the desk is all Dean's answer.

The corridor is empty by the time Sam walks out of the kitchen. So is the hall or the library or the war room.

"Cass?" Sam calls out for a few times, but the angel is nowhere to be found.

Maybe he went out for some air or me time, Sam thinks to himself, can't blame the guy for not wanting to stay under the same roof with Dean after taking so much of his bullshit. If Cass wants some time away, he can totally understand.

Decided to put off any problem to the next day, Sam texts Cass, simply asking "you ok?" and goes to bed. He blacks out almost instantly, without waiting for an answer. This has been a long day for him.

Dean's day ends in a few hours with more empty bottles and a dizzy mushy head banging onto the table.

As for Cass, right now the angel is in a car, on a highway, in the middle of a night, hitting 100 mph, racing away from Lebanon, Kansas.

His knuckles are white around the wheels, eyes looking into the road ahead so long without blinking that they starts watering. Castiel is making every effort of his body to prevent his teeth from shuddering. There is no music on in the car, because every mixtape is made by Dean, would remind him of Dean. But so is the car itself, or the pistol on the shotgun seat, or his own trenchcoat and suit and shirt, or even his own existence now would remind him of Dean. He wants to think about anything else frantically, but all he can hear is Dean's voice, all he can see is Dean's face. Castiel finds himself already unable to tell the difference between the reality, or his memory, or his imagination.

He sees Dean walking on the road in front of his car, wearing a vicious smile, asking him, "Is this what you do? Being a cry baby? I thought you are stronger than this." He didn't notice when the tears come, but by the time his hands wipe on his own face, it's all soaked wet.

He sees Dean sitting next to him, looking at him up and down, mocking, "So you're an angel? Are all the angels so pathetic? So weak? So useless?"

He hears him saying, loud and clear, "You mean nothing to me. You're powerless. You're a burden."

And also, repeatedly, round and round again, "You're dead to me. You're dead to me. You're dead to me..."

Castiel doesn't know for how long he has been holding breath, to stop the wail. Angels don't need to breath, but he finds himself out of breath now. The vessel -- or maybe it's already becoming himself -- is out of breath and dizzy for lack of oxygen. Trembling all over due to the silent sobbing. But he still nails his feet on the pedal, wishing to drive as fast as possible. Out, away, anywhere, nowhere. But however fast the vehicle gets, it still seems to be too slow. Too slow, so that all the sorrow is catching up, all the pain and hurt is catching up, like a demon army chasing behind him and he's trying to drive away from it but there is no chance of winning.

The worst of all is memory. All the memory from past ten years is flooding inside his brain. He used to believe the angel brain is like a gigantic organized data center, the amount of memory and knowledge is so vast that humans cannot even start to imagine. He has memories from billions of years ago, and knowledge about the whole universe, but all those seem to be so insignificant compared with the memories and experiences he shared with humans, with the Winchesters, with... Dean. With all the joy and all the bitterness, all the laughter and all the tears, he used to think it's the best part of his life, the part that fundamentally changed who he is -- or rather, finally find out who he is. But now. Now he doesn't know the answer again. Who is he without the Winchesters? Who is he without Dean? Who is he without the mission and task and all the purpose of his life to protect the brothers?

He used to appreciate the human emotions. The way they laugh or cry, it's so fascinating that he can stares for ages from above. And when he finally gets to walk the Earth and experience them, Castiel used to still feel grateful about everything he feels, the sorrow, the happiness, each win and each lose, he feels with the hunters together, like he is actually a part of something bigger, a part of family. But not anymore. Now all he can feel is pain, endless overwhelming pain. The uselessness, the abandonment, the frustration -- the pain, they are just all different kinds of pain, the numbing pain, the sharp pain, the pain that constantly lurks at the edge of the brain and bites on the cortex, the pain that like waves comes and goes with a rhythm and pattern...

Castiel realizes the human language is so pale that there is not enough vocabulary to explain or describe what is happening to him, the Enochian expression is even less about emotions or feelings. Pain is the only thing he can feel right now, burning from inside to outside. The heart is the center of the wild fire, shattered, bloodied, he believes he has never hurt so badly in a battlefield. He doesn't even know a being can endure that much pain but still breathing.

His breath is sharp, every time the air flowing in and out, the whole lung and chest hurts. As time goes by, he can barely feel his heart bumping inside this human body, as if the heart is made of crystal and Dean's words being the hammer that smashed it to pieces and dusts, and the dusts are slightly blowing away until there is nothing left inside his chest.

"There are only three things in the whole universe can permanently kill an angel."

It is then that Castiel starts to remember the saying he had heard when he was newly created and merely a small seraph. The three things are: holy fire, angel blade, and heartbroken.

He knows how to protect himself from the first two, but the third one, he never saw it coming. And now, there is nowhere to escape. He knows what is coming for him next.

By the time he runs out of oil and the last penny in the pocket, he is a thousand miles away from the bunker, in the middle of nowhere. He climbs out of the car, looking around at the mountains and trees. Iowa isn't the best place to say goodbye, but also not the worst.

(settings: Cass is so desperate that he uses the old way to shut down his whole own system, deleting every cell and grace and his existence, once this done, he won't be dead and go into void, he will cease to exist, there is no coming back, he's so desperate that he makes sure he can't be resurrect again; the reset button can restore him to factory setting, as if the billion years of walking on earth and with them never happened, but at least he won't die, Dean: and maybe he'll even be happier; Dean use the mind hacker device to drill inside Cass' brain, look for the reset button, Cass is screaming pain in Enochian, Crowley is translating, mostly "help""stop please", until "Dean", Crowley: "that doesn't need translation", Dean crying: "I'm sorry" and hug; ending: Cass comes back, reset to billions of years ago, no memory of them, "Who are you", "I know you, from the Plan", "I'm Castiel, an angel of the Lord", Dean: this time, maybe better if they never know each other, at least he won't hurt Cass so much again that he'll kill himself)
