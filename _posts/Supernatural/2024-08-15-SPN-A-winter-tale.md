看完了NorthernSparrow老师的《A Winter's Tale》，心疼死文里的小卡了，今天也是丁温不干人事的一天。没忍住留了长评，这里也存一份。

因为正好自己最近也在新城市找租房，就特意留意了一下流程，感觉真的是写得过于现实甚至开始感到不适了。没有id没有job没法做income verification或者reference的人，真的几乎完全没有可能租到地方住或者找到工作啊，小卡能找到加油站营业员的活干已经很难想象他到底怎么做到的了，不得不睡在stock room是真的他作为新变成的人类没法改变的。心疼死了。

This fic is so beautifully and realistically written. I can relate so much to being a foreigner in this country, I have been here for five years but I still feel I don't understand quite a lot of delicate culture-specific human interaction skills. Very frequently I feel I will never fit in. I know too well about that sense of out-of-place, so I love Cas even more whenever he shows that out-of-place trait. It's not the nerdiness, it's just what being an outsider is like. I feel comforted somehow, if an angel finds it difficult to fit in, then at least I'm not alone, I'm not the only one feeling that way.

Also, it just so happened that I myself have been looking for a place to live lately, and this has become more and more of an anxiety and urgency, so the part of the story when Cas was doing the house-hunting, it just feels so realistic and even more hurting than it should be.

I'm so happy Cas is finally home, warm and comfortable, surrounded and loved by his family. I agree with Dean that it still feels too little too late, that time of suffering is never going to be wiped from Cas's memory even if he recovers or becomes an angel again. But Cas being Cas, he is always so forgiving, so he would of course forgive Dean, even if the miserable memory would sometimes still haunt him. I'm imagining maybe long after the event, he would still suffer in a nightmare as if he is still cold and starving and sleeping in the park, and he would mumble the hurting "Can I come back, I can be useful" in his dream talk, and Dean would hear that, and continue to beat himself up in his own mind knowing that the damage would never ever really get fixed, only time can wash it and patch it very slowly.
