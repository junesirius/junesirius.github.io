(Jimmy POV)

## Idea

### Raw inspiration

(quoted, not original)

这是一个没有温家兄弟的世界，所以Cas来地球的目的不是为了救righteous man而是为了apocalypse战争做准备。这个世界的Jimmy设定没有变，但因为Cas目的变了，所以他们的磨合其实并不好。

Jimmy尝试反抗过很多次。Cas一开始会亲自警告他，后来有一次选择直接离开了Jimmy。Jimmy以为自己自由了，但他的身体已经被天使grace折磨得不太好了。他在逃跑途中被其他天使发现抓了回去，天使说这就是Castiel说的不听话的vessel啊，要不要我们帮Castiel解决这个麻烦呢。就开始折磨Jimmy

因为太痛苦了，Jimmy忍不住在想，Castiel会回来吗，对我需要惩罚到如此地步吗？我什么都给他了，难道连我的良知和思想，都要彻底交托么？Castiel你不会这样的吧？

本来也只是普通的折磨而已，在天使提出要不直接弄坏他的大脑，让他有说yes的意识但没有深度思考的能力的时候，Castiel还是回来了，而且还是穿着Claire回来的。他看了Jimmy一眼，把折磨Jimmy的天使都揍了一遍。但根本上还是觉得，其他天使无权为他决定Jimmy的任何事。

之后他把Jimmy带到了一个单独的废弃房间，让Jimmy休息。但Jimmy不愿意休息，只是反复观察Claire。Castiel说“这是你的女儿，我知道。我遇到她时她在战区边缘，受伤很严重。”过了一会儿补充，“我把她治好了。就算我离开，她也会继续活着。”只是没有任何意义，因为缺乏生存能力的人都会死——只不过他没说出口。

Claire的外套是烂的，看起来被战火轰炸过。但内衬姑且被恢复了一些，保留了一些体面，但Jimmy无法为此感到欣慰。

昏暗的房间内沉默了很久，Jimmy的思绪开始飘散。他开始思考这里在被战火波及之前是否曾是不错的旅店，现在这房间外又有多少天使，又或者这是Castiel的秘密基地外面并没有其他人——怎么可能呢，他早就知道Castiel不是他以为的那个独特的天使了，他是个冷血的士兵。他也不会想逃跑了，Castiel离开他的这么些天内他的神经从来没有停止过疼痛，他知道他跑不掉，也跑不远。

也许Castiel重新附身他就不会再疼了，他也不愿意让Castiel穿着他年幼的女儿上战场，可是他应当如何开口，如何邀请苦难和噩梦重新拥抱他？

无眠了一晚上，第二天Jimmy还是在Castiel来看他时说了，“用我，别用我的女儿。把我女儿放在安全的地方吧，我不会再质疑，更不会再反抗，我完全是你的了。”

Castiel把Claire带到了战区外的荒林里，重新转移到Jimmy身上。他确实也不想用一个年幼女孩的身体。而在他重新进入Jimmy的时候，Jimmy在想，他进来后我的神经确实不疼了。

之后就像是深度睡眠，偶尔Jimmy会被神经上隐约的疼痛惊醒，意识朦胧地看见自己身处各种险境，比如身体被撕碎，半边脑袋被炮火炸散。放在人类身上一定是会死的伤势，似乎也只够让天使的grace与他的意识短暂失调不到半秒。

偶尔他也想过反抗，想过趁乱挣扎，但又会有一瞬间犹豫：“如果不是我，那么Castiel下一个vessel会是谁”

但有时候又不一样，Castiel没有受伤，他只是……躺在一个像手术台一样的地方。Jimmy觉得不疼，他想站起来，但做不到。他摸摸脑袋，发现铁圈罩着他的额头，脑袋上都是深深浅浅的钉子。他的手在控制不住地颤抖。

随后他就被这个骇人的事实吓晕过去。晕过去的感觉像在坠落，他似乎在坠回谷底之前看见了Castiel，天使的意识被那些入脑的长钉固定，多余的羽毛被剪去，翅膀内测所剩无几的柔软绒羽寸寸枯萎，余下的每一根羽毛都像冷硬的金属片。

最后一次醒来是Castiel死的时候，Jimmy没弄清楚情况，只是随着Castiel的垂死意识越发清楚了。他感觉疼痛，不再是神经的疼痛而是无处不在，天使垂死不受控制的grace焚化了他的内脏，烧焦了他的眼球……但在死前他看到了穿着风衣的天使，他没有搞清楚情况，他只模糊地感觉到，“Castiel”在杀他。不过在某种意义上，他或许早就死了

最后一点意识是在虚无里，Jimmy在漫无边际的黑暗中行走，感觉不到疼痛也感觉不到任何情绪，或者说是被各种负面情绪压垮已经麻木到一种程度……走到某处他提到了一个睡在地上的人，这个人与他面容相同，胸口插着那把杀死他们的angel blade。Castiel半睁着眼睛看他，随后又无言地往上看去——Jimmy在他身边坐下抬头观望，灵魂的光点在无边无际的黑暗上方坠落，天堂和地狱早就在战争中摧毁，无处可去的灵魂尽数归于虚无。等Jimmy回过神时虚无的触手已经覆盖了他半身，而在他被黏腻阴沉的黑暗覆盖之前他往旁边看去，Castiel已经彻底沉没，不知所踪了。

### Idea translated

Apocalypse world, the difficult and pain and struggle between Castiel and Jimmy

It's a world without Winchesters, so Castiel doesn't come to Earth and Hell to save the righteous man, he's here for the Apocalypse war. Jimmy is still a devout man, praying for a peaceful world, for the safety and health of his family. But with Castiel changed, they have a difficult time.

Jimmy tries to escape, to rebel, for many times. Castiel warns him in the first, and then, he just leaves. Jimmy thinks he is free, but his body is already ruined by the angel grace. He is found by the other angels on his way of escape. The angels say, "Look, isn't that the vessel Castiel said didn't comply? Should we help him fix it?" They starts to torture Jimmy.

It's too painful for any human to bear. Jimmy can't help thinking, would Castiel come back? Does he have to be punished like this? He had given him everything, his body, his mind, does he have to give up his last consciousness and his soul, too? Castiel, why are you doing this to me? Are you not an angel?

It's supposed to be just *normal* torture, but when the angels start talking about breaking his brain so that the only thing he can think about is saying "yes", Castiel come back. He come back in Claire. He looks at Jimmy, and casts all those who tortured him out. Because he's still his vessel, they don't get to make decisions for him.

He brings Jimmy to a lone deserted room, tells him to rest. Jimmy can't rest. He is watching Claire. Castiel tells him, "It's your daughter, I know. I found her at the edge of the war zone, wounded, dying." He continues, "I healed her. She will live even if I leave her now." But it doesn't matter, anyone incompetent to live will die. He didn't say it.

Claire's coat is torn, looking like it's been through some massive explosions. But the lining is mostly intact, decent. But Jimmy cannot feel comforted.

The dim room is quiet for a long time, Jimmy's mind starts drifting. He starts to wonder if the place they're in, this room, might be a decent hotel room before the Apocalypse. How many angels are there outside. Or maybe this is Castiel's secret base, there is no other angels. -- But could he be this kind? He had already known Castiel is not the caring angel he imagined him to be, he's just another coldblooded soldier, like the rest of them, maybe even more so -- he seems to be in a high rank, judging by the way other angels retreat and salute upon his arrival.

He gives up trying to escape, he thinks he'll never do it again. His nerve never stops aching in the days Castiel left him. He knows he can't get away, can't run to anywhere.

Maybe the pain will stop once Castiel come back inside him. He doesn't want Castiel wear his young daughter to the battlefield, but how could he ask, when he knows agony and nightmare will be all that's waiting for him?

A sleepless night.

When Castiel comes back to him the next day, Jimmy tells him, "Use me. Use me instead of my daughter. Take my daughter to somewhere safe. I won't question you again, I won't fight against you. I'm yours now, utterly and completely."

Castiel brings Claire to the wild woods far from the hot zone -- but it's just a zone they haven't spread to yet. It's just a matter of time. He doesn't want to use a young girl's body anyway.

When he comes inside Jimmy, the human thinks vaguely, his nerve does stop aching. Because he can't feel anything at all.

It's like a deep sleep. Sometimes Jimmy will startle to awake by the faint pain in his brain and his nerves. He sees himself in impossible situations, in the middle of war. Sometimes his body is torn apart, sometimes even half his skull is blown away by explosions. He'll die a hundred times as a human, but it seems only to be half a second to de-sync angel's grace with his consciousness.

The thought of defiance does come across his mind, once. To struggle free when Castiel is too busy fighting the war. But then he thinks, if not him, then who's going to be Castiel's next vessel. Who's going to suffer the unsufferable.

But some other times, it feels different. Castiel is not wounded, he's just lying on something, like an operational table. It's not pain that Jimmy is feeling, it's a numbness. He wants to stand up, but he can't. He touches his head, and finds an iron circle around his skull, long and short nails pinning inside his head. His hands tremble uncontrollably.

He thinks he must pass out by the horrible scene. The blackness is like falling. He thinks he sees Castiel's falling consciousness on his way down. It's the darkness inside his mind, inside both their minds. Angel's mind is pinned by those iron nails, he's like a bird getting shot by the hunters. Falling straight down from the sky, with blood spreading from the wound, the feathers scattering.

The last time Jimmy wakes up, is when Castiel is dying. Jimmy doesn't know where they are, but his mind comes clearer as Castiel's getting fainter. He feels pain, but not only in his mind, not only in his nerves. He feels the burning from angel's grace, the incineration of angel's grace combusting his body, his organs, his eyes and his brain. But before he dies, he sees the angel in a tan trench coat -- the one wearing the same face as his, it's "Castiel" killing him, killing them. But maybe, he has already died long before that.

The last consciousness of his drifts in the Empty. Jimmy wanders in the endless blackness, not feeling any pain, not any feelings, really. The numbness covers him, carries him.

He kicks a man sleeping in his drifting. The man has his face, with the angel blade that killed them on his chest. Castiel looks up at him with eyes half-open, wordless. And he looks up, at the place where lights of souls are dropping like rainfalls.

Jimmy sits down beside him, looking up at the falling souls from the bottomless darkness -- Heaven and Hell has long been destroyed in the war, homeless souls all come to the Empty. Everyone is falling to the Empty.

By the time Jimmy looks back down, the tentacles of the Empty already covers half his body. And when he looks beside him, there is nothing and no one left. Swallowed by the Empty, Castiel is long gone.

## Outline

(Apocalypse world, the pain and struggle between Castiel and Jimmy)

Jimmy is a devout man, praying for angels to protect his family, praying for a peaceful world. Then Apocalypse starts, and Castiel comes to him, he says yes. Castiel goes to Hell for a mission, but not to save the righteous man, it's to open the Cage himself, to let Lucifer out (he's the one started Apocalypse on Michael's order).

Castiel leads the army to war, fight demons and sometimes humans if they're on his way, torture them for information, it's everything against what Jimmy wants. Their consciousness doesn't align, it causes Jimmy's nerve great pain. He begs Castiel to protect his wife and daughter, but Castiel doesn't care about humans, only focusing on the war.

Jimmy tries to take back the consent, to cast Castiel out, he fights him in his brain, trying to escape, to rebel, for many times, to relieve the pain. Castiel warns him not to, taking back control every time. And when he fights again, he finally leaves.

Jimmy thinks he's free, but his body is already ruined by angel grace. He can barely walk or run, he has pain all over his body. He's found by other angels on his way of escaping from angel camp.

Other angels say, "Look, isn't that the vessel Castiel said didn't comply? Should we help him fix it?" They start to torture Jimmy.

It's too painful for any human to bear. Jimmy can't help thinking if Castiel would come back to him. What did he do wrong? Does he have to be punished like this? He had given him everything, his body, his mind, his health, does he have to give up his last consciousness and his soul, too? *Castiel, why are you doing this to me? Are you not an angel?*

It's supposed to be just *normal* torture, but when the angels start talking about breaking his brain so that the only thing he can think about is saying "yes", Castiel come back. He come back in Claire. He looks at Jimmy, and casts all those who tortured him out. Because he's still *his* vessel, they don't get to make decisions for him.

He brings Jimmy to a lone deserted room, tells him to rest. Jimmy can't rest. He is watching Claire. Castiel tells him, "It's your daughter, I know. I found her at the edge of the war zone, wounded, dying." He continues, "I healed her. She will live even if I leave her now." But it doesn't matter, anyone incompetent to live will die. He didn't say it.

Claire's coat is torn, looking like it's been through some massive explotions. But the lining is mostly intact, decent. But Jimmy cannot feel comforted.

The dim room is quiet for a long time, Jimmy's mind starts drifting. He starts to wonder if the place they're in, this room, might be a decent hotel room before the Apocalypse. How many angels are there outside. Or maybe this is Castiel's secret base, there is no other angels. -- But could he be this kind? He had already known Castiel is not the caring angel he imagined him to be, he's just another coldblooded soldier, like the rest of them, maybe even more so -- he seems to be in a high rank, judging by the way other angels retreat and salute upon his arrival.

He gives up trying to escape for a long time, he doesn't think he'll ever try it again. His nerve never stops aching in the days Castiel left him. He knows he can't get away, can't run to anywhere. It's his fate, his destiny, the way he'll die.

Besides, if not him, who is going to be Castiel's next vessel, to endure all those pain he's been suffering? To suffer the unsufferable? Certainly can't be his daughter.

He thinks, maybe the pain will stop once Castiel comes back inside him. He doesn't want Castiel wear his young daughter to the battlefield, but how could he ask, when he knows agony and nightmare will be all that's waiting for him?

A sleepless night.

When Castiel comes back to him the next day, Jimmy tells him, "Use me. Use me instead of my daughter. Take my daughter to somewhere safe. I won't question you again, I won't fight against you. I'm yours now, utterly and completely."

Castiel doesn't want to use a young girl's body anyway. He brings Claire to the wild woods far from the hot zone --but it's just a zone they haven't spread to yet. It's just a matter of time.

When he comes inside Jimmy, Jimmy thinks vaguely, his nerbe does stop aching. Because he can't feel anything at all anymore.

It's like a deep sleep. He startles awake sometimes, by the faint pain in his brain and his nerves. He sees himself in impossible situations, in the middle of war. His body is torn apart, half his head is blown away by explosions. He'll die a hundred times as a human, but it seems only to be half a second de-sync angel's grace with his consciousness.

The next time feels different. Castiel is not wounded, he's just lying on something, like an operational table. It's not pain that Jimmy is feeling, it's a numbness. He wants to stand up, but his body doesn't comply. He touches his head and finds an iron circle around his skull, long and short nails pinning inside his head. His hands tremble uncontrollably.

He passes out from the horrible scene. The blackness followed is like falling. He thinks he sees Castiel's sinking consciousness on his way down. It's the darkness inside his mind, inside both their minds. Angel's mind is pinned by those iron nails, he's like a bird getting shot by the hunters. Falling straight down from the sky, with blood spreading from the wound, the feathers scattering. He barely has much feathers left, they are worn, detorted, hardened, more like blades than plumage.

The last time Jimmy wakes up, is when Castiel is dying. Jimmy doesn't know where they are, but his mind comes clearer as Castiel's getting fainter. He feels pain, but not only in his mind, not only in his nerves. He feels the burning from angel's grace, the incineration of angel's grace combusting his body, his organs, his eyes and his brain. But before he dies, he sees the angel in a tan trench coat -- the one wearing the same face as his, it's "Castiel" killing him, killing them. But maybe, he has already died long before that.
