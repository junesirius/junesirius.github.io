(Jimmy POV)

## Idea

### Raw inspiration

(quoted, not original)

这是一个没有温家兄弟的世界，所以Cas来地球的目的不是为了救righteous man而是为了apocalypse战争做准备。这个世界的Jimmy设定没有变，但因为Cas目的变了，所以他们的磨合其实并不好。

Jimmy尝试反抗过很多次。Cas一开始会亲自警告他，后来有一次选择直接离开了Jimmy。Jimmy以为自己自由了，但他的身体已经被天使grace折磨得不太好了。他在逃跑途中被其他天使发现抓了回去，天使说这就是Castiel说的不听话的vessel啊，要不要我们帮Castiel解决这个麻烦呢。就开始折磨Jimmy

因为太痛苦了，Jimmy忍不住在想，Castiel会回来吗，对我需要惩罚到如此地步吗？我什么都给他了，难道连我的良知和思想，都要彻底交托么？Castiel你不会这样的吧？

本来也只是普通的折磨而已，在天使提出要不直接弄坏他的大脑，让他有说yes的意识但没有深度思考的能力的时候，Castiel还是回来了，而且还是穿着Claire回来的。他看了Jimmy一眼，把折磨Jimmy的天使都揍了一遍。但根本上还是觉得，其他天使无权为他决定Jimmy的任何事。

之后他把Jimmy带到了一个单独的废弃房间，让Jimmy休息。但Jimmy不愿意休息，只是反复观察Claire。Castiel说“这是你的女儿，我知道。我遇到她时她在战区边缘，受伤很严重。”过了一会儿补充，“我把她治好了。就算我离开，她也会继续活着。”只是没有任何意义，因为缺乏生存能力的人都会死——只不过他没说出口。

Claire的外套是烂的，看起来被战火轰炸过。但内衬姑且被恢复了一些，保留了一些体面，但Jimmy无法为此感到欣慰。

昏暗的房间内沉默了很久，Jimmy的思绪开始飘散。他开始思考这里在被战火波及之前是否曾是不错的旅店，现在这房间外又有多少天使，又或者这是Castiel的秘密基地外面并没有其他人——怎么可能呢，他早就知道Castiel不是他以为的那个独特的天使了，他是个冷血的士兵。他也不会想逃跑了，Castiel离开他的这么些天内他的神经从来没有停止过疼痛，他知道他跑不掉，也跑不远。

也许Castiel重新附身他就不会再疼了，他也不愿意让Castiel穿着他年幼的女儿上战场，可是他应当如何开口，如何邀请苦难和噩梦重新拥抱他？

无眠了一晚上，第二天Jimmy还是在Castiel来看他时说了，“用我，别用我的女儿。把我女儿放在安全的地方吧，我不会再质疑，更不会再反抗，我完全是你的了。”

Castiel把Claire带到了战区外的荒林里，重新转移到Jimmy身上。他确实也不想用一个年幼女孩的身体。而在他重新进入Jimmy的时候，Jimmy在想，他进来后我的神经确实不疼了。

之后就像是深度睡眠，偶尔Jimmy会被神经上隐约的疼痛惊醒，意识朦胧地看见自己身处各种险境，比如身体被撕碎，半边脑袋被炮火炸散。放在人类身上一定是会死的伤势，似乎也只够让天使的grace与他的意识短暂失调不到半秒。

偶尔他也想过反抗，想过趁乱挣扎，但又会有一瞬间犹豫：“如果不是我，那么Castiel下一个vessel会是谁”

但有时候又不一样，Castiel没有受伤，他只是……躺在一个像手术台一样的地方。Jimmy觉得不疼，他想站起来，但做不到。他摸摸脑袋，发现铁圈罩着他的额头，脑袋上都是深深浅浅的钉子。他的手在控制不住地颤抖。

随后他就被这个骇人的事实吓晕过去。晕过去的感觉像在坠落，他似乎在坠回谷底之前看见了Castiel，天使的意识被那些入脑的长钉固定，多余的羽毛被剪去，翅膀内测所剩无几的柔软绒羽寸寸枯萎，余下的每一根羽毛都像冷硬的金属片。

最后一次醒来是Castiel死的时候，Jimmy没弄清楚情况，只是随着Castiel的垂死意识越发清楚了。他感觉疼痛，不再是神经的疼痛而是无处不在，天使垂死不受控制的grace焚化了他的内脏，烧焦了他的眼球……但在死前他看到了穿着风衣的天使，他没有搞清楚情况，他只模糊地感觉到，“Castiel”在杀他。不过在某种意义上，他或许早就死了

最后一点意识是在虚无里，Jimmy在漫无边际的黑暗中行走，感觉不到疼痛也感觉不到任何情绪，或者说是被各种负面情绪压垮已经麻木到一种程度……走到某处他提到了一个睡在地上的人，这个人与他面容相同，胸口插着那把杀死他们的angel blade。Castiel半睁着眼睛看他，随后又无言地往上看去——Jimmy在他身边坐下抬头观望，灵魂的光点在无边无际的黑暗上方坠落，天堂和地狱早就在战争中摧毁，无处可去的灵魂尽数归于虚无。等Jimmy回过神时虚无的触手已经覆盖了他半身，而在他被黏腻阴沉的黑暗覆盖之前他往旁边看去，Castiel已经彻底沉没，不知所踪了。

### Idea translated

Apocalypse world, the difficult and pain and struggle between Castiel and Jimmy

It's a world without Winchesters, so Castiel doesn't come to Earth and Hell to save the righteous man, he's here for the Apocalypse war. Jimmy is still a devout man, praying for a peaceful world, for the safety and health of his family. But with Castiel changed, they have a difficult time.

Jimmy tries to escape, to rebel, for many times. Castiel warns him in the first, and then, he just leaves. Jimmy thinks he is free, but his body is already ruined by the angel grace. He is found by the other angels on his way of escape. The angels say, "Look, isn't that the vessel Castiel said didn't comply? Should we help him fix it?" They starts to torture Jimmy.

It's too painful for any human to bear. Jimmy can't help thinking, would Castiel come back? Does he have to be punished like this? He had given him everything, his body, his mind, does he have to give up his last consciousness and his soul, too? Castiel, why are you doing this to me? Are you not an angel?

It's supposed to be just *normal* torture, but when the angels start talking about breaking his brain so that the only thing he can think about is saying "yes", Castiel come back. He come back in Claire. He looks at Jimmy, and casts all those who tortured him out. Because he's still his vessel, they don't get to make decisions for him.

He brings Jimmy to a lone deserted room, tells him to rest. Jimmy can't rest. He is watching Claire. Castiel tells him, "It's your daughter, I know. I found her at the edge of the war zone, wounded, dying." He continues, "I healed her. She will live even if I leave her now." But it doesn't matter, anyone incompetent to live will die. He didn't say it.

Claire's coat is torn, looking like it's been through some massive explosions. But the lining is mostly intact, decent. But Jimmy cannot feel comforted.

The dim room is quiet for a long time, Jimmy's mind starts drifting. He starts to wonder if the place they're in, this room, might be a decent hotel room before the Apocalypse. How many angels are there outside. Or maybe this is Castiel's secret base, there is no other angels. -- But could he be this kind? He had already known Castiel is not the caring angel he imagined him to be, he's just another coldblooded soldier, like the rest of them, maybe even more so -- he seems to be in a high rank, judging by the way other angels retreat and salute upon his arrival.

He gives up trying to escape, he thinks he'll never do it again. His nerve never stops aching in the days Castiel left him. He knows he can't get away, can't run to anywhere.

Maybe the pain will stop once Castiel come back inside him. He doesn't want Castiel wear his young daughter to the battlefield, but how could he ask, when he knows agony and nightmare will be all that's waiting for him?

A sleepless night.

When Castiel comes back to him the next day, Jimmy tells him, "Use me. Use me instead of my daughter. Take my daughter to somewhere safe. I won't question you again, I won't fight against you. I'm yours now, utterly and completely."

Castiel brings Claire to the wild woods far from the hot zone -- but it's just a zone they haven't spread to yet. It's just a matter of time. He doesn't want to use a young girl's body anyway.

When he comes inside Jimmy, the human thinks vaguely, his nerve does stop aching. Because he can't feel anything at all.

It's like a deep sleep. Sometimes Jimmy will startle to awake by the faint pain in his brain and his nerves. He sees himself in impossible situations, in the middle of war. Sometimes his body is torn apart, sometimes even half his skull is blown away by explosions. He'll die a hundred times as a human, but it seems only to be half a second to de-sync angel's grace with his consciousness.

The thought of defiance does come across his mind, once. To struggle free when Castiel is too busy fighting the war. But then he thinks, if not him, then who's going to be Castiel's next vessel. Who's going to suffer the unsufferable.

But some other times, it feels different. Castiel is not wounded, he's just lying on something, like an operational table. It's not pain that Jimmy is feeling, it's a numbness. He wants to stand up, but he can't. He touches his head, and finds an iron circle around his skull, long and short nails pinning inside his head. His hands tremble uncontrollably.

He thinks he must pass out by the horrible scene. The blackness is like falling. He thinks he sees Castiel's falling consciousness on his way down. It's the darkness inside his mind, inside both their minds. Angel's mind is pinned by those iron nails, he's like a bird getting shot by the hunters. Falling straight down from the sky, with blood spreading from the wound, the feathers scattering.

The last time Jimmy wakes up, is when Castiel is dying. Jimmy doesn't know where they are, but his mind comes clearer as Castiel's getting fainter. He feels pain, but not only in his mind, not only in his nerves. He feels the burning from angel's grace, the incineration of angel's grace combusting his body, his organs, his eyes and his brain. But before he dies, he sees the angel in a tan trench coat -- the one wearing the same face as his, it's "Castiel" killing him, killing them. But maybe, he has already died long before that.

The last consciousness of his drifts in the Empty. Jimmy wanders in the endless blackness, not feeling any pain, not any feelings, really. The numbness covers him, carries him.

He kicks a man sleeping in his drifting. The man has his face, with the angel blade that killed them on his chest. Castiel looks up at him with eyes half-open, wordless. And he looks up, at the place where lights of souls are dropping like rainfalls.

Jimmy sits down beside him, looking up at the falling souls from the bottomless darkness -- Heaven and Hell has long been destroyed in the war, homeless souls all come to the Empty. Everyone is falling to the Empty.

By the time Jimmy looks back down, the tentacles of the Empty already covers half his body. And when he looks beside him, there is nothing and no one left. Swallowed by the Empty, Castiel is long gone.

## Outline

(Apocalypse world, the pain and struggle between Castiel and Jimmy)

Jimmy is a devout man, praying for angels to protect his family, praying for a peaceful world. Then Apocalypse starts, and Castiel comes to him, he says yes. Castiel goes to Hell for a mission, but not to save the righteous man, it's to kill Lilith and open the Cage himself, to let Lucifer out (he's the one started Apocalypse on Michael's order; the righteous man who broke the first seal is John Winchester, Mary never made deal to save him, he's in Hell all the time).

Castiel leads the army to war, fight demons and sometimes humans if they're on his way, torture them for information, it's everything against what Jimmy wants. Their consciousness doesn't align, it causes Jimmy's nerve great pain. He begs Castiel to protect his wife and daughter, but Castiel doesn't care about humans, only focusing on the war.

Jimmy tries to take back the consent, to cast Castiel out, he fights him in his brain, trying to escape, to rebel, for many times, to relieve the pain. Castiel warns him not to, taking back control every time. And when he fights again, he finally leaves.

Jimmy thinks he's free, but his body is already ruined by angel grace. He can barely walk or run, he has pain all over his body. He's found by other angels on his way of escaping from angel camp.

Other angels say, "Look, isn't that the vessel Castiel said didn't comply? Should we help him fix it?" They start to torture Jimmy.

It's too painful for any human to bear. Jimmy can't help thinking if Castiel would come back to him. What did he do wrong? Does he have to be punished like this? He had given him everything, his body, his mind, his health, does he have to give up his last consciousness and his soul, too? *Castiel, why are you doing this to me? Are you not an angel?*

It's supposed to be just *normal* torture, but when the angels start talking about breaking his brain so that the only thing he can think about is saying "yes", Castiel come back. He come back in Claire. He looks at Jimmy, and casts all those who tortured him out. Because he's still *his* vessel, they don't get to make decisions for him.

He brings Jimmy to a lone deserted room, tells him to rest. Jimmy can't rest. He is watching Claire. Castiel tells him, "It's your daughter, I know. I found her at the edge of the war zone, wounded, dying." He continues, "I healed her. She will live even if I leave her now." But it doesn't matter, anyone incompetent to live will die. He didn't say it.

Claire's coat is torn, looking like it's been through some massive explotions. But the lining is mostly intact, decent. But Jimmy cannot feel comforted.

The dim room is quiet for a long time, Jimmy's mind starts drifting. He starts to wonder if the place they're in, this room, might be a decent hotel room before the Apocalypse. How many angels are there outside. Or maybe this is Castiel's secret base, there is no other angels. -- But could he be this kind? He had already known Castiel is not the caring angel he imagined him to be, he's just another coldblooded soldier, like the rest of them, maybe even more so -- he seems to be in a high rank, judging by the way other angels retreat and salute upon his arrival.

He gives up trying to escape for a long time, he doesn't think he'll ever try it again. His nerve never stops aching in the days Castiel left him. He knows he can't get away, can't run to anywhere. It's his fate, his destiny, the way he'll die.

Besides, if not him, who is going to be Castiel's next vessel, to endure all those pain he's been suffering? To suffer the unsufferable? Certainly can't be his daughter.

He thinks, maybe the pain will stop once Castiel comes back inside him. He doesn't want Castiel wear his young daughter to the battlefield, but how could he ask, when he knows agony and nightmare will be all that's waiting for him?

A sleepless night.

When Castiel comes back to him the next day, Jimmy tells him, "Use me. Use me instead of my daughter. Take my daughter to somewhere safe. I won't question you again, I won't fight against you. I'm yours now, utterly and completely."

Castiel doesn't want to use a young girl's body anyway. He brings Claire to the wild woods far from the hot zone --but it's just a zone they haven't spread to yet. It's just a matter of time.

When he comes inside Jimmy, Jimmy thinks vaguely, his nerbe does stop aching. Because he can't feel anything at all anymore.

It's like a deep sleep. He startles awake sometimes, by the faint pain in his brain and his nerves. He sees himself in impossible situations, in the middle of war. His body is torn apart, half his head is blown away by explosions. He'll die a hundred times as a human, but it seems only to be half a second de-sync angel's grace with his consciousness.

The next time feels different. Castiel is not wounded, he's just lying on something, like an operational table. It's not pain that Jimmy is feeling, it's a numbness. He wants to stand up, but his body doesn't comply. He touches his head and finds an iron circle around his skull, long and short nails pinning inside his head. His hands tremble uncontrollably.

He passes out from the horrible scene. The blackness followed is like falling. He thinks he sees Castiel's sinking consciousness on his way down. It's the darkness inside his mind, inside both their minds. Angel's mind is pinned by those iron nails, he's like a bird getting shot by the hunters. Falling straight down from the sky, with blood spreading from the wound, the feathers scattering. He barely has much feathers left, they are worn, detorted, hardened, more like blades than plumage.

The last time Jimmy wakes up, is when Castiel is dying. Jimmy doesn't know where they are, but his mind comes clearer as Castiel's getting fainter. He feels pain, but not only in his mind, not only in his nerves. He feels the burning from angel's grace, the incineration of angel's grace combusting his body, his organs, his eyes and his brain. But before he dies, he sees the angel in a tan trench coat -- the one wearing the same face as his, it's "Castiel" killing him, killing them. But maybe, he has already died long before that.

The last consciousness of his drifts in the Empty. Jimmy wanders in the endless blackness, not feeling any pain, not any feelings, really. The numbness covers him, carries him.

> Jimmy is a devout man, praying for angels to protect his family, praying for a peaceful world. Then Apocalypse starts, and Castiel comes to him, he says yes. Castiel goes to Hell for a mission, but not to save the righteous man, it's to kill Lilith and open the Cage himself, to let Lucifer out (he's the one started Apocalypse on Michael's order; the righteous man who broke the first seal is John Winchester, Mary never made deal to save him, he's in Hell all the time).

*And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribe of Israel. There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west. The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.*

*The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls. The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long. The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits thick. The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass.*

*I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.*

<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">
<br>
Jimmy wakes up slowly, blinking in the thin light of the early morning, pale grey through the curtain of the room. The blazing image of the new Jerusalem is still shining in the lingering memory behind his eyelids. He tries hard to remember the details of the holy city, the light and shiny reflections of its walls and ground, the place that doesn't need sun or moon to shine on it, the place with all light and no night -- but the dream slips through his mind like water through open fingers.

He turns on the bed, and finds his hand rested on the Bible on his bed stand. It must be where the dream comes from, then. He thinks distantly. With all these years of praying and believing, for once, he is granted a vision. However brief, it must be a sign, a reward, to allow him to have a glimpse of the great glory after the ending.

Amelia stirs next to him. "What time is it now?" she asks dreamily.

"Still early," Jimmy answers. His wife sinks back to sleep before he can say anything else -- he can tell from the rhythm of her breath.

The vision of the dream fades over the grey image of the ceiling. He finds it difficult to remember the color of the light or the wall of the glorious city now. He leaves the bed quietly and changes into his usual suit before heading outside.

The sky is grey with thick cloud covering from one end of the horizon to the other, darker over the edge. The ground is as pale as the canopy. And he knows it wouldn't change much even after a few hours when the sun should be rising. He hasn't seen the sun for many days now, and the sky never clear since the day the news said St. Mary's Convent in Ilchester, Maryland exploded in a strong beam of light. No one knows what is happening to the world, but the popular rumor is that the end is nigh, and the apocalypse is coming.

But it could also be just some change of the climate.

Jimmy takes a deep breath, putting his hands together before his chest, facing the sky with eyes closed. *Bless the world, oh, Lord, and thy angels,* he prays, concentrating on the scrap of memory of the dream, *and ourselves to thy loving service that we may always continue in thy faith and fear to the honor and glory of thy name.*

The news from yesterday also said Detroit has seen a panic wave from city people. Many stores were broken in by people believing the apocalypse theory; there were some number of injuries, fire accidents, and an outbreak of city-wise outage. The city governor has announced an emergency curfew. Jimmy turned off the TV last night before the reporter could finish. The panic wave hasn't reached Pontiac, Illinois, but he doesn't know if or when it might happen to them. The neighborhood is blessingly quiet around him right now.

He demands his wandering thought come back to the moment, to the sky and angel, to the bright light in the dream. He adds to the prayer, *May the world a peaceful place to live, and may my family safe. Amen.*

When he opens his eyes, the sky over his head opens, and a heavenly bright light dawning down over his head. Jimmy starts, looking up at the light, but it's so bright that his eyes are are hurting with a rising heat at the back of the socket. He has to shut his eyes tight, panicking over what is happening.

The high-pitched voice sounds up right then, answering him, "Do you give yourself to the angels?" The voice is as if it comes from the sky, and comes from the deepest of his brain in the same time. His eardrums vibrate with the pitch, ringing with echoes even when the voice is not speaking, threatening to break but miraculously not.

Jimmy knows it must be the angels. The angels are real. He knows it. He knows it all along.

"What does that mean?" he has to ask. He thinks about the lamb and the sacrifice from the Book. But surely he is plain enough not to be asked to be that, isn't he?

"The apocalypse is coming," the angel answers. "The army of Michael will fight the army of Lucifer, the Devil."

"Revelation 12:7," Jimmy murmurs, knowing every line to the heart.

"More like 20:7," the angel says plainly. "The thousand years is over and Lucifer will be released from his prison. What happened thousand years ago will happen again. War will break out again, and this time, when the Heaven wins, the Devil will be thrown into the lake of burning sulfur to be tormented forever."

Jimmy takes slow breath, digesting. It is one thing to believe the angels are real, that Heaven and Hell exist, but completely another to realize it's *literal*, that the war and therefore probably the wrath of the Lord might *actually* land on Earth. Let alone he's talking to one at the moment. He rubs his eyes and glances up again. The light from the sky is still over his head, enveloping him and him alone in the pale yard in front of his house.

"Which angel are you?" Jimmy asks tentatively, then hurriedly add timidly, "if I may."

"Castiel, Angel of the Lord," the angel says. The voice is growing lower and more rapid, as if he is getting impatient. Jimmy flinches at the solemnness in the pitch. "Will you give yourself up to me, Jimmy Novak? I need a vessel to fight the war. You will play a part in this war."

Jimmy thinks for a beat, but he dares not to let the angel in the light wait for too long. But there is just one more question, "Why me?"

"It is in your blood," Castiel says briefly.

*What do that mean?* Jimmy thinks, but doesn't ask this time. The angel will let him know what he needs to know, and this is for the best for the world, right? At the end of the day, they're talking about Revelation, about Heaven's victory, about the New Heaven and a New Earth, if all is to be believed from the Book.

He closes his eyes briefly, and finds the image of the Holy City comes back to him. It is what will happen if he does this, he realizes -- the city shining with the glory of God, brilliant like a jasper, clear as crystal and glass; the city so bright and full of light that no sun or moon is needed and it has no night. When Heaven wins the war against the Devil, it will be paradise on Earth -- everyone will be peaceful and happy. He believes it -- no, he knows it. He doesn't question where the vision comes from.

"I do this, my family, will they be safe and granted to the new world once it all finishes?" Jimmy gathers his courage to ask one last question.

"Yes," Castiel says without pause.

"Then, yes." Jimmy faces the direction of the light, closing his eyes.

Even with eyes closed, he can feel the stream of power envelop him. The air sizzles with electricity. His hair stands on end when a gush of wind twirl around him, blowing the skirt of his trench coat flying. The electricity passes from the air to his skin, then crawls into his veins, flowing across his body, sinking deeper into his bones.

He suddenly feels too hot and too cold at the same time under his skin, and then, he doesn't feel anything. He is sitting in the living room sofa in his house, looking at a TV screen. The screen shows the neighborhood block under the grey sky. The image starts moving, and he realizes it must be the angel -- Castiel -- starts walking away, in his body, with his feet. It's an odd feeling, as if sitting in the passenger's seat of a car that's yours since birth.

"Castiel?" he tries tentatively, unsure if the angel can still hear him. His own voice vibrates in the little space of the imagined living room from his memory. It looks real enough, since he knows all the insides and outsides of that house they lived for ten years, but it's just his memory -- it's not real in that he knows if he tries one of the closed doors, he won't find a connected bedroom with his wife sleeping on their bed, or his daughter doing homework in her room. -- Oh God, he forgets to even leave them a note or message before he lets Castiel walk away with his body; they'd be worried sick and think he just goes missing.

"Castiel?" Jimmy tries again, in a louder voice and talking to the TV screen this time -- not knowing why, but it feels like the only thing connected to the outside, probably to the same street view that Castiel is seeing. "Sorry but, is there any chance you could let me leave a message to Amelia? Just let them know where I'm going, that I'll be okay."

"No." Castiel's stiff voice passes through the radio that he used to have over the mantel. The voice sounds a little like his own, but twisted, so much lower and colder that he doesn't register at first. It might be because the radio just tend to twist people's voice? Jimmy quickly explains to himself. But the quick and absolute rejection is still taking him aback.

"No?" Jimmy blinks. "Why not? It wouldn't take more than a minute."

The vision in the TV screen is still moving fast away from his house, faster than a normal human's walking pace. Jimmy wonders briefly how his body is capable of moving in that speed.

"Because," Castiel gives a meaningful pause, then, in a scolding tone, "if I do this, what's next? Buy your daughter a fruit cake? Pet your neighbor's dog?"

Jimmy blinks, sinking back into his easy chair in front of the TV at dismay. The angel is different from what he thought.

Castiel continues harshly, "In case you forget, we're at the verge of Apocalypse, and there is a war to fight. I don't have time for any petty human things. And another warning ahead, you shouldn't talk about things you don't understand -- I'm sure there will be many things you won't understand and I don't expect you to -- you're just a human, after all. You should just go to sleep or whatever you do in your head."

The radio falls quiet as the angel finishes.

Jimmy rubs his eyes again. It starts to feel like a bad decision.

<br>

He feels bone tired. But he doesn't even have a body to feel tired.

Jimmy slumps in the easy chair, watching the TV screen shifting in and out idly, not knowing what else to do. The signal gets worse when the angel moves too fast -- at least that's his assumption right now. Or perhaps Castiel is blocking him out, not letting him see the outside world. He wouldn't know, but Jimmy prefers to believe it's the former.

The screen was showing the static snow flake image for the last few hours, or maybe it's just minutes. He loses the sense of time as well. The clock on the wall doesn't move ever since he comes into the space.

He has paced around the space for ten rounds, if not more, and every time he passes the main door of the house, he wonders if he should try the door or find a way to take a look at the outside, and what will happen if he does. And every time there is a tiny voice in his head nudging him don't do that, that's a bad idea. And he listens to it, circling back to the center of the living room.

He tries to close his eyes, too. Going to sleep, like Castiel instructed. Maybe he did fall into sleep, maybe he just rested his eyes (that's not really there) for however long time it passed. He doesn't know either way. It's frustrating.

There is no dream, either. He misses it.

For the majority of the time when he's awake, Jimmy spends them thinking about things from the past, memories of Amelia and Claire, or reciting line by line the Holy Bible. He finds it soothing to go over the lines that tell the glory and victory at the aftermath of the disasters and catastrophes. Maybe this isn't a bad decision after all.

And then, the TV screen changes. The image shifts from static snow flakes to pure black.

Jimmy sits on the floor right in front of the TV screen like a child asking for more screen hour, tilts his head and squeezes his eyes, trying to understand what is it that he's looking at. The darkness almost looks like Castiel has his eyes closed in his sleep, except that he knows angels don't sleep.

Something flies by before the view -- flies upward, to be exact. The blackness is disturbed by the movements without shapes, like ripples on a water surface but the pebbles disturbing it are already sunken and can't be seen. The shadows of shapes move past him, all flying upward. Then something burning like a fire ball, also flashes upward, leaving a tail of light trace. That's when Jimmy realizes it is them, descending.

"Where are we going?" Jimmy asks.

No answer.

From the speed of their dropping, they must be going down to somewhere really, extremely deep. And what is so deep down from the earth, if they are not talking geographically? The question answers itself --

Hell.

Castiel is taking them to Hell.

Because, of course Hell is real. Just as literal as Heaven and angels.

Jimmy shivers.

As soon as the thought comes to him, the smell of sulfur permeates the room. The fireplace in the room starts burning with red-black fire, the dark flame bobbling ominously, as if Hell is also literally infiltrating into his head, instead of just encompassing his body from the outside.

The descent slows down more the deeper they get to. Jimmy can tell from the speed of other shadows surrounding them. And shortly, they are not just *surrounding*. The black shadows lurch toward him.

"Castiel!" Jimmy yells out reflexively.

In the blink of an eye, a flash of a blade cuts the closest shadow in half. The shadow looks more like a vaguely twisted human-shaped smoke now, in this short distance. And from the place where the blade sliced it, golden light leaps to burn the rest of it to ashes. Only then does Jimmy see the blade Castiel's hand -- his own hand -- is holding.

"What's that?!" Jimmy gasps.

"Demons," Castiel answers stoically, voice coming through the radio like before. And then, "Shush, you're very loud today. I need all my power for this mission, so I can't mind your business. Be quiet. Distract me again and you will regret it."

Jimmy stares at the TV screen with wide eyes.

*He's just trying to help.* He wants to say. But on the second thought, just in case it also gets counted as "distracting", he might as well not say anything at all.

He doesn't sign up for going to Hell or facing demons when he said "yes" to Castiel. Not even the Book mentions anything about demon, only the Devil and the angels that follow him. Jimmy thinks distantly. But, of course, the angel has no obligation to inform him any of that and is totally capable of handling the demons on his own.

Jimmy tries to relax the muscle on his imaginary shoulder, but his imaginary body is still tense.

Castiel continues fighting his way downward. More and more demons besiege them, and each and every one of them get sliced and killed. Some of them might finally get a grasp on his body, digging long cuts into his muscle. Jimmy feels a numb pain at the far tip of his consciousness, like a throbbing bruise dulled down from a numb limb. He wonders how far they are going to go and if Hell really is a bottomless pit.

But he bites his tongue, literally, just to not say anything, not to distract the angel, even though he really just want to help.

The wave of demonic attacks thickens. On the dark background of Hell's downward passageway, Jimmy can't see exactly how many demons are encircling them, but Castiel's move is slowing down. He wonders if the angel sees the demon differently from his celestial eyes.

And then, there is an explosion of light. The light starts from the center of the view, like the cold blue flame at the peripheral of burning gas fire. It fills the whole vision in a blink, bursting inside and outside in the same time. Jimmy feels a gush of power rushing through the room he's in and his whole consciousness, shoving him fly into the wall at the far end and drop violently to the floor. A photo frame on the mantel falls to the floor and shatters. It's that confusing sensation of cold and hot pulse flowing through his veins again. The tip of his nerve quivers in the burst of energy.

When he settles down and looks at the view through the TV screen again, the demons around them are all burned and cleared out. Jimmy wonders for a brief second why Castiel didn't use the killing blow earlier, and also immediately, the sharp sensation from his skin and body rush into his consciousness. After the vast consumption of grace, it feels like a barrier is removed between his body and his mind. The pain is acute.

Jimmy moans at the pain that he's never felt before, staggering in his standing position, crushing down to floor, for he can feel both his legs must be broken during the fight. So are his arms. The body must has been cut, bitten, stabbed, and twisted out of place. Jimmy can't really see his own body, and Castiel doesn't seem to bother fixing any of that, but the pain sensor in his body is still functioning. And all the aching sensation is passing right to his consciousness.

Jimmy has to cover his mouth, just in case any of the moaning sound pass to Castiel's ears, just in case he annoys the angel. If he's the only one in his body, he's sure he would be falling to the ground, trembling in cold sweat and even stronger pain -- no, if he's only a human, he must have already been killed for a thousand times. Jimmy doesn't know if he should hate or thank Castiel.

They land on a solid ground without more obtrusion. -- It seems Hell does have a deepest Pit.

An old man grins with bad, rotten teeth, greeting darkly, "Angel."

Castiel answers, undisturbed, as if not noticing *anything* off with the body, "Demon."

"Not any demon," the old man corrects. He blinks, and his eyes and pupils turn to glassy yellow. "Azazel, at your service."

"Abomination," Castiel answers smoothly, not caring enough to use the demon's name. "Where is the Righteous Man?"

Jimmy focuses so much at the scene before him, that he temporarily forgets about the pained and wounded body. The demon named Azazel looks completely different from the other shapeless smoke-looking demons they have encountered before -- in face, Azazel can almost pass as a human, if not counting his yellow eyes, which makes the scene a hundred times worse. Those eyes almost look as if they are looking right past the eyes of Castiel, the eyes of his body, seeing through the fake TV screen and staring into Jimmy's consciousness, as if Azazel knows full well that he's in there. Jimmy drags himself behind the sofa, trying vainly to find some protection from the demon's view. The room feels colder than earlier.

*Castiel,* Jimmy thinks, not sure if it's a desperate wish or prayer, and he finds himself wordless of what to say. He rushes a thought, *Please be safe.*

Azazel grins wider, all the uneven and pointy teeth at the back of his mouth glinting dangerously. "My, my, where's the manner? It's been a thousand years since we see any angel down here. Direct to the business, are we?"

Castiel raises the blade in his hand. Jimmy can see black and red blood streaming from his own arm, and dripping through the blade.

The angel says, in a menacing tone, "I don't have all day. You can either give me the man we need, or I'll just find him myself."

Azazel shrugs carelessly. "Such impatience. Fine, you'll find him right --" he snaps a finger, "-- here."

Half a dozen torches start burning before them, showing a dimly lit room with a torture rack in the center. A wrecked body is bound to the rack, and a demon is cutting through the body with the sharpest and longest blade Jimmy has ever seen. The man on the reck is howling in pain and torture, and the demon is laughing hysterically. The mixed sound of laughter and cry gives Jimmy cold shivers and goosebumps all over.

Jimmy has to take a long deep breath to calm down his frantic heart. It is the most horrifying scene he's ever seen -- he doesn't even watch horror movies! -- but at least, good news for the man, the angel is here for him now. He almost feels relieved, at least he knows the angel is doing some good, saving poor people from Hell -- *he* is part of something good.

Castiel walks toward the rack. His voice prudent, "John Winchester?"

The demon turns his head, laughing even wilder. "Haven't heard that name in a million years," he says in a low croaked voice. His eyes and pupils are filled with black without any white.

Jimmy's heart sinks.

Azazel comments behind them, "It's actually three thousand years down here, dear. But I get it, it feels longer when you're enjoying it too much."

Castiel lowers his eyes, thinking.

Azazel continues to blatter, "I don't know why Heaven still bothers, he's completely one of us now. The first seal is broken anyway, we get what we want, you get what you want. Bob's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt. Everyone's happy, I deserve my reward. Honestly, it's not easy. You know how many centuries I have to spend teaching him how to pick up a razor?"

Castiel ignores him and starts walking outside. "He is broken beyond saving now," he convicts, "I will inform the General. Now, where is Lilith?"

"Wait, you're leaving?" Jimmy can't stop himself from calling out. "There's a man there! Being tortured! Even that demon, he used to be a man! You can still save them!"

Castiel keeps walking. The vision gets darker.

"Castiel!" Jimmy yells at the TV screen. "I thought you're an angel! I thought you're here to save people! Save them, please!"

"Quiet!" The radio bursts out Castiel's outrageous voice. So loud and high-pitched that it buzzes Jimmy's ears. The decorative windows in the living room crack in the vibration of the sound, before breaking into pieces and flying apart.

"No!" Jimmy covers his ears but doesn't want to give up just yet. The image and sound of the man's cry and the demon's laughter -- the human named John Winchester, the righteous man -- are still too vivid in his memory. He knows if he just let Castiel walk out of here, he will dream of them in nightmares from now on for eternity. "Doesn't the God say, *'Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act.'*\*?" (\* Proverbs 3:27)

Castiel snaps, "He is not here. I am. And no, there's no point. Michael told me to bring him his sword, but if it's too broken, he'll just go ahead find another. So it's the order."

"But --" Jimmy still tries.

"Jimmy, shut up," the angel cuts him off harshly, and the rage is audible from his voice.

Jimmy grimaces. The lines about the divine rage and God's wrath flash through his mind.

At the same time, a sharp pain way worse than those from the wounded limbs rushes his nerves, burning him as if his whole body and soul is being placed on the fire, prickling him as if every inch of his nerve has a long, sharp needle buried underneath. Jimmy curls on the floor and shakes involuntarily, gasping and panting, holding himself tight. But nothing helps. He doesn't even know where it comes from -- whether it's the body that he doesn't have control over, or his mind.

"I told you there will be punishment if you distract me," Castiel's ruthless voice comes through, cold and cruel.

"I'm sorry," Jimmy screams in between the shaking. "I'm sorry!"

Jimmy doesn't really know exactly when the pain eases. He thinks his consciousness must have blacked out. And by the time he comes to, he only feels cold. The smell of sulfur in the room is so thick that he thinks if it is real, he must will get poisoned by the chemical.

The TV screen shows long, endless spiral stairs heading downwards. Castiel is walking down those stairs, led by Azazel. The space is only lit by the shaking torch in Azazel's hand.

*Where are we going?* Jimmy thinks. But he is wise enough to not voice it now.

"Lord Lucifer would be so glad to see you," Azazel glances over his shoulder, grinning. "I mean, an angel coming to rescue? I really thought it would be a human, you know."

"I'm doing it on Michael's order," Castiel announces grimly.

"Sure, sure, whatever you say," Azazel turns back, leading the way. "But at the end of the day, you'll still be known as the angel that let Lucifer out. I don't know what the humans would think about that, but we demons? We own you a flag."

"For God's sake, we don't care what the humans think," Castiel snaps impatiently. "Will you shut up and just lead the way? Or do I have to burn your brain out and open the cage myself? I can do that too. Gladly."

"I thought you still need me to find Lilith," Azazel gloats.

Castiel grumbles, "I can kill my way to find her, too, if I have to."

But even Jimmy can hear the reluctance in his voice. Azazel doesn't push.

"Wait, *open the cage yourself*?" Jimmy can't help noticing and gasping again. "*You* are going to be the one starting the Apocalypse?"

"Apocalypse isn't going to start itself, is it?" Castiel's voice comes through sarcastically.

"No, but..." Jimmy's thought trails away. It feels wrong, but it does get mentioned in the Revelation that the Devil *will* come out of the prison after a thousand years. It just never occurs to him *how*, let alone *who* would make it happen. He wouldn't dare to dream it to be *himself* in another thousand years.

"What did I say about objections and distractions?" Castiel warns him lowly.

"Sorry," Jimmy apologizes hastily, already rushing toward the easy chair, ready to hold his body, as if preparing for another wave of pain. But fortunately not this time.

It almost feels like eternity before they reach the end of the stairs. The dark surrounding feels even darker and more doomful, if it's even possible.

A cubical-looking Cage is hanging in the space, chained with all the thickest and strongest iron chains. A demon stands below it, guarding.

She turns around when hearing their footsteps echo in the space. A bright smile crawls onto her face.

"Finally," she says brightly. "I thought you winged monkeys missed our signal flares."

"I'm the one suggested St. Mary's Convent," Azazel amends. "Just some personal preference. Oh, and a memorial place where I talked with Father."

"Enough talking," Castiel snaps. "We did not miss the signal. I was just, waiting for a vessel. Now, Lilith --"

The demon named Lilith, who, from Jimmy's view, looks nothing other than a young, innocent girl in pure white dress, smiles with a peaceful smile, looking into Castiel's eyes, and just so happened, meeting Jimmy's too. She looks beautiful and calm, and so, so, human -- if not counting the foggy white demon eyes.

Jimmy's heart skips a beat. He's not going to kill her, is he? Or in this case, is Castiel?

"I'm ready," Lilith announces, looking up at the Cage, opening her arms, like a little girl embracing the spring wind, or letting the light of autumn sun shining on her face. She closes her eyes.

Jarringly, Jimmy thinks she almost looks like Claire. His daughter might be just like that in a few years. He can imagine her wearing a similar white dress, standing in a park somewhere, letting the wind blowing the skirt, enjoying the sun. His heart clenches.

Castiel marches toward her, with the angel blade raised high in his hand.

"No!" Jimmy says suddenly.

Castiel's steady stride trips one step, his pace disturbed. But he carries on wordlessly.

The image of Lilith zooms larger in the vision by the second as he approaches.

"No!! You're not killing her. Stop!" Jimmy grabs the edge of the TV screen, focusing on his body, on his feet that is moving forward, on his hand that is holding the angel blade.

His body comes to a jolt.

"What's the matter?" Lilith opens her eyes, glancing at them.

"Trouble in that vessel?" Azazel observes keenly and sneers. "Didn't take you to be one that can't handle a little human."

"Jimmy, stop!" The murderous voice of the angel thunders in the imaginary living room, as if it doesn't just come from the radio, but from everywhere. The whole space shakes with the volume.

Jimmy has to loosen his grip to use the hands to cover his ears. "She's just a little girl. I can't kill her, not with my hands."

"She's not, she's a demon!" Castiel's thunderous voice shakes the space again. "And you're not, I'm doing it."

"It's still my body," Jimmy argues.

"Not anymore, you give it to me," Castiel reminds him.

"I can take it back," Jimmy blurts out.

"You don't mean it," Castiel warns dangerously. "Do you forget the pain fighting can give you?"

Jimmy flinches with reminded muscle memory of the pain.

With that split second of distraction, Castiel takes back control of the body and stabs the angel blade into the heart of Lilith.

She laughs as golden bright light bursts out of her body. Blood flows from the wound and winds on the ground like it has a life of its own, drawing a twisted sigil from an ancient unlocking spell that no one really knows.

Azazel lowers the torch, staring at the pattern with open fascination. "Oh Father, it's beautiful."

Castiel takes a step back, watching the Cage closely.

Light that is a million times brighter than Castiel's or the one that burns Lilith bursts out from the central of the blood sigil, beaming straight upward, tearing the dark space open, locking into the bottom of the Cage. It grows brighter and brighter as if a drill trying to punch through the barrier of the Cage.

Until eventually, the brightest light that is like supernova explosion blasts from the Cage.

That is when Jimmy closes his eyes, not wanting to see anything anymore. The Devil is out, the Apocalypse started. His hand has killed a girl and left two men rotten in Hell. What else does he need to know?

## Act 2

> Castiel leads the army to war, fight demons and sometimes humans if they're on his way, torture them for information, it's everything against what Jimmy wants. Their consciousness doesn't align, it causes Jimmy's nerve great pain. He begs Castiel to protect his wife and daughter, but Castiel doesn't care about humans, only focusing on the war. (Castiel hurts one of his eyes angelically)
>
> Jimmy tries to take back the consent, to cast Castiel out, he fights him in his brain, trying to escape, to rebel, for many times, to relieve the pain. Castiel warns him not to, taking back control every time. And when he fights again, he finally leaves.

<br>

###### [TBC]

## Act 3

> Jimmy thinks he's free, but his body is already ruined by angel grace. He can barely walk or run, he has pain all over his body. He's found by other angels on his way of escaping from angel camp.
>
> Other angels say, "Look, isn't that the vessel Castiel said didn't comply? Should we help him fix it?" They start to torture Jimmy.
>
> It's too painful for any human to bear. Jimmy can't help thinking if Castiel would come back to him. What did he do wrong? Does he have to be punished like this? He had given him everything, his body, his mind, his health, does he have to give up his last consciousness and his soul, too? *Castiel, why are you doing this to me? Are you not an angel?*

<br>

## Act 4

> It's supposed to be just *normal* torture, but when the angels start talking about breaking his brain so that the only thing he can think about is saying "yes", Castiel come back. He come back in Claire. He looks at Jimmy, and casts all those who tortured him out. Because he's still *his* vessel, they don't get to make decisions for him.
>
> He brings Jimmy to a lone deserted room, tells him to rest. Jimmy can't rest. He is watching Claire. Castiel tells him, "It's your daughter, I know. I found her at the edge of the war zone, wounded, dying." He continues, "I healed her. She will live even if I leave her now." But it doesn't matter, anyone incompetent to live will die. He didn't say it.
>
> Claire's coat is torn, looking like it's been through some massive explotions. But the lining is mostly intact, decent. But Jimmy cannot feel comforted.
>
> The dim room is quiet for a long time, Jimmy's mind starts drifting. He starts to wonder if the place they're in, this room, might be a decent hotel room before the Apocalypse. How many angels are there outside. Or maybe this is Castiel's secret base, there is no other angels. -- But could he be this kind? He had already known Castiel is not the caring angel he imagined him to be, he's just another coldblooded soldier, like the rest of them, maybe even more so -- he seems to be in a high rank, judging by the way other angels retreat and salute upon his arrival.
>
> He gives up trying to escape for a long time, he doesn't think he'll ever try it again. His nerve never stops aching in the days Castiel left him. He knows he can't get away, can't run to anywhere. It's his fate, his destiny, the way he'll die.
>
> Besides, if not him, who is going to be Castiel's next vessel, to endure all those pain he's been suffering? To suffer the unsufferable? Certainly can't be his daughter.
>
> He thinks, maybe the pain will stop once Castiel comes back inside him. He doesn't want Castiel wear his young daughter to the battlefield, but how could he ask, when he knows agony and nightmare will be all that's waiting for him?

<br>

## Act 5

> A sleepless night.
>
> When Castiel comes back to him the next day, Jimmy tells him, "Use me. Use me instead of my daughter. Take my daughter to somewhere safe. I won't question you again, I won't fight against you. I'm yours now, utterly and completely."
>
> Castiel doesn't want to use a young girl's body anyway. He brings Claire to the wild woods far from the hot zone --but it's just a zone they haven't spread to yet. It's just a matter of time.
>
> When he comes inside Jimmy, Jimmy thinks vaguely, his nerbe does stop aching. Because he can't feel anything at all anymore.

<br>

## Act 6

> It's like a deep sleep. He startles awake sometimes, by the faint pain in his brain and his nerves. He sees himself in impossible situations, in the middle of war. His body is torn apart, half his head is blown away by explosions. He'll die a hundred times as a human, but it seems only to be half a second de-sync angel's grace with his consciousness.
>
> The next time feels different. Castiel is not wounded, he's just lying on something, like an operational table. It's not pain that Jimmy is feeling, it's a numbness. He wants to stand up, but his body doesn't comply. He touches his head and finds an iron circle around his skull, long and short nails pinning inside his head. His hands tremble uncontrollably.
>
> He passes out from the horrible scene. The blackness followed is like falling. He thinks he sees Castiel's sinking consciousness on his way down. It's the darkness inside his mind, inside both their minds. Angel's mind is pinned by those iron nails, he's like a bird getting shot by the hunters. Falling straight down from the sky, with blood spreading from the wound, the feathers scattering. He barely has much feathers left, they are worn, detorted, hardened, more like blades than plumage.

<br>

## Act 7

> The last time Jimmy wakes up, is when Castiel is dying. Jimmy doesn't know where they are, but his mind comes clearer as Castiel's getting fainter. He feels pain, but not only in his mind, not only in his nerves. He feels the burning from angel's grace, the incineration of angel's grace combusting his body, his organs, his eyes and his brain. But before he dies, he sees the angel in a tan trench coat -- the one wearing the same face as his, it's "Castiel" killing him, killing them. But maybe, he has already died long before that.

<br>

### draft notes

> He goes to get into the humvee, but as he tries to climb into the cab, he is pulled out by Cas. Cas slams him into the side of the vehicle, punches him in the face and then holds his angel blade to his throat. he sees that Cas is his double.
>
> "More than one of us. Fascinating."
>
> Cas: "I've gotten used to it."
>
> "You align yourself with the humans."
>
> Cas "I vastly prefer them to angels."
>
> "Don't think that you are better than me. Well, we are the same."
>
> Cas: "Yes. We are."
>
> Cas stabs him with the angel blade. He screams and then dies with bluish-white light coming from his eyes and mouth. His body falls to the ground.

## Act 8

> The last consciousness of his drifts in the Empty. Jimmy wanders in the endless blackness, not feeling any pain, not any feelings, really. The numbness covers him, carries him.
>
> He kicks a man sleeping in his drifting. The man has his face, with the angel blade that killed them on his chest. Castiel looks up at him with eyes half-open, wordless. And he looks up, at the place where lights of souls are dropping like rainfalls.
>
> Jimmy sits down beside him, looking up at the falling souls from the bottomless darkness -- Heaven and Hell has long been destroyed in the war, homeless souls all come to the Empty. Everyone is falling to the Empty.
>
> By the time Jimmy looks back down, the tentacles of the Empty already covers half his body. And when he looks beside him, there is nothing and no one left. Swallowed by the Empty, Castiel is long gone.

*When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth -- Gog and Magog -- and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore. They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.*

*Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.*
