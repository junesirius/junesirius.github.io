> Castiel: Samandriel is being held in the general vicinity of Hastings, Nebraska.
>
> Dean: The general vicinity? That's all you got?
>
> Castiel: Yes, which is why I need your help. It seems this is gonna involve... talking to people.
>
> Dean: Come on, Cass, I thought you were a hunter now.
>
> Castiel: Well... I thought so, too, but... It seems I - I lack a certain -
>
> Dean: Skill?

> Castiel: I got what we need.
>
> Dean: (turning) Well, it's about time.
>
> Sam is standing next to Castiel.
>
> Dean: What's he doing here?
>
> Sam: Don't worry, Dean. Once we save Alfie, I'm out.
>
> Dean: Oh, once "we" save Alfie. Don't hurt yourself, Sam. Cass and I can handle it.
>
> Sam: Not according to Cass.
>
> Dean: I told you we didn't need him.
>
> Castiel: <u>We need *everything*, Dean. And I need both of you, as you say, to stow your crap. Can you do that?</u>
>
> Dean and Sam look at each other.

> Dean spreads goofer dust. Sam comes up behind him.
>
> Sam: So...what's our play?
>
> Dean: Well, you camp here, figure out who whored their soul. I'm gonna go scout the grounds - see if I can't gank Huckleberry Hound before he makes his next move.
>
> Sam: Wait, you're not going alone, Dean. I'm gonna come with you.
>
> Dean: Wrong.
>
> Sam: Uh, they're on lockdown, and you need backup.
>
> Dean: No, I don't.
>
> Sam: Yes, you do.
>
> Dean: No, I need you to be safe, Sam, okay? That's what I need.
>
> Sam: What? What am I - when are WE ever safe?
>
> Dean: This is different.
>
> Sam: How?
>
> Dean: Because of the three trials crap - God's little obstacle course. We've been down roads like this before, man - with Yellow-Eyes, Lucifer, Dick friggin' Roman. <u>We both know where this ends - one of us dies... Or worse.</u>
>
> Sam: <u>So, what - you just up and decided it's gonna be you?</u>
>
> Dean: I'm a grunt, Sam. You're not. You've always been the brains of this operation.
>
> Sam: Dean --
>
> Dean: And you told me yourself that you see a way out. <u>You see a light at the end of this ugly-ass tunnel. I don't.</u> But I tell you what I do know - it's that I'm gonna die with a gun in my hand. 'Cause that's what I have waiting for me - that's all I have waiting for me. I want you to get out. I want you to have a life - become a man of Letters, whatever. You, with a wife and kids and - and - and grandkids, living till you're fat and bald and chugging Viagra - that is my perfect ending, and it's the only one that I'm gonna get. So I'm gonna do these trials. I'm gonna do them alone - end of story. You're staying here. I'm going out there. If landshark comes knocking, you call me. If you try to follow me, I'm gonna put a bullet in your damn leg. (He walks away, we hear a door open)

> Sam: But I did... And I'm doing the rest of them.
>
> Dean: My ass you are!
>
> Sam: I'm closing the gates. It's a suicide mission for you.
>
> Dean: Sam...
>
> Sam: I want to slam hell shut, too, okay? But I want to survive it. I want to live, and so should you. You have friends up here, family. I mean, hell, you even got your own room now. You were right, okay? I see light at the end of this tunnel. And I'm sorry you don't - I am. But it's there. <u>And if you come with me, I can take you to it.</u>
>
> Dean: Sam, be smart.
>
> Sam: I AM smart, and so are you. You're not a grunt, Dean. You're a genius - when it comes to lore, to - you're the best damn hunter I have ever seen - better than me, better than dad. I believe in you, Dean. So, please - please believe in me, too.

> Dean: Cass, you got your ears on? Listen, you know I am not one for praying, 'cause in my book it's... it's the same as begging. But this is about Sam, so I need you to hear me. We are going into this deal blind... and I don't know what's ahead or what it's gonna bring for Sam. Now, he's covering pretty good, but I know that he is hurting, and this one was supposed to be on me. So, for all that we've been through, I'm asking you... (he's very earnestly praying) ...you keep a lookout for my little brother, okay? (He looks around beseechingly, shaking his head) Where the hell are you, man?

> Sam: That would explain the crazy room at Ann's house. (Dean sniffs) But how did they know where to start looking in the first place?
>
> Castiel: I don't know. I'm hoping the strange-haired demon in the kitchen is more knowledgeable than the others I interrogated. (Castiel gets up from the easy chair, goes into the kitchen through the swinging door)
>
> Dean: Well, he puts the "ass" in "Cass," huh?
>
> Sam: He's definitely off.
>
> Dean: Off? He hasn't been right since he got back from Purgatory. We still don't know how he got out of there.
>
> Sam: I don't know, Dean. If he's so sketchy, then why were you praying to him?
>
> Castiel (V.O.): <u>You know, I can hear you both. I am a celestial being.</u>

> Meg: You ever miss the Apocalypse? (She's drinking the liquor straight from the bottle)
>
> Castiel: No. Why would I miss the end of times?
>
> Meg: I miss the simplicity. I was bad. You were good. Life was easier. Now it's all so messy. I'm kind of good, which sucks. <u>And you're kind of bad -- which is actually all manner of hot.</u> We survive this... I'm gonna order some pizza and we're gonna move some furniture around. You understand?
>
> Castiel: No, I-I -- (Meg smiles suggestively) wait -- actually... Yes, I --

> Meg: Go. Save your brother... and my unicorn.

> *INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT*
>
> Naomi: If the demons get their hands on the Angel Tablet, they'll kill us all. They'll destroy heaven.
>
> Castiel: <u>I can reason with Dean. He's a good man.</u>
>
> Naomi: Kill him.

> *INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT*
>
> Castiel: <u>There has to be another way.</u>
>
> Naomi: You have done this a thousand times, Castiel. You're ready. Kill him. Then take the tablet and bring it home, where it belongs.

> *INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT*
>
> Dean: Just tell me how you got out of Purgatory. Be honest with me -- for the first time since you've been back -- (Dean nods towards the stone he's still holding) and this is yours. (Castiel's blade drops into his hand)

> *INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT*
>
> Close-up of the angel blade in Castiel's hand.
>
> Dean: Cass. Cass, I don't know what the hell is wrong with you, but if you're in there and you can hear me, you don't have to do this. (Castiel attacks, Dean blocks the blow with the stone) Cass! (Flashes of light, thunder rumbles)
>
> *INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT*
>
> Castiel: <u>This isn't right.</u> (Castiel paces around the room anxiously)
>
> Naomi: Do you realize what that tablet can do for us?
>
> Castiel: I...
>
> Naomi: For heaven?
>
> Castiel: <u>I won't hurt Dean.</u>
>
> Naomi: Yes. You will. You are.

> *INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT*
>
> Dean: Cass, fight this! This is not you! Fight it! (Castiel strikes again, Dean again uses the stone to block the blow. Thunder rumbles)

> *INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT*
>
> Dean: Cass! (Dean puts his hand on Castiel's shoulder. Castiel backhands Dean who is thrown into a wall and falls to the floor)

> *INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT*
>
> Castiel is attacking Dean. Dean throws a punch, Castiel grabs his forearm and breaks it. We hear the bone snap, Dean drops the stone, it shatters, revealing the tablet that was encased within. Lightning flashes.

> *INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT*
>
> Castiel is beating Dean. Dean's face is bruised and bloodied.
>
> Dean: You want it? (Castiel looks dispassionately at the now exposed tablet) Take it! <u>But you're gonna have to kill me first. Come on, you coward. Do it. Do it!</u> (Castiel continues to beat Dean)
>
> *INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT*
>
> Castiel, blade in hand, smacks Naomi's desk.
>
> Castiel: <u>Please.</u>
>
> Naomi: End this, Castiel.
>
> Castiel raises his fist in Naomi's office.

> *INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT*
>
> Castiel's fist follows through with a brutal punch to Dean.
>
> Dean: Cass... <u>This isn't you. This isn't you.</u> (Castiel raises his fist to attack Dean again)

> *INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT*
>
> Dean: Ohh! (Dean, seriously beaten and bloody, now has one eye swollen shut) Cass. Cass. (Weakly, reaching towards Castiel) I know you're in there. (Castiel raises his angel blade, ready to strike) I know you can hear me. Cass... (Dean's voice breaks, pleading) It's me. (Castiel stands there, blade at the ready, light glints off the blade) <u>We're family. We need you. I need you.</u>
>
> *INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT*
>
> Naomi: <u>You have to choose, Castiel -- us or them.</u>
>
> *INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT*
>
> Dean: Cass.
>
> Castiel drops the blade with a clang. Dean groans and pants in pain. Castiel reaches down for the angel tablet, as he picks it up, the Enochian writing begins to glow, the light flows up his arm, surrounding his entire being, the room, Dean.

> *INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT*
>
> Castiel is holding the angel tablet, standing over Dean.
>
> Dean: Cass? (Breathing heavily, he's horribly beaten) Cass? (Castiel reaches his hand towards Dean) No. Cass. Cass! (Castiel places his hand on the side of Dean's head, Dean gasps, and is suddenly healed)
>
> Castiel: I'm so sorry, Dean.
>
> Dean: What the hell just happened? (All trace of the beating is gone)
