For years, Dean mocks at Castiel's ruffle unraveling sex hair - well, maybe not out loud in front of him, certainly not in the first few years after they first met, but he for sure thinks that. He had that thought at the first sight of the angel, even though he didn't say anything (didn't dare, didn't feel that was the right circumstance, and he was right). And from Castiel's perspective, Dean isn't really a quiet thinker. Thoughts bump around all the time, he doesn't even need to jump into his head, Castiel can hear it loud and clear. "Sex hair," the term wanders around in Dean's head. With everything happening at that time, with the apocalypse and Lucifer and Lilith and Colt and Dean in mind, Castiel didn't think to bring it up either.

Truth is, Dean caught him at the most inconvenient time.

Well, not *him* him per se, it's actually Jimmy Novak's fault in that sense, but still, who can blame a man for enjoying some little family time at night with his wife after they finally put their daughter to bed and finished all the laundry and dishes and whatever house chore they have to do, and enjoy a quiet moment of contentment knowing he is with his family, safe and sound, loving and loved. And *that* is when Dean Winchester chose to call.

At the middle of the night, in the barn, Dean didn't really think about the timing issue. Not in the normal human sense anyway. That's just a time he gets used to working with demons and most of the nocturnal supernatural creatures, and that is a time when Sam isn't around objecting to his stupid plan and away with his alleged midnight meal.

Dean and Bobby called. That little ritual they pulled up, well, truth be told, what they thought was a summoning or binding spell, is more or less like a phone call for Castiel - even if he never owned a phone in his millions of years of life, he knows the concept. The ringtone echoes in his multidimensional celestial brain, and Castiel decides it's a good time to finally meet Dean Winchester, the human he saved, the human in his charge, and the human with a big plan and great responsibility in the coming war. Well, it is *not*. It's not a good time for Jimmy Novak anyway, it's the worst time at all.

When the sacred voice sounds up in his brain, Jimmy is more than a little startled - he could have a fucking heart attack if he's not a young strong healthy man.

"A little warning ahead of time would be appreciated." Jimmy thinks to himself - actually, more like to the voice in his head.

Castiel tilts his head and squints his eyes - he doesn't have a head or eyes at that moment technically, but Jimmy perceives the motion just fine. He sighs, retreats from his wife, and gathers all the brain power and strength he could find to drag himself out of bed.

He had said "yes" to Castiel before - in general, not in this specific awkward moment. Why does the angel have to pick now of all time? Jimmy thinks desperately to himself, heading to the bathroom to find something to dress. He's sweaty, sticky with liquid he wouldn't want anyone to know what, not even the all-knowing angel that is about to be inside of him.

"I didn't pick the time, the mission did." Castiel answers Jimmy's not-question, "I need to go, *now*."

Jimmy sighs, again, "Give me a minute."

He doesn't take just one minute, he takes three.

If Dean ever wonders why it takes three minutes after their ritual for Castiel to show up, here's the answer - it takes two minutes and fifty-nine seconds for Jimmy Novak to quickly wipe his face (and body) and suit up, and a blink for Castiel to fly to the barn. So Dean probably wouldn't actually want to know all the truth and details.

Jimmy would really like to take a shower, but Castiel is getting increasingly impatient by the end of the second minute. He doesn't like keeping people waiting, especially not Dean Winchester.

Even the firefighters have a seven-minute average reaction time. Jimmy thinks.

"I can take care of the cleanness if it matters so much to you." Castiel offers. And upon Jimmy's nod, he is inside of him and outside of the barn an instant later.

Castiel *does* miracle his body clean, to some extent, as promised. But not to every detail. He doesn't know all the unspoken human attire rules - even if he does, he probably wouldn't pay much attention either. This is the first time in two thousand years that he walks among humans (not accounting for the only other time a hundred years ago, everything isn't quite the same from that time either), he needs to be careful not to accidentally burn Dean's eyes out or deafen him with his true voice. He certainly has no extra attention to his vessel appearance.

That is why he looks like what he looks like when Dean Winchester lays eyes on him. The messed-up unraveling hair and loose tie are telling one story, the straight serious face and grave voice are telling another. Dean hears both, and he should get credit for being able to focus on the second one without making one single smug joke about the first.

Because after all, for once, Dean is right about why the sex hair is called that name. And for once, Dean Winchester hopes he's wrong.

As for how Dean finally finds out the truth behind all that, that is a different story he and a certain angel wouldn't want anyone to know, just about as much as Jimmy Novak wouldn't want others to know.
