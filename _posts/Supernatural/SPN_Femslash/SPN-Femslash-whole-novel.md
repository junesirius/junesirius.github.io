## Draft

### Initial thoughts

(inspired by *Transcendence*)

Charlie has been uploading her brain info to bunker computer, basically turns herself into a big AI with her own memory & intelligence built-in, but not waken yet (after 1022 unexpected death, her initial plan is to wake it by herself to test/have fun/help boys around the bunker) (←TFW find Charlie's journal/notebook)

Alicia Banes is a twig/twine doll after 1220, live like that for three years (post-1520) but can't bear it anymore (impervious, un-human, can self-heal, out of place, hiding from human society (TFW thought it's bc herself, but actually bc Max); Max depressed, cursed to Hell, want to release Max from demon deal (Sam/Dean parallel S3) when Max die she'll die too, so Max doesn't let her), so she goes to bunker alone looking for help (hide from Max), start reading archives but lose patience, hope the bunker computer has easy archive, go poke, find out it's manually recently modified, go digging, restart, trigger Charlie's consciousness awake, start talking in bunker, startle TFW (subtly indicate Cas is still around & destiel)

TFW talk to Charlie for a bit, miss her, guilty, this version is uploaded before her death event (even before the whole decrypting event), so she doesn't know, it never happens to her (TFW still guilty but relieved) (TFW has to leave bunker for a while? out hunting some small things but leave bunker to them←take them out of story; also give a reason why can't just let Jack fix them)

some discussions about life form, what is life, whether Charlie should be considered dead/revived, what's this form vs soul living form, Cas to confirm her soul is indeed still in Heaven, with all memories but can't create new ones, this AI version is more alive/living; to make AI!Charlie more legit, Cas go to Heaven ask if her original soul is okay with that, soul!Charlie: "if I know anything about myself" she's ok with it, even just for curiosity about the experiment←hint for ending)

both are basically consciousness in wrong/no body (philosophic discussion of "what is life"), held together by tech/magic, just need to figure out a normal-ish body (inspired by *Cyberpunk 2077*) to become human again. Charlie suggests to make herself a twig/twine doll body too but everyone vote it down (and need her heart but they already burned). Alicia suggests to upload her own brain to bunker computer (since Charlie already know how to do it), good for backup too in case twig stop working (or to release Max as early as possible, Max already dying?/chased by demon/hellhound? twin have hellhound case?), seem no reason not to, so start the process (Max finds out Alicia is in bunker some time around this, so he comes too)

Alicia enter Charlie's sci-fi version world (visual from 2077/San Junipero), two girl time, talk in AI-type wavelength-only human-incomprehensible pitch (inspired from that post in qzone), TFW+Max amazed and continue digging books, the two girls searching the whole internet; because of isolated and bored, talking more, getting close, start have desire, want to touch physically (getting slightly more sexual or hinting that direction)

Max reuse Rowena's spell, throw Witch's ring in for full power, create two bodies for them (also release himself from spell); upload data/consciousness to the body, initially accidentally swapped, make cute fun remarks (still kiss, hug, can't wait); re-upload/swap, hold hands, "that's so much better"

"Hi" "Hi" "I'm Charlie" "Alicia" "Nice to meet you, for the first time" "I love you" "I know"
