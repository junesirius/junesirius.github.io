Been thinking about the different time flow in different locations.

From S4 we know 1 month on Earth = 10 years in Hell (4 months for Sam is 40 years for Dean)

From S8 we know 1 year on Earth = 1 year in Purgatory (1 year for Sam is 1 year for Dean and Cas)

From S15 we know roughly 1 minute on Heaven = 10 years on Earth (roughly 4 minutes of playing "Carry on my wayward son" in Dean's drive is about 40 years for Sam, give or take)

So Earth has same time flow as Purgatory, Hell has the slowest, Heaven has the fastest, which sort of makes sense.

<br>

So now we can do the math:

When 1 minute passes in Heaven, that's equal to 10 years on Earth, or 10 years in Purgatory, or 1200 years in Hell.

Probably shouldn't be surprised that those souls and demons are twisted so much in Hell then.

And, say Cage has the same time flow speed as the rest of the Hell:

Sam's soul has been in Cage for 1 year with Lucifer from Earth's time, meaning he's really there 120 years in Hell's time, butchered and tortured by Lucifer. No wonder he's traumatized and broken beyond repair.

Adam and Michael have been in Cage for 10 years in Earth's time (from S5 to S15), meaning they are really there 1200 years in Cage. All those times with only the two of them together, no wonder they become best buddies.

Lucifer has been in Cage since at least two thousand years ago in Earth's time, that's 24,000 years in Cage. That's practically eternity. No wonder he's the way he is, even if he didn't start off evil.

Everything makes so much sense now, taking the scale of time into consideration.
