> Mandy smiles at Cass, Cass is confused.
>
> Mandy: And how 'bout you, handsome?
>
> Castiel: Um, uh (he studies his menu) uh, Sunrise Special, please.
>
> Mandy: (smiling brightly) Nice.
>
> Dean: <u>(leaning across the table to talk to Cass) Oh, dude, she is into you.</u>
>
> Mary: Dean...
>
> Dean: <u>No, this is good. We've been looking for teachable moments. This... (clicks tongue)</u>

> Dean: <u>Cass, here's the thing you need to know about waitresses, okay? They get hit on all day long, so you gotta bring your A game. But, upside? (clicks tongue) They always smell like food.</u>

> Sam: Incoming. (clears throat)
>
> Mandy leans between Mary and Cass to refill a coffee cup, Cass leans over to sniff her shoulder, and “Walk With A Winner” by Gene McDaniels plays softly.
>
> Dean: <u>Hey, Mandy. Question for you. My shy but devastatingly handsome friend here was, uh, just wondering, when do you get off?</u>
>
> Mandy: Whenever I can. (she smiles at Cass)
>
> Dean: <u>Hey-o!</u>
>
> Wally: (stifling laugh) Zing!
>
> Dean: <u>Point 1 for her. Just dropped that on the table.</u>
>
> Wally: Right in front of all of us, too.
>
> Dean: Ooh-hoo!

> A bell dings twice, and <u>Dean and Cass share a glance.</u>

> *Title Card: THE WOUNDED ANGEL*
>
> Organ music plays, Castiel is sitting in his truck listening to the radio.
>
> Radio: Each of us has a time the physical body dies. We all face God's judgment in the end. There's not one of us alive walking on this earthly plane that will not pay the consequence for their actions.
>
> The Impala pulls into the parking lot, distracting Cass from the radio.
>
> Radio: The Lord will hold us in the palm of his hand, and he'll weigh our souls. Brothers and sisters, are you worthy?
>
> Cass turns off the radio.

> Slo-mo Reservoir Dogs style walk across the parking lot.

> Mary runs out the back door of the house, Castiel is thrown out the window a moment later.
>
> Cass crawls across the back lawn, injured, while whistling western music reminiscent of 6.18 plays and the demon pursues him.
>
> Demon: Been a long time since I've seen an angel. Yeah. (he pulls a lance out of thin air behind his back)
>
> Demon: (readying the lance) Ah. But not long enough.
>
> Cass is lying in the road as the demon pierces his side with the lance. Cass continues to try to crawl away.
>
> Demon: Where do you think you're going, huh?
>
> The demon laughs as Cass desperately tries to escape now.
>
> Demon: (stalking Cass with his spear raised) Come on.
>
> Cass crawls to the edge of the road, and a Jeep hits the demon, sending him flying. Mary gets out of the Jeep and collects Cass.

> Cass just looks pained and pants heavily.
>
> Cass examines his wound, bleeding heavily, and closes his eyes in pain.

> Sam and Dean barge into the barn where Mary and Cass are holed up.
>
> Cass grunts in pain.
>
> Dean: <u>Cass?</u>

> Castiel groans again.
>
> Dean: <u>Cass.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Hey. Wow. You look like hammered crap.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Yeah, that sounds about right.</u>

> Dean: <u>Let's see.</u>
>
> <u>Cass lifts his shirt to reveal the wounds, and Dean rears back, shocked before reaching out to cover it again.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>All right. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, hey, you know what? I've had worse.</u>
>
> Castiel: Oh, yeah? When? Dean, something's wrong. I... I can't heal myself. I think the... I think the demon's s-spear was poisoned. <u>I don't... I-I think I'm dying.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>No. No, you just need some time, okay? You'll heal up the old fashioned way.</u>
>
> Sam: (in the background) Mom, what the hell did you get us into?
>
> Dean: <u>Sam. Sammy!</u>
>
> Sam and Mary come over to see Cass groaning and suffering.

> *Title Card: MR. CROWLEY*
>
> Crowley: For that, I apologize. But I do come bearing gifts. The first is from all demonkind. We heard you collect weapons- the more ancient and arcane, the better. So may I present, the Lance of Michael, the Archangel. (Crowley's associate removes the drape from the lance and presents it to Ramiel)
>
> Ramiel: Impressive. <u>This beauty, she kills the bad ones fast, and the good ones slow and painful.</u>
>
> Crowley: <u>Ironic, seeing as it was made by an angel.</u>
>
> Ramiel: <u>There's only one angel Michael wanted to kill, and he wanted that son of a bitch to suffer.</u> Ah, the magic. It's all in the rune work. The craftsmanship. Oh.

> Crowley: Brings me to your final gift -- the Throne of Hell.
>
> Ramiel: (scoffs and closes the box) You want me to be king?
>
> Crowley: Well, with Lilith and Azazel dead, and Lucifer back in his box, we need a ruler. You are next in line, Ramiel. Prince of Hell.
>
> Ramiel: It's just a name. Doesn't mean anything.
>
> Crowley: Still, the crown is yours if you want it.
>
> Ramiel: <u>I don't. You take it.</u>
>
> Crowley: <u>I... Pardon?</u>
>
> Ramiel: <u>You seem ambitious enough, conniving enough, slimy enough. So, take it! Go for the glory, kid.</u>
>
> Crowley: I mean, <u>one dares to dream</u>, but what about the others? You're not the only Prince.
>
> Ramiel: Azazel was a fanatic, a true believer in Lucifer's master plan. But the rest of us? Well, the truth is, we stopped caring a long time ago. <u>Asmodeus has his hobbies. Dagon has her toys.</u> We're happy where we are. So if you want the crown, it's yours. Otherwise... (Ramiel looks to Crowley's associate, who looks eager to accept)
>
> Demon: Oh, hell ye --
>
> Crowley: <u>I'll take it. I mean, I graciously accept.</u> (the other demon rolls her eyes)

> Crowley: Nasty bit of business. Kills everything it touches. If you're a demon, you go up in a puff of smoke. If you're an angel, you just... rot away. <u>Sorry, Castiel.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>No. No. There's a cure. There's always a cure, and we will find it.</u>

> Crowley: It took you years to defeat Lucifer, and the power of God to stop the Darkness. Maybe if you had more time, you could manage Ramiel. But right now, in this barn... <u>Hey, I was growing fond of the choir boy, too.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Shut up. Shut up. We don't have time, okay, for your -- for you.</u> So either help us or get the hell out of here!
>
> Crowley disappears.
>
> Dean: Yeah, figures.

> Crowley: <u>What can I do to keep you out of that barn?</u>
>
> Ramiel: I smell the angel. He's rotting. These people -- they your friends?
>
> Crowley: <u>I don't have friends. I make deals with those I can use. Every kingdom needs allies, even Hell.</u>
>
> Ramiel: Allies. Is that what you call three humans with one good liver between them and a busted up angel?
>
> Crowley: <u>I admit they don't sound like much. But every Armageddon, every bloody, “this is the end of all things,” a Winchester stopped it. Like it or not, they're an asset we can't afford to lose.</u>
>
> Ramiel: We had an agreement, Crowley. No one bothers us. You remember?
>
> Crowley: We made one deal. <u>Let's make another.</u>

> Cass groans and coughs.
>
> Dean: Cass, how bad is it?
>
> Cass groans and writhes in pain, loosening his tie and pulling aside his collar to show the damage from his wound spreading across his chest.
>
> Castiel: Crowley's right. <u>You should go.</u>
>
> Dean: Cass, come on.
>
> Castiel: <u>No, you listen to me. You -- Look, thank you. Thank you. Knowing you, it... it's been the best part of my life. And the things that... (inhales sharply) the things we've shared together, they have changed me. You're my family. I love you. I love all of you. Just please... please, don't make my last moments be spent watching you die. Just run. Save yourselves. And I will hold Ramiel off as long as I can.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Cass, no.</u>
>
> Castiel: Yes. You need to keep fighting.
>
> Sam: We are fighting. We're fighting for you, Cass.
>
> Dean: <u>And like you said, you're family. And we don't leave family behind.</u>
>
> <u>Cass cries softly.</u>

> Cass screams in agony and Sam throws the lance down and runs to his side.
>
> Sam: <u>Cass. Hey, buddy. Hey, we're here, Cass. (black goo flows from Cass's mouth, and he's clearly dying) We're right here, buddy.</u>
>
> Crowley gets up from where he'd been lying by the tractor, and picks up the lance. He studies it, and looks over to see Cass dying, with Mary, Sam, and Dean crouched around him. He remembers what Ramiel had said about the lance, and flashes back to...
>
> Ramiel: Ah, the magic. It's all in the runework. The craftsmanship.
>
> Sam: <u>Hang in there, all right? What do we do?</u>
>
> Crowley snaps the lance in half, releasing a blinding flash of light. Cass glows with it, and as it fades he's cured. Everyone looks at Crowley, stunned.
>
> Crowley: The magic's in the craftsmanship.
>
> Crowley stares at the broken lance as if even he can't believe that worked.
>
> Dean: <u>Cass?</u>
>
> Crowley: Oh. You're welcome.
>
> Crowley drops the broken lance and disappears.

> Mary: So... you're good?
>
> CAS: I guess so. What did he... what did he mean about somebody stealing from him?
>
> Mary is about to say something, but Dean speaks first.
>
> Dean: Who knows what that crazy man was talking about. <u>Let's go home.</u>
