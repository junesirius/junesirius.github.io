> Castiel: I know you're there. I can feel you.
>
> Cosmic Entity: Hello.
>
> The camera moves to reveal... a Castiel Doppelganger. The Cosmic Entity has shifted into a perfect copy of Castiel.
>
> Castiel: What are you?
>
> Cosmic Entity: Oh, I'm just your friendly neighborhood cosmic entity.
>
> Castiel: Why do you look like me?
>
> Cosmic Entity: Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Well, I show up in my real form, and you freak out, rip out your own eyes, et cetera. That would be embarrassing, wouldn't it? For both of us.
>
> Castiel: What is this place?
>
> Cosmic Entity: Oh, yes. Excellent question. You see, before God and Amara, creation, destruction, Heaven, Hell, your precious little Earth, what was there?
>
> Castiel: Nothing.
>
> Cosmic Entity: Yes. That's right. <u>Nothing. Nothing but Empty. And you are soaking in it. Angels and demons, you all come here when you die.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Every angel that ever died is here?</u>
>
> Cosmic Entity: Yes, <u>sleeping an endless peaceful sleep.</u> You know I... I was sleeping, too. Hey, uh, since we're pals, there's something I've gotta know. I've just gotta ask. Hmm. Why are you awake? 'Cause fun fact -- <u>in all of forever, nothing ever wakes up here. I mean, ever. Ever.</u> And second fun fact -- <u>when you woke up, I woke up, and I don't like being awake.</u> So... what's up, smart guy?
>
> Castiel: I don't know.
>
> Cosmic Entity: Well, think!
>
> Castiel: <u>The Winchesters. Sam and Dean, they must've made a deal.</u>
>
> Cosmic Entity: No. No, no, no. Not with me, and I'm -- I'm the only one that has any pull here. Not Heaven, not Hell, not G-O-D himself. So think harder. (He aggressively pokes Castiel's forehead) Rack that perky little brain of yours.
>
> Castiel: Stay away from me.
>
> Cosmic Entity: Okay, fine. I'll rack it for you.
>
> The Cosmic Entity puts a hand on Castiel's head. Castiel screams in pain.

> Castiel is on the floor, breathing heavily.
>
> Castiel: What did... What did you do to me?
>
> Cosmic Entity: I-I read your mind, such as it is.
>
> Castiel: What do you want?
>
> Cosmic Entity: <u>What do I want? I want you to shut up. I want -- hmm. Having you awake, it's like a gnat flew right up here and it's trapped and it's buzzing.</u>
>
> Castiel: Having me awake causes you pain.
>
> Cosmic Entity: <u>If you can't sleep, I can't sleep. Yeah? And I like sleep. I need sleep.</u>
>
> Castiel: Then get rid of me.
>
> Cosmic Entity: Oh, I should, should I?
>
> Castiel: <u>Send me back to Earth.</u>
>
> Cosmic Entity: Or I throw you so deep into the Empty that you can't bother me anymore, hmm?
>
> Castiel: Except you know that won't work, or you would've done it already.
>
> Cosmic Entity: Pretty smart. Pretty smart, dummy.
>
> Castiel: <u>Send... Me... Back.</u>
>
> Cosmic Entity: That's not part of the deal. No, no. Besides, you don't want to go back.
>
> Castiel: <u>Yes, I do. Sam and Dean need me.</u>
>
> Cosmic Entity: Oh, save it. I have tiptoed through all your little tulips. <u>Your memories, your little feelings, yes. I know what you hate. (whispers) I know who you love... what you fear. There is nothing for you back there. No. Here. Let me show you.</u>
>
> The entity touches Castiel's head. Castiel screams.
>
> <u>We see some FLASHBACKS: Metatron stealing Castiel's grace; Lucifer killing Castiel; Castiel walking into the lake after the Leviathans took over; Castiel returning the souls he stole from Purgatory; Castiel lying on the floor, seemingly dead, after returning the souls.</u>
>
> Castiel yells.

> Castiel is on the floor.
>
> Cosmic Entity: Come on, Castiel! <u>Wouldn't you rather be a fond memory than a constant, festering disappointment?</u>
>
> The entity kicks Castiel.
>
> Cosmic Entity: <u>Just let's lay down. Let's just try and sleep. Hmm? Think about it. Infinite peace, yes? No regrets. No pain. Kiddo, save yourself.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>I'm already saved.</u>
>
> The entity kicks him again. <u>Castiel slowly stands up.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>You can prance and you can preen and you can scream and yell and remind me of my failings but somehow, I'm awake. And I will stay awake and I will keep you awake until we both go insane.</u>
>
> The entity punches him.
>
> Castiel: <u>I will fight you. Fight you and fight you for... ever. For eternity.</u>
>
> Cosmic Entity: No. No.
>
> Castiel: <u>Release me. Release... me.</u>
