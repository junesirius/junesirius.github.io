> The demons leave. Lucifer approaches Crowley and pokes him with a staff.
>
> Lucifer: How are your wounds, doggy?
>
> Crowley: They are... no less than I deserve.
>
> Lucifer scratches Crowley's head.
>
> Lucifer: (Croons) Aww, you're scared of your Master. That's a good doggy.
>
> Lucifer grabs Crowley's ear and pulls his head up.
>
> Lucifer: But it's an act. I broke you, but um... (smells him) Yep, I can still smell it, you've got that delectable little whiff of defiance, you're just playing, huh? Waiting for your moment to retake the throne? Am I right?
>
> Crowley: Yes, sir.
>
> Lucifer: Well, then. <u>Tell me, once and future king of Hell, you've been watching my role, what treasonous thoughts do you have brewing in that little head of yours, huh?</u>
>
> Crowley is silent. Lucifer hits him lightly over the head.
>
> Lucifer: What are you really thinking? Hmm?
>
> Crowley: The truth, sir?
>
> Lucifer: Yeah.
>
> Crowley: You're not strong enough. You had your weapons delivered, you realize they won't be enough. If you thought you could beat Amara you'd be taking the fight to her! Right now.
>
> Lucifer: You're a clever little doggy. You're right, at the moment, I may be a bit under-equipped. Maybe defeating Amara was a bit more of a team effort than I led certain people to believe. All that said, I'm still your Master, did I let you out of that kennel too soon?
>
> Lucifer'S phone rings.
>
> Crowley: (whispers) No.
>
> Lucifer: No barking. It's showtime.
>
> Lucifer answers the phone, and grimaces as he imitates Castiel's voice.
>
> Lucifer: Hello Dean.

> Lucifer cuts up ingredients for the spell, and puts them into a metal bowl in front of him. Sam enters.
>
> Sam: Hey. Cass, what is that?
>
> Lucifer: It's your spell of gathering.
>
> Sam: You nuts? You're not strong enough Cass, you could get hurt!
>
> Lucifer: You find a better option?
>
> Sam: Well, no, but... without a serious boost to your angel power, that spell won't even work!
>
> Lucifer: My strength may surprise you.
>
> Sam: Wait a second. I remember Bobby told me when you needed strength to retrieve us from the past, you used him to power up, you touched his soul, right?
>
> Lucifer: That's right, I did that. But that procedure can be fatal.
>
> Sam: <u>Use my soul. That way maybe you'll have enough power to wield the spell.</u>
>
> Lucifer: That isn't necessary.
>
> Sam: <u>It's worth the risk. Cass, Dean needs our help. I trust you.</u>

> Lucifer smiles, then starts laughing.
>
> Sam: (confused) What?
>
> Lucifer: Oh, it's just - I don't need you anymore. I mean, Dean's the one with the link to Amara, why have I been trying to spare you? <u>I mean maybe it's because you're like the girl who kept turning me down at the prom.</u>
>
> Lucifer grabs Sam and slams him against one of the Bunker's support columns.
>
> Lucifer: I will touch your soul. Just because you asked so nicely, and I'll use your spell to blast through the warding and retrieve Dean and the uh, Hand of God, and then when Dean comes back and he finds this place decorated with your guts, I will tell him the truth, Sam. I'll just say, 'Dean - ' <u>(pauses and smiles, before putting on his Castiel voice)</u> \- 'Dean... he knew the risks. He wouldn't take no for an answer.'
>
> Sam: Lucifer.
>
> Lucifer: In the flesh.
>
> Sam looks horrified, as Lucifer puts his hand in to touch Sam's soul. Sam yells agony. Lucifer looks as though he is savoring the moment, until all of a sudden his expression changes, and he withdraws his hand and releases Sam, who falls to the ground unconscious. <u>Lucifer looks at his hand as an angelic ringing becomes audible.</u>
>
> Lucifer: (with a slightly strained expression) <u>Hello Castiel.</u>

> Sam is still on the floor, regaining consciousness. He slowly sits up as Castiel falls onto the floor beside him. Sam tries to get away from him.
>
> Sam: No, no!
>
> Castiel: (Struggling to hold Lucifer back) Sam, it's me.
>
> Sam: Cass? Why?
>
> Castiel: <u>I wanted to be of service to the fight.</u> And only Lucifer can beat her.
>
> Sam: You chose this? You have to fight, Cass! Eject him now!
>
> Castiel: I can't! <u>It's taking all my strength to keep him from killing you.</u> And besides, we need him!
>
> Sam: No Cass, we don't. We'll find another way to stop Amara!
>
> Castiel: (shakes his head) <u>We need him to save Dean.</u>
>
> Sam: You can't time travel.
>
> Castiel: (shakes his head again) Only Lucifer can.

> Sam: Dean - THAT'S NOT CASS!
>
> Dean stares at Sam, then looks at Lucifer. <u>A sheepish, gleeful look crosses Lucifer's face.</u>
>
> Lucifer: Cat's out!
>
> Lucifer throws Dean across the table, and Dean lands on the floor on the other side of the table, against the wall.
>
> Lucifer: I feel a burden lifted. You know, this whole - deep cover thing - it just wasn't - it wasn't terribly well thought out. Donning this - this Cass mask? <u>This grim face of angelic constipation?</u> It just - ugh. And then, teaming up with you two. I mean, I thought you boys were insufferable as mortal enemies, but working with you. That's the soul crusher.
>
> Unbeknownst to Lucifer, Sam manages to get out his knife, and cuts the palm of his hand. Dean tries to stand up, but Lucifer telekinetically pins him up against the wall.
>
> Lucifer: Why the faces, boys? You should be cheering.
>
> Sam works on painting a sigil with his blood on the wall behind him while Lucifer is distracted.
>
> Lucifer: We have a common enemy. With this (holds up the Hand of God, still wrapped in cloth), she will be no problem. I mean, I will have killed you both by then, but still. Come on.
>
> Lucifer unwraps the Hand of God. Dean watches him, horror-struck.
>
> Dean: No! (Lucifer touches the Hand of God, and holds it) NO!
>
> Lucifer closes his eyes as he waits for the effects of the power to come. He frowns when nothing happens. Dean looks from him to Sam and back, worried and confused.
>
> Lucifer: (angrily) It's kicked!
>
> A look of slight relief comes over Dean's face.
>
> Dean: Well. Who'd've thought the Hand of God would turn out to be a one-hitter?
>
> Lucifer tosses the Hand of God onto the table, and angrily advances toward Dean, who is still pinned to the wall. At the last second, Sam places his hand on the angel-banishing sigil, and Lucifer disappears with a yell. Sam and Dean look at each other, relieved, but also devastated.

> Sam: So.
>
> Dean: So. Cass.
>
> Sam: Yeah. What do we do?
>
> Dean: What else? We hunt Lucifer, trap the bastard, and save Cass.
>
> Sam: Like I said. Lucifer may be in control now, but <u>Cass may not come back willingly. I mean he chose it.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>No. No, not possible.</u>

> Dean: Yeah, Sam. You think I don't know that? We've done nothing but mainline lore for a week, okay? We've got jack on another hand of God and Amara, and we've got even less jack on how to save Cass.
>
> Sam: If he wants to be saved.
>
> Dean: <u>He does... even if he doesn't know it yet.</u>
>
> Sam: Dean...

> Sam: Dean, you know what? He made a bad decision. We've been there.
>
> Dean: Yeah, you, me, now Cass.
>
> Sam: Dean, <u>we'll get him back. We will. We just got to...</u>
>
> Dean: Keep grinding. No matter how much it hurts, no matter how hard it gets, you got to keep grinding.
>
> Sam: Right.
>
> Dean: And that's how we're gonna win. And we're gonna win. <u>We're gonna save Cass</u>, we're gonna ice the Devil and we're gonna shank the Darkness. And anyone that gets in our way, well, God help them.
>
> Sam: Damn right.
>
> Dean: Damn right.

> Sam: Listen, um... I know I came down on the side of wanting Cass to deal with Amara, so...
>
> Dean: Well, that's what he wanted, though, right? Besides, didn't we say that we were gonna swear off getting in the way when one person makes a choice the other doesn't agree with?
>
> Sam: Yeah, um... Yeah, we did say that.
>
> Dean: So...
>
> Sam: Okay. So, that's our policy.
>
> Dean: Which sounds damn good. (Sam chuckles) Well, <u>let's go find that idiot and bring him home.</u>

> Lucifer: (mocking) <u>You really thought you could double-cross me? Me?</u>
>
> Lucifer walks towards Crowley, stopping to pick up a book from one of the shelves.
>
> Lucifer: <u>You know I invented the double-cross. Like literally.</u> Of course, I couldn't have orchestrated all of this without the lovely, talented Simmons here.
>
> Lucifer is standing right in front of Crowley now, with Simmons by his side.
>
> Lucifer: She, um, she hates you, B-T-Dubs.
>
> Simmons: Yeah. I really do.
>
> Lucifer: Yeah, they all do. Like, every demon in Hell. Can't really blame them, can you? I mean, maybe once you were the evilest evil that ever eviled... present company excluded. But <u>now... you're nothing but Dean Winchester's number-one fan.</u>

> Lucifer: I knew you were hiding something. I could see that last spark of defiance in your eyes. (Lucifer grabs hold of Crowley's jacket, pulling him closer) And rather than beating it out of you, which... doable, but messy... I let you lead me here. (He pushes Crowley out of the way) So I'm gonna take this... (Lucifer taps the box and turns to face Crowley)... and then I'm gonna take you. And, oh, puppy, you're not gonna like what comes next.
>
> Lucifer moves the box and then opens it to find it empty. He closes the lid, an angry sneer on his face, and turns to look at Crowley, who is now holding a wooden staff in his hand.
>
> Crowley: You looking for this?
>
> Crowley hits Lucifer with the staff and he falls to the ground. Simmons rushes to his side.
>
> Crowley: <u>you really think you could double-cross me? Me?! I perfected the double-cross. Like, literally.</u>
>
> Crowley looks at the staff, which is now glowing red, He laughs. Lucifer gets to his feet and watches as the red glow extends to Crowley's face and hands as he absorbs the power from the Hand of God.
>
> Crowley: So this is what it feels like to be God. Not bad. Tingly. So, if this can hurt something as powerful as the Darkness, I wonder... what can it do to you?
>
> Crowley lifts his hand. It glows red. He throws a bolt of light towards Lucifer. Simmons throws herself in front of Lucifer, taking the full impact of the blast. She disappears into dust, while Lucifer is thrown hard into the brick wall. He collapses onto the floor.

> Crowley laughs as Lucifer struggles to get up. He tries to conjure the power from the Hand of God again, but nothing happens. Lucifer smiles and stands up. He puts his hand to the back of his head and shows blood to Crowley.
>
> Lucifer: You made me bleed my own blood. (He walks towards Crowley) You're out of juice, huh?
>
> Lucifer punches Crowley and he is flung behind a desk.
>
> Crowley: Bollocks.
>
> Lucifer looks behind the desk. Crowley is gone. Lucifer glares.

> Lucifer: Okay, guys. So, trying to smite the Darkness was a bust, huh? You had all of the power of heaven behind you. Couldn't even slow the bitch down. Well, no need to feel like abject losers. You learned a valuable lesson here. You need me. [He looks around, waiting for a response from any of the angels.] All right. Not giddy with awe.
>
> Angel #1: You... exploded Jofiel.
>
> Lucifer: Or did Jofiel explode himself? Just sayin'.
>
> Angel #2: God cast you out of heaven.
>
> Lucifer: And who do you think spread that tabloid headline? It was Captain G, the Eternal One. And why? (Lucifer puts his face close to Angel #2, intimidating him with gentle forehead bumps) Because I didn't buy in to His obsessive-compulsive love for mankind.
>
> Angel #1: Mankind is His creation.
>
> Lucifer: (getting up and walking around the room) Oh, come on! It's not like He invented the Prius, which actually works. I don't have to tell you people what a mess mankind is. The Salem Witch Trials... Third Reich... (He salutes and clicks his heels) ...Twin Towers. And, sure, every once in a while, He'll send down a little plague to straighten them out, but it's nothing permanent. Humanity brought us Hiroshima and got a redo. I merely questioned His priorities, and I got the boot.
>
> Angel #2: He said you're evil.
>
> Lucifer glares.
>
> Angel #1: ...incarnate. E-Evil incarnate.
>
> Lucifer: (smirking) It's marketing. He's creating a need in the consumer's mind. Can't be a Super Savior if you don't have a Super Villain.
>
> Angel #3: So, what are you offering?
>
> Lucifer: Well, a way out of this pickle.
>
> Angel #2: By "pickle," you mean the Darkness.
>
> Lucifer nods.
>
> Angel #3: You can reason with her?
>
> Lucifer: Well... I doubt that. But I can lock her away. This time for good. Done it before. Oh, Pops didn't tell you that, huh?
>
> Angel #1: Once you've... gotten rid of her, you'll want... to... stay around?
>
> Lucifer: Oh, I like the way you think. (He claps) Man, am I jazzed! Hey. If it makes you comfy, could call me God.

> Lucifer: Thank you. Hey, I like your spunk. There's always room for a go-getter in my organization.
>
> Lucifer grabs Angel #1 by the shoulder and drags him back. The angel is breathing heavily, slightly panicked.
>
> Lucifer: Hey, I know I can count on you. But what about your people? They on board, or we need to do a little wing-twisting?
>
> Angel #1: (nervously) I'll have to think about it.
>
> Lucifer: Don't you think about it too long. You know what they say... he who hesitates...(snaps his fingers) ...disintegrates.
>
> Lucifer: (to an angel) You look great. You been working out?

> In Heaven, the angels are panicking. They run back to the meeting room as the black cloud envelops them. Lucifer stands in the doorway, smiling. He puts an arm up to defend himself from the impact. The angels are thrown around the room, including Lucifer, but he just smiles, knowingly.
>
> In Heaven, the angels get to their feet, checking with each other to make sure they are all okay.
>
> Lucifer: Well, that... was a little payback, ladies and gents. I don't think Auntie Amara appreciated your little half-assed smiting. And, uh, guess what... this... this is just a teeny taste of what's to come. So, clearly my expertise is gonna come in handy. 'Cause God knows what's next. Ouch. I almost forgot. Um... God doesn't care.

> Dean: Hold on, okay? Let's just put it in reverse. We will put Lucifer back in the Cage after we put Amara back on ice. It has to happen in that order, otherwise there is no Lucifer, there's no Cage, there's no nothing.
>
> Crowley: He's spent years marinating in hate against us! He has to go.
>
> Sam: Problem is, we may need him.
>
> Dean: He's been down this road with Amara before. He might be the only one powerful enough to use the Horn against her.
>
> Crowley: He had me cleaning the floors with my tongue! He called me "puppy"! He made me beg!
>
> Dean: All right. Come on. Is this what this is about? Huh? Your stupid ego? The fact that he dissed you in front of a bunch of stupid demons? You're smarter than this. Come on!
>
> Sam: Dean's right. Priority is to put the Horn in Lucifer's hands and set him loose on Amara.
>
> Dean: <u>After we exorcise Lucifer out of Cass and put him into a new vessel.</u>
>
> Sam: What? Really?
>
> Dean: <u>Yes, really. We're not gonna send Lucifer into battle inside Cass. What if he doesn't make it?</u>
>
> Sam: Dean, it's a strong vessel. It's held Cass for years, and we know what he's been through. I'm guessing it can hold Lucifer.
>
> Dean: <u>"It"? It's not an "it," Sam. It's Cass.</u>
>
> Sam: And Cass wanted to do this.
>
> Dean: Yeah, well, there's times I want to get slapped during sex by a girl wearing a Zorro mask. That don't make it a good idea.
>
> Sam: Dean, this is exactly how we screw ourselves. W-We make the... the heart choice instead of the smart choice.
>
> Dean: Oh, okay. Thank you, Dr. Phil. <u>Cass is family.</u>
>
> Sam: Yes, and his choice deserves to be respected.
>
> Dean: Even if it kills him?
>
> Crowley: It's killing me. I would rather stick white-hot skewers in my eyes than listen to you two bitches bicker! I gave you the terms of my deal. If Lucifer's not back in the Cage, the Horn stays hidden.

> Dean cuts his hand and presses it against a spell etched on the wall. Lucifer starts to shake, as Castiel wakes inside him.
>
> Dean: <u>Cass! Castiel, show yourself!</u>
>
> Castiel: (breathing heavily) Dean?
>
> Dean: <u>Cass.</u>
>
> Castiel: What are you doing? What's... What's going on?
>
> Dean: <u>Cass, listen to me. We don't have a whole lot of time, okay? You have got to...</u>
>
> Castiel writhes and shakes, as Lucifer regains control.
>
> Dean: <u>Cass.</u>
>
> Lucifer continues to struggle, grunting and writhing.
>
> Dean: <u>Castiel, show yourself!</u>
>
> Lucifer: (laughing with glee) Oh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Uh, he's got to what? You boys... (laughing), ooh, you almost had me there for a minute, but these mail-order spells... they're just not what they're cracked up to be, are they?
>
> Dean: <u>Cass, expel him! You got to kick Lucifer out! Do you hear me?!</u>
>
> Lucifer: Honestly, I think he's happy with the arrangement. I mean, he did invite me in and all, Dean.
>
> Dean: <u>(yelling, desperate) Cass!</u>
>
> Lucifer: (mockingly) Cass!
>
> <u>Dean glares at Lucifer, in frustration and anger.</u>

> Crowley: Bloody hell.
>
> Crowley smokes out of his meat-suit and enters Lucifer. Sam, Dean and Rowena watch in astonishment. Crowley enters the mind of Castiel, who is <u>sitting in the bunker watching TV.</u>
>
> Crowley: Castiel?
>
> Castiel: <u>Oh, Crowley. What are you doing here?</u>
>
> Crowley: Is this the <u>Winchesters' kitchen</u>?
>
> Castiel: <u>Sort of. I come here in my mind to pass the time. For some reason, it has excellent reception.</u>
>
> Crowley: What's wrong with you? What has Lucifer done to you?
>
> Castiel: Well, he mostly just leaves me alone. I'm just waiting here, you know, for the battle with the Darkness.
>
> Crowley: He's really got his hooks in you. Snap out of it. Do you know what's happening out there? The Winchesters have trapped the abomination so that you can expel him so that they can put him back in the Cage...
>
> Castiel: Well, that doesn't sound like a very good idea.
>
> Crowley: In your current state, you're in no position to judge.
>
> Castiel: <u>Wait. That was Dean I saw a minute ago, wasn't it?</u>
>
> Crowley: Yes.
>
> Castiel: And he wants me to expel Lucifer?
>
> Crowley: Yes!
>
> Castiel: (laughing) Ha, ha, ha! Well... he may have a more objective view of the situation. Maybe I should.
>
> Crowley: So, let's do it now before it's too late.
>
> Lucifer: It already is. (He sighs) Really, Crowley? You want to put me back in the Cage? Well, I'm not going anywhere, and neither are you.

> Back in Castiel's mind, Lucifer tosses Crowley across the room.
>
> Lucifer: You second rate bean counter. (He picks Crowley up again and tosses him onto the table, <u>barely missing Castiel's TV</u>)
>
> Crowley: Aah!
>
> Castiel: <u>Guys, you're gonna break something.</u>

> Lucifer closes his fist and Sam and Dean begin to choke; they gasp and struggle for breath are he grips them tighter and tighter. Lucifer smirks. Rowena is still hiding, terrified. Suddenly there is an explosion and a gaping hole appears in the church. Lucifer turns to see Amara enter the room.
>
> Amara: Oh, Lucifer. <u>Dear nephew</u>, my, how you've changed. (Lucifer smirks) I was tracking her (she indicates Rowena) when she left my side.
>
> Lucifer: You were safely sealed away. You're gonna wish you'd stayed there.
>
> Lucifer holds up the Horn of Joshua and it glows red as he absorbs its power. His eyes turn white and he conjures a ball of fire into his hand. He aims it at Amara, throwing a beam of white light to engulf her. But then, as the light dies down, Amara remains standing, without a scratch. She lifts her hand and draws Lucifer effortlessly towards her. He drops the Horn of Joshua. Amara cups her hand on Lucifer's face, as Sam and Dean watch on in astonishment.
>
> Amara: I think you and I need to have a nice, long chat.
>
> Dean: <u>(yelling) Cass?</u>
>
> Amara turns to look at Dean. She raises her hand to release Dean and Sam from Lucifer's grip. Then there is a blinding flash of light, which envelops Amara and Lucifer. They have gone. Rowena makes her exit, while Sam and Dean look at each other in a combination of relief and disbelief.
