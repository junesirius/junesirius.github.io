> Crowley: Because Dean's sent me, Bullwinkle, the real Dean. I'll make this quick - you've been possessed by an angel. He's got you packed away in some dusty corner of your own mind, and I'm here to break you out.

<br><br>

> Crowley: Go. The back door. I'll handle this.

> Dean: Oh, 'cause you're such a good guy?
>
> Crowley: Right now, I'm the goodest guy you got.
>
> Dean: This don't make us square. I see you again -

> Crowley: <u>I'm dead. Yes, I know. I love you, too.</u>

> Dean: I said the next time I see you --
>
> Crowley: <u>Dead. Yes, rings a bell, but let's not dwell on the past, shall we?</u> This bar is a bust. That waitress is trouble with a capital VD, and your prey, Gadreel, has left the building. So, it's time to move on to more pressing matters, like destroying Abaddon.

> Scene changes to a close up of a PB&J sandwich. Castiel goes to take a bite as sits in the bunker. The door opens above him.
>
> Castiel: (clearly not enjoying the sandwich) Mm.
>
> Sam: (walking down the stairs) Hey.
>
> Castiel: <u>Tastes like...molecules.</u>
>
> Sam: What? What are you talking about?
>
> Castiel: When I was human, you know, I had to eat constantly. It was kind of annoying.
>
> Sam: Yeah, a lot of human things are pretty annoying.
>
> Castiel: <u>But...I enjoyed the taste of food -- particularly peanut butter with grape jelly, not jam. Jam I found unsettling.</u>
>
> Sam: (sitting on the table next to Castiel) So, what? Now you can't taste PB and J?
>
> Castiel: No, I-I taste every molecule.
>
> Sam: Not the sum of its parts, huh?
>
> Castiel: <u>It's overwhelming. It's disgusting. (looks longingly at the sandwich) I miss you, PB and J.</u>

> Castiel lays two fingers on Sam's forehead and starts to heal him. Suddenly he looks a little concerned.
>
> Sam: What?
>
> Castiel: (trying to cover it up) Nothing.
>
> Sam: (slaps his hand away) You're a terrible liar.
>
> Castiel: <u>That is not true. I once deceived and betrayed both you and your brother.</u>
>
> Sam: Okay, that's not the point.

> Crowley: (stammers and tries to make a sound)

> Scene switches to the Bunker. Sam and Castiel are walking down the stairs in the main room.
>
> Castiel: Sam, may I ask you a question?
>
> Sam: <u>(jokingly) You just did.</u>
>
> Castiel: Can I ask you another question?
>
> Sam: Well, technically, you -- yeah, go ahead. What's up?
>
> They stop in the doorway to the hall and face each other.
>
> Castiel: Sam, the trials. You chose not to go through with them for a reason, didn't you? You chose to live rather than to sacrifice yourself. You and Dean... <u>You chose each other.</u>
>
> Sam: (clearly not wanting to talk about it) Yeah, I did. We did. And then... Dean made a choice for me.

> Castiel: Sam? Sam?!
>
> Sam: (weakly) Keep going.
>
> Castiel: Why?
>
> Sam: We -- we -- we have to find Gadreel.
>
> Castiel: (starting to remove the needle from Sam's neck) <u>No. Why must the Winchesters run toward death?</u>
>
> Sam: (grasps the syringe in Castiel's hand and stops him from removing it) No, don't. Don't. Don't stop.
>
> Castiel: <u>Sam, when I was human, I died, and that showed me that life is precious, and it must be protected at all costs, even a life as... as pig-headed as a Winchester's.</u>
>
> Sam: <u>(voice heartbreaking soft) My life's not worth any more than anyone else's -- not yours or Dean's...or Kevin's. Please. Please, help me do one thing right.</u>
>
> Sam: Keep going.
>
> Castiel hesitants and then pushes the needle in further. Sam screams in pain.

> Castiel: Sam, I want Gadreel to pay as much as you do. <u>But nothing is worth losing you.</u> You know, being human, it didn't just change my view of food. It changed my view of you. I mean, I can relate now to how you feel.
>
> Sam: What are you talking about?
>
> Castiel: <u>The only person who has screwed things up more consistently than you...is me. And now I know what that guilt feels like. And I know what it... I know what it means to feel sorry, Sam. I am sorry.</u>
>
> Sam: I know.
>
> Castiel: You know, <u>old me -- I would've have just kept going. I would've jammed that needle in deeper until you died because the ends always justified the means.</u> But what I went though -- Well, that PB and J taught me that angels can change, so...who knows? Maybe Winchesters can, too.

> Scene opens with Sam and Castiel mixing the spell to track GADREEL. They add all the ingrediants and then finally add the angel grace. The mixture boils and then fades away. Castiel looks away, disappointed.
>
> Sam: Was that, uh... Was that it?
>
> Castiel: I'm afraid there wasn't enough Grace. We'll have to find Gadreel another way. I'm sorry, Sam.
>
> Sam: It's all right, Cass. You, uh... You were right. You were right about everything.
>
> <u>Sam suddenly leans over and hugs Castiel tightly. Castiel stand awkwardly without moving.</u>
>
> Sam: Now's the part where you hug back.
>
> Castiel: <u>(moving to hug Sam back) Oh. Right. Uh, sorry.</u>
>
> Sam: <u>(chuckling) Ah, there you go.</u>

> Bartholomew: I'm not asking you to. I will outrace Malachi in the hunt for Metatron, and I will certainly outrace you on your own. But if you can set aside your qualms about methods for one second, there's no reason the two of us can't take him down. Together.

> Bartholomew and Castiel sit in the waiting room talking.
>
> Bartholomew: Madness, wasn't it? A puny force of 20 behind enemy lines, launching an incursion against Raphael and his loyalists.
>
> Castiel: <u>It was a calculated risk.</u>
>
> Bartholomew: I thought you'd gone insane, and I questioned your leadership, second-guessed every step of the campaign. But you were my commander. I held my tongue. I followed orders. Raphael fled. Most of his loyalists, dead or captured. Your gambit paid off. You...Won.
>
> Castiel: <u>We won.</u>
>
> Bartholomew: <u>Word of your victory spread. You got called back to the garrison. You became the great Castiel...</u> While I stayed behind, just a grunt.
>
> Castiel: You gained a reputation for yourself, as well. The captives I left in your care, you tortured and killed them.
>
> Bartholomew: I was ordered to kill those captives. You've been flying solo for so long, you've forgotten that's what angels do. We follow orders.
>
> Castiel: Not you, though. Not anymore.
>
> Bartholomew: That's right. I give them.

> Bartholomew: Yes, I believe he is. (holds out the angel blade to Castiel) Now finish him off.
>
> Castiel: Bartholomew, it doesn't need to be like this.
>
> Bartholomew: Castiel, get your head out of the sand. Do you know why they brought you back from the battlefield? The truth?
>
> Castiel: Yes, I know the truth.
>
> Bartholomew: Our leaders wanted those captives killed, and they knew you'd stand in the way of their order. Said you didn't have it in you. That you couldn't do what needed to be done. But I know different. I know you've changed.
>
> Castiel: I'm not a murderer.
>
> Bartholomew: You weren't. Not then. But since then, you've slaughtered thousands of angels. You killed Malachi's man for his Grace.
>
> Castiel: <u>Who I was, what I did, that's not who I am.</u>
>
> Bartholomew: No? Then who are you? I want to work with you, Castiel, but I need proof. They need proof that they were wrong. That you can do what has to be done. This has to be done.
>
> Castiel: I was never free to leave. My only choice was to obey or be killed. Well, <u>I choose.</u>
>
> <u>Castiel hands the angel blade back to Bartholomew.</u>

> Bartholomew: As your refusal makes perfectly clear, you always thought you were better than me. Shall we put your superiority to the test once and for all?
>
> Bartholomew punches Castiel in the mouth twice.
>
> Castiel: No. <u>Angels fighting angels has to stop somewhere. Might as well stop with me.</u>
>
> Bartholomew: (picking up an angel blade) Fine.
>
> He lunges for Castiel but Castiel is able to grab his arm.
>
> Bartholomew: (as Angel #1 and #2 come to the rescue) Stand down! This is between me and the rebel.
>
> Castiel does a trick move and suddenly has Bartholomew in a headlock with his angel blade to his throat.
>
> Bartholomew: To the victor. Do it.
>
> Castiel: (letting him go) No.
>
> Bartholomew: What are you now? A penitent?
>
> Castiel: <u>I'm nothing.</u>
>
> Bartholomew: You never did understand, Castiel. There can be no peace without bloodshed.
>
> Bartholomew draws another angel blade and lunges for Castiel again. Castiel wrestles with him and finally stabs Bartholomew and kills him.
>
> Castiel: (turning to leave) <u>Let me pass.</u>
>
> Angel #1 and #2 let him leave.
