## Idea

**390.**【drowley/destiel】S08E23 Crowley "I deserve to be loved" + Dean "don't think deserve to be saved"

Crowley/Dean parallel

S08E23 Crowley "I deserve to be loved"

S04E01 Dean "What's the matter? You don't think you deserve to be saved"

(inspired by myself, about "deserve")

Dean & Cas both don't think they deserve to be saved/loved but are loved, but Crowley believe he deserve to be loved but is not loved (canonically)

what's affecting that train of thoughts/feeling of "deserve"? self-loathing/guilt makes them feel undeserved, demon doesn't feel guilty about his own doing so he thinks he deserve to be loved?

In order to figure out this love thing, Crowley & (demon!)Dean agree to try out for a while, try to feel and understand what love is, and then they really start feeling it, only to realize it's always there → (not happy ending?) then Dean is cured, only lingering thought about this time and relationship with Crowley, bury the feeling, insist it's because of demon blood or Crowley's trick/lure, it's not real, Crowley on the other hand knows his true feeling for Dean, makes S10 all the time very difficult for him to keep away, being scolded by Rowena that he's Dean's bitch; then S12 he sacrificed himself for Dean, thinking this time he finally can get some attention from Dean, and in this version Cas and Mary didn't die/lost, so Dean's emotion for Crowley is not covered under, he prayed to God to bring Crowley back but no chance, only then does he realize the emptiness, the loss, his feeling for Crowley was real. Whatever that is, it's there and it's real. So he mourns Crowley quietly, makes him a tombstone, carves him "The king that deserves to be loved."

**396.**【drowley】S10E01-03 summer love（R级？）

demon!Dean with Crowley, have messy fun together, take photo, wear cowboy hat, Crowley supplies demon for Dean to kill, Dean have a lot of sex with random humans, with Crowley too probably, ignore Sam/Cas's message, a lot of bad singing

Dean understands demon life more, understand Crowley more
