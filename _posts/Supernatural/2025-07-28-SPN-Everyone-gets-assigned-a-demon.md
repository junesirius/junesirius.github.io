Just realized it seems everyone of them seemed to have a demon on their tail, obsessed about them, can get enough of them, love them or love torturing them:

Mary has Azazel

John also has Azazel

Dean has Alastair

Sam has Ruby

Bobby has Crowley

Castiel has Meg

Gabriel has Asmodeus

<br>

Instead of everyone getting assigned a guardian angel, they each get assigned a demon instead.
