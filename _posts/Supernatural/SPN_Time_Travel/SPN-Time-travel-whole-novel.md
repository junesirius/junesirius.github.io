## Draft

### Initial thoughts

S07E21/23 失控的Cas在害怕崩溃中时间穿越

谁知道一只崩溃失控的天使会做什么？也许会毁灭世界，也许会杀光所有恶魔甚至人类，也许会害怕得逃走，逃到时间流里，穿越到了不知道什么时代，Dean和Sam又怎么样才能重新找到他？只靠Meg坐在病床旁边看杂志又能起到什么效果？

想看崩溃的Cas突然穿越到了各种历史事件中，比如走在维多利亚时代的街道上平复心情，然后被那时代的人用奇怪的眼神打量。也许会遇到其他穿越时间的旅行者，也许又会遇到吸血鬼（《发现女巫》第二季），也许为了逃脱那些更大的conflict终于又重新跑回原本的时间线了，发现Dean和Sam都着急得不得了。也可以很容易地跟DW crossover了，Meg的last name又正好是Masters，好像非常方便用来制造矛盾误解让博士也惊慌一下了。

（适合用第三人OC视角讲故事

《White Butterfly》（标题含义：蝴蝶效应+白色纯洁疯卡，白色病服）

在quarrel之后飞走到过去时间线，然后不是飞回来的，而是take the long way，慢慢等着时间流逝然后才回到现实时间线，几千几万年的时间对天使来说都不是什么太长的时间。第一次在game room，其实不是他直接飞到了同时间线的game room，而是飞回去了好几个小时，一个人在那里玩游戏自娱自乐，知道丁他们那个时候不会出现，所以他是安全的。等他们来的时候他已经一个人安静了很久，自我疏解好了。第二次倒回去更久，以此类推

他想要帮忙，想要让世界变得更好，所以他倒回去改变历史：中世纪女巫审判，庞贝，智人尼安德特人，陨石撞地球恐龙灭绝，第一条上岸的鱼，地球的诞生

一不小心或者故意干扰了太多的时间线，每一次改变都会让现实时间线的他们见证蝴蝶效应后果，参考泰坦尼克集，reality break apart，代价是卡要被reality的paradox裂缝吞噬掉，碎裂在时间线里。他像个犯错的小孩子一样回到现实时间线了，丁温求他带着自己重溯路线，重置他做的改变，被迫把他原本救下的人又重新像原本一样死去了，一起全部重新经历一遍，丁从卡视角看到了broader world view，看人类进化和地球诞生，看卡非人的一面和人类的一面，敬畏又心疼

### Organized thoughts

to make contrast with the ending, the beginning emphasize on: Cas unwilling to help leviathan problem, Cas super broken, Dean super impatient

When Cas was broken, every time he ran away from a quarrel, like the first time in hospital, Dean worry he can be in any time anywhere, Meg says he's just in the day room. And we assumed he's just fly there, a displacement, not a temporal flight, but we are wrong, everyone's wrong. He flies to the past, and he's not flying back, he takes the long way, wait out for the time to pass slowly, until it come back to the current timeline, and meet Dean in the day room in the now time. He can be there for hours or even weeks already. He's an angel, <u>hundreds of thousands of years is a blink</u>. He plays games with himself, he calms himself down, ~~because he was trying to forget the reminded trauma about conflict (don't touch it)~~, knows he's safe because Dean wasn't there then, <u>so he won't be disturbed no matter what</u>, the perfect place (and time) to hide to. (slips how long he's been there, that's how Dean know)

That's how he calm himself back down, piece himself back together. He would have needed way longer to piece himself together, not just a night (8pm in the night, Meg called them in the morning), <u>he has spent way longer, but that time was folded</u>, he spent them in the past, saved them so much more time, so the current him that they meet is already a sane enough version, walking and talking, mostly functional, the best he can manage for himself to be presentable. <u>Even if broken, he wants them to meet the best version of him, he doesn't want them disappointed at him.</u>

Every time there is a quarrel and he flies back, he flies back further and waits out longer. The first few times are still the recent times when they are around him, hours, then years, then decades, centuries, millenniums, he goes back to history, then pre-history. He wants to help, to make the world a better place, to fix things from the root cause, since the very first time things went wrong, so he traces back time to change history:

medieval, salem witch trial, save the poor women (but run into real witches) ← in passing line? was to meet a witch promised to give him peace but burned shortly, Salem Village (now Danvers), 1692 summer, two hundred people (fly away because of the violence & conflict)

Pompeii, stop the volcano, same the twenty thousand people, consequence? history of Italy changed, culture development unbalanced? ← in passing line? "I was in here and here and here", one of time/place: Mount Vesuvius, 79 AD eruption day ("the word 'volcano' wasn't invented until that day")

the very early human evolution, the homo sapiens vs Neanderthals', enjoy the company with the very first few humans, relationship with Adam etc.? (natural science history vs religious history, how to merge?) ← accidentally affect human evolution, modern human has different features (write in a way that modern people don't realize weird things are weird because it changes the whole history, butterfly effect)

falling meteorite, dinosaur extinction, comment: "just like Sodom and Gomorrah", "I wasn't there" (because he actually was, suddenly remember?) ← real dinosaurs have furs

watch the fish, the first fish on the shore (S06E20 I remember being at a shoreline, watching a little grey fish heave itself up on the beach and an older brother saying, "don't step on that fish, Castiel. Big plans for that fish."), the first creature on the land ← help it? touch it? affect its evolution?

the formation of Earth, solar system, galaxy ← watch the space quietly, help create the stars, maybe this is when the asteroid belt was formed, should have been a star there, Cas break one when he's there this time, so now throughout the whole history, that planet doesn't exist (give that star a name and some feature? Diana (Artemis), from Roman history like the rest, or gods name from star name bc stars come first)

Every time he's at some place/time, Cas accidentally or intentionally interfere the timeline, every time after the change, the people in current timeline experience the consequence immediately and take it for granted, they don't remember what's the old normal (≈ S06E17 Titanic episode, DW S5 finale), only Cas know he messed up and need help, every time he try to fix by himself by going back further and mess up worse, so have to go to Dean

when after shattering the star and made the asteroid belt, Cas is properly frightened. Sky fall apart, reality break apart by too many changes from butterfly effect, cost is mass energy compensate, paradox create crack in the reality and going to swallow Cas (or just bc Cas can't bear the mess he made to the world, self-torture even as the broken!Cas's child mind, still not worry about himself, it's about world). Cas go back to current time to Dean, Dean ask him to trace his own steps back with him, reset his changes, unsave the people he save, witness and experience everything together with him. Dean finally get to see the whole human and universe history together with Cas, in Cas's eyes, see a broader world view, how many human get to see human evolution and Earth's creation. Dean float in the space watching Earth forming for the first time, air and sea start to divide and shape, he's not looking at the universe, he's looking at Cas (≈ Good Omens S2, DW S01E02), realize more than ever how unhuman and human Cas is, in awe and feel pain. They fix timeline and go home together.

go back to the original timeline, still need to fix leviathan problem (can't fix it in the past bc Cas unleash them himself, fixed point, paradox), after all that, Cas willing to help, Dean willing to be patient enough to him, Cas's brokenness is fixed (go back to fit into S07E23 before finale)

### Outline

(Note 1: the chapters where Cas went away, can still write in Dean's POV or 3rd POV)

(Note 2: doesn't need to be in the same order as the organized timeline idea, could rewind and skip, especially the time jump events, bc Dean'll revisit with him, so doesn't have to write twice, can go through Dean POV, only detail them on 2nd trip)
