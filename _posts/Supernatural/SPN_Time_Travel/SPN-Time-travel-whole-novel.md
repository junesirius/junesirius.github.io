## Draft

### Initial thoughts

S07E21-23 失控的Cas在害怕崩溃中时间穿越

谁知道一只崩溃失控的天使会做什么？也许会毁灭世界，也许会杀光所有恶魔甚至人类，也许会害怕得逃走，逃到时间流里，穿越到了不知道什么时代，Dean和Sam又怎么样才能重新找到他？只靠Meg坐在病床旁边看杂志又能起到什么效果？

想看崩溃的Cas突然穿越到了各种历史事件中，比如走在维多利亚时代的街道上平复心情，然后被那时代的人用奇怪的眼神打量。也许会遇到其他穿越时间的旅行者，也许又会遇到吸血鬼（《发现女巫》第二季），也许为了逃脱那些更大的conflict终于又重新跑回原本的时间线了，发现Dean和Sam都着急得不得了。也可以很容易地跟DW crossover了，Meg的last name又正好是Masters，好像非常方便用来制造矛盾误解让博士也惊慌一下了。

（适合用第三人OC视角讲故事

《White Butterfly》（标题含义：蝴蝶效应+白色纯洁疯卡，白色病服+prefer insects to angels, so prefer butterfly than angel）

在quarrel之后飞走到过去时间线，然后不是飞回来的，而是take the long way，慢慢等着时间流逝然后才回到现实时间线，几千几万年的时间对天使来说都不是什么太长的时间。第一次在game room，其实不是他直接飞到了同时间线的game room，而是飞回去了好几个小时，一个人在那里玩游戏自娱自乐，知道丁他们那个时候不会出现，所以他是安全的。等他们来的时候他已经一个人安静了很久，自我疏解好了。第二次倒回去更久，以此类推

他想要帮忙，想要让世界变得更好，所以他倒回去改变历史：中世纪女巫审判，庞贝，智人尼安德特人，陨石撞地球恐龙灭绝，第一条上岸的鱼，地球的诞生

一不小心或者故意干扰了太多的时间线，每一次改变都会让现实时间线的他们见证蝴蝶效应后果，参考泰坦尼克集，reality break apart，代价是卡要被reality的paradox裂缝吞噬掉，碎裂在时间线里。他像个犯错的小孩子一样回到现实时间线了，丁温求他带着自己重溯路线，重置他做的改变，被迫把他原本救下的人又重新像原本一样死去了，一起全部重新经历一遍，丁从卡视角看到了broader world view，看人类进化和地球诞生，看卡非人的一面和人类的一面，敬畏又心疼

### Organized thoughts

to make contrast with the ending, the beginning emphasize on: Cas unwilling to help leviathan problem, Cas super broken, Dean super impatient

When Cas was broken, every time he ran away from a quarrel, like the first time in hospital, Dean worry he can be in any time anywhere, Meg says he's just in the day room. And we assumed he's just fly there, a displacement, not a temporal flight, but we are wrong, everyone's wrong. He flies to the past, and he's not flying back, he takes the long way, wait out for the time to pass slowly, until it come back to the current timeline, and meet Dean in the day room in the now time. He can be there for hours or even weeks already. He's an angel, <u>hundreds of thousands of years is a blink</u>. He plays games with himself, he calms himself down, ~~because he was trying to forget the reminded trauma about conflict (don't touch it)~~, knows he's safe because Dean wasn't there then, <u>so he won't be disturbed no matter what</u>, the perfect place (and time) to hide to. (slips how long he's been there, that's how Dean know)

That's how he calm himself back down, piece himself back together. He would have needed way longer to piece himself together, not just a night (8pm in the night, Meg called them in the morning), <u>he has spent way longer, but that time was folded</u>, he spent them in the past, saved them so much more time, so the current him that they meet is already a sane enough version, walking and talking, mostly functional, the best he can manage for himself to be presentable. <u>Even if broken, he wants them to meet the best version of him, he doesn't want them disappointed at him.</u>

Every time there is a quarrel and he flies back, he flies back further and waits out longer. The first few times are still the recent times when they are around him, hours, then years, then decades, centuries, millenniums, he goes back to history, then pre-history. He wants to help, to make the world a better place, to fix things from the root cause, since the very first time things went wrong, so he traces back time to change history:

- medieval, witch trial, save a poor women (but actually real witch) ← was to meet a witch promised to give him peace but persecuted shortly, Canisbay Scotland, 1668 summer with a 7y old boy, turn out to be Rowena&Fergus MacLeod, peasant, daughter of tanner (fly away because of the violence & conflict)
- Pompeii, stop the volcano, same the twenty thousand people, consequence? history of Italy changed, culture development unbalanced? ← (short, in passing line) "I was in here and here and here", one of time/place: Mount Vesuvius, 79 AD eruption day Aug 24 ("the word 'volcano' wasn't invented until that day")(year of "Consulhood of Vespasian and Titus")(Caecilius, Metella, Evelina, Quintus)
- the very early human evolution, the homo sapiens vs Neanderthals', enjoy the company with the very first few humans, relationship with Adam etc.? <u>watching bees nude</u> (natural science history vs religious history, how to merge?) ← accidentally affect human evolution, modern human has different features (write in a way that modern people don't realize weird things are weird because it changes the whole history, butterfly effect)
- falling asteroid, dinosaur extinction, comment: "just like Sodom and Gomorrah", "I wasn't there" (because he actually was, suddenly remember?) ← real dinosaurs have furs
- watch the fish, the first fish on the shore (S06E20 I remember being at a shoreline, watching a little grey fish heave itself up on the beach and an older brother saying, "don't step on that fish, Castiel. Big plans for that fish."), the first creature on the land ← help it? touch it? affect its evolution?
- the formation of Earth, solar system, galaxy ← watch the space quietly, help create the stars, maybe this is when the asteroid belt was formed, should have been a star there, Cas break one when he's there this time, so now throughout the whole history, that planet doesn't exist (give that star a name and some feature? Diana (Artemis), from Roman history like the rest, or gods name from star name bc stars come first)

Every time he's at some place/time, Cas accidentally or intentionally interfere the timeline, every time after the change, the people in current timeline experience the consequence immediately and take it for granted, they don't remember what's the old normal (≈ S06E17 Titanic episode, DW S5 finale), only Cas know he messed up and need help, every time he try to fix by himself by going back further and mess up worse, so have to go to Dean

when after shattering the star and made the asteroid belt, Cas is properly frightened. Sky fall apart, reality break apart by too many changes from butterfly effect, cost is mass energy compensate, paradox create crack in the reality and going to swallow Cas (or just bc Cas can't bear the mess he made to the world, self-torture even as the broken!Cas's child mind, still not worry about himself, it's about world). Cas go back to current time to Dean, Dean ask him to trace his own steps back with him, reset his changes, unsave the people he save, witness and experience everything together with him. Dean finally get to see the whole human and universe history together with Cas, in Cas's eyes, see a broader world view, how many human get to see human evolution and Earth's creation. Dean float in the space watching Earth forming for the first time, air and sea start to divide and shape, he's not looking at the universe, he's looking at Cas (≈ Good Omens S2, DW S01E02), realize more than ever how unhuman and human Cas is, in awe and feel pain. They fix timeline and go home together.

go back to the original timeline, still need to fix leviathan problem (can't fix it in the past bc Cas unleash them himself, fixed point, paradox), after all that, Cas willing to help, Dean willing to be patient enough to him, Cas's brokenness is fixed (go back to fit into S07E23 before finale)

### Outline

**<u>Timeline:</u>** this is what happened when Cas disappeared between S07E21-23, what he did during "What are you gonna do?" "I don't know. Isn't that amazing?" (May 4-18, 2012)

Start with "I heard a ping that pierced me" (only angel can hear it), Cas POV, from S07E21: crazy!Cas wake up, broken, mind wanders about everything in the universe, insects, small things; enter Dean, canon quarrel of asking for help but Cas run away, Dean chase him into day room, Cas slip "been here for weeks" "what do you mean for weeks, I just saw you two minutes ago" "that's three weeks ago for me. It's quiet here, it's nice."

(Dean POV) bring Cas home (Rufus's shelter), empathize on: Cas unwilling to help leviathan problem, Cas super broken, Dean super impatient & pissed. After a big quarrel ("You don't get to have a cat, no one cares you're broken, it's your mess, you clean it up" S07E23 or similar), Cas is gone again. Cas very quickly reappear and disappear, drop a red-haired woman with a 7y-old boy at doorstep, who slips names they're Rowena & Fergus MacLeod.

(Rowena POV) talking about how's Cas like when they meet in Scotland, 1668, how messed up she is and how kind but broken Cas is; some news about something witchy and weird in Scotland (Rowena b. 1640, Fergus b. 1661)

(Dean POV) Cas comes and goes without seeing Dean again and drop a family from a small town in Italy, meanwhile newspaper about something mundane in Pompeii (saying in a way like it's normal), MET museum see something weird about volcano exhibition. The dropped family are Caecilius's family

(Caecilius POV) telling them about Pompeii life, 79 AD (year of "Consulhood of Vespasian and Titus") Aug 24 (eruption day), the Cas from his POV, different from Dean's POV, Dean sidetracked from leviathan problem, prioritizing Cas → boys begin to have a guess what's Cas doing, Dean pray to Cas come back before messing up more things

(Dean POV) Cas show up in his car, nude, covered in bees, talking about homo sapiens & Neanderthals, early humans, Dean try to be nice, insist on him to stay, Cas afraid of him → something seriously wrong, Dean and all humans have six fingers and don't think it's weird → Cas freak out, reminded of *Titanic* time, insist on fixing it himself, fly away again

(Dean POV) quick forward, butterfly effect consequences almost simultaneously: news about dinosaur escape from local zoo, other humanoid species fighting against leviathans (fishperson, birdperson, etc.), asteroid rain toward Earth, extra star in orbit, immediate end of world threat

Cas show up, frustrated, scared, lost, don't know what to do, every time fly back mess up more things; Dean volunteer to trace back with him, put everything back together, bringing those people back (not easy, morally difficult)

(Dean POV) trace back: take Rowena back to Scotland (1y later still deserted Fergus, etc., nothing changed), witness witch trial, normal human cruelty; take Caecilius back to Pompeii, witness eruption, can't save everyone; homo sapiens vs Neanderthals, what does "human" mean; asteroid & dinosaur extinction, can't save every life, normal nature cruelty & nature rule; the first fish, normal nature kindness & what does "life" mean; formation of Earth, watch star together, the beginning of the world → Cas doesn't want to break the star, but has to, what does "choice" mean, they make the asteroid belt together, basically affect the universe, Dean realize the broader view, not limited ever again

go back to original timeline (May 18, 2012), still need to fix leviathan problem (mention why can't fix from changing past timeline), after all that, Cas willing to help, still slightly broken but a lot more mature and pull himself together (less child-like), Dean willing to be patient enough, ready to pull the big fight on leviathan and save the world together again. they have just seen the beginning of all the time and universe, what can they possibly be scared of.

"All the creation accompanies death, all the extinction accompanies new life. That's the natural order. You can't save every single human being, you can't save all living life, you can't save a star." "But at least we can try. And we will." That's what Dean's made of. That's what Cas loves him for. That's the story of them.

(Note 1: the chapters where Cas went away, write in Dean's POV or 3rd POV)

(Note 2: doesn't need to be in the same order as the organized timeline idea, could rewind and skip, especially the time jump events, bc Dean'll revisit with him, so doesn't have to write twice, can go through Dean POV, only detail them on 2nd trip)

### Claim info

#### Claim summary

"What are you gonna do?"

"I don't know. Isn't that amazing?"

When Cas is broken (crazy!Cas time, end of S7), every time he runs away from a quarrel, like the times in the hospital or in the shelter when Dean gets so angry at him and he flies away, and everyone thinks he just flies into a different *place* at the same *time*, but they're wrong. Cas goes back in time, he flies to the past where no one can find him, and Dean was not there, so he gets to wait out for the time to pass slowly, where he would be alone and quiet and feel safe, until the current time catches up again and Dean finds him again. Like the time in the hospital, when Dean finds him in the day room, and thinks they just part for two minutes, but actually Cas has been sitting there for days, simmering in the solitary, playing games with himself, calming himself down.

And every time the quarrel gets more fierce, he needs longer to calm down. He flies farther and farther back into the past, where he can spend hundreds of thousands of years on his own without disturbance, piecing himself back together. Dean thinks he wakes up the night before they meet again, but actually Cas has been in the past for ages, that's why he said "it took everything to get me here." Which literally means eons of time.

And then there's a big quarrel between them again, when Dean tells him "You don't get a damned cat," Cas flies away again. This time, he flies too far and can't sit outside of the history he's in. And every time he touches the history, he messes something up accidentally, so he tries to fix it by tracing farther back, and making things worse, in a loop. He goes back to medieval time during witch trial, Pompeii during eruption day, the very early human evolution time when he supports Neanderthals more than the homo sapiens, the day the asteroid falls onto the Earth and dinosaurs extinct, the day the first fish moves onto the land, the day the Earth takes the shape, and the asteroid belt in solar system is still a star. Every little change has a butterfly effect, and when he tries to save the lives during his visit, Cas screws up the timeline. He has to turn to Dean for help again, and Dean traces back in time with him, seeing all the big moments of human evolution and world formation, what does it even mean to be a human, or to be a world, or the nature rule and choices. Dean gets to see things in a much broader view than any human ever can, only an angel like Cas can, Dean finally starts getting to understand Cas.

They fix things together, undo the changes Cas did, unsave the people and creature and lives Cas tried to save, unmake the star Cas tried to make. And during the process, Cas's brokenness is gradually healed, they get to understand each other, Dean starts to learn to be patient and not always so angry. Then they go back to their old current timeline, the year 2012, go back dealing with leviathan problem, and Cas is willing to help them out. And with all they learned, they know the rules and they're not afraid of anything anymore. They have just seen the beginning of all the time and universe, what can they possibly be scared of.

#### Visual description

Dean and Cas floating in the space, watching the galaxy, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is still a star -- the star that's never been there, the star they have to break so human history can be preserved and all that any human being can remember are its pieces scattering in the space.

Or any other moment during the timeline traceback journey: Dean and Cas in Pompeii, watching the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius; or Dean and Cas in Jurassic time, watching asteroids hitting the Earth and dinosaurs extinct; or they watch the first grey fish climbing to the land, or they hang out with the very primal human species Neanderthals, dancing around a campfire, etc.

(Personally love the first one most, or could maybe find a way to combine multiple visual elements together)

### Post info

#### Post summary

"What are you gonna do?"

"I don't know. Isn't that amazing?"

<br>

When Cas can go to all the time and all the place, where did he go?

He goes to see a creature he hasn't seen in millenniums, a fish that is essential, and a star that is just forming. He watches them with the joy from a child's eyes, and he can't help reaching his hands to them. That is when everything -- the history, the reality -- starts crashing down.

### Chap. 1 Two Minutes

> (Cas POV, starting from S07E21)
>
> Start with "I heard a ping that pierced me" (only angel can hear it): crazy!Cas wake up, broken, mind wanders about everything in the universe, insects, small things; enter Dean, canon quarrel of asking for help but Cas run away, Dean chase him into day room, Cas slip "been here for weeks" "what do you mean for weeks, I just saw you two minutes ago" "that's three weeks ago for me. It's quiet here, it's nice."

When he wakes up, it is dark outside.

It is at night, and he is on the planet Earth. Lying on a soft surface.

Castiel does not open his eyes for a few minutes. Letting the surrounding settling down on him slowly, like nights falling on the Earth.

He does not need to open his eyes to see.

The air smells sharp with disinfectant and cleaning odors, with a touch of fragrance. The chemicals floating in the air along with dust and pollens.

The window has a slit opening, the night breeze fluttering inside like the breath of a ghost.

Castiel sits up slowly.

"What is that sound?" He asks the air. The voice comes out of his throat forms a human language. He remembers he's in a vessel.

"The thunder, you mean?" A female answers him, from a chair sitting left of his bed.

The figure sits on that chair is a shape of shadow, residing inside another vessel. A demon, he recognizes. Then he remembers her name.

Castiel does not notice the thunder until this moment. The thunder and lightning outside the window is quite noticeable, now that he turns to the window. He does not know why he doesn't notice them earlier. There might be a rain coming down. The air smells fresh dirt -- petrichor.

"No, a bright 'ping,' like a lovely Christmas bell. It wakes me up." Castiel tells the demon with a smile. "You can't hear it, because you're not an angel."

Meg looks him up and down with cautious eyes, "Welcome back, Clarence."

Castiel examines his own hands, like they are something he's never seen before. "I haven't been to anywhere," he answers, then thinks for a moment, "but you're right, there are so many places I can go."

Meg frowns at him, "What do you mean? Where do you want to go?"

"Somewhere in the universe," Castiel tells her, considering, voice soft, "some time."

"Great, good as nothing." Meg puts down the magazine in her hands, turning on the bedside lamp, studying him closely. "Something different about you," she denotes, "how you feel? Everything alright? I need to make a phone call."

Castiel smiles wilder. "I've never been better," he announces, then holds out a finger, "Pull my finger."

Meg looks at his eyes, then his index finger, as if it's a bomb she needs to defuse. "What?"

"My finger," Castiel nods encouragingly, "pull it."

Meg touches his fingertip tentatively.

The bulb in the lamp explodes, shattering glass flying in all directions.

Castiel chuckles in the darkness. "Isn't it fun?" He says cheerfully.

Meg stares at him. "What the fuck, something is definitely wrong with you."

She fuddles to replace the bulb. The new light is bright orange, the color of sunset.

The corner of Castiel's lip drops slightly at the comment. "You cursed," he blinks.

Meg looks at him unbelievably, "Damn right I did, news flash, I'm a demon, I curse." She raises her voice, "What's your problem?"

Castiel gets off the bed hurriedly, then takes a step away from her, "Please don't be angry. I don't want to fight."

He disappears with the sound of wings flapping.

"What the hell?" Meg stares at the empty room.

Meg finds him in the dayroom down the hall, two minutes later.

Castiel is in the middle of a chess game with himself, half the chess pieces from either sides taken from the board.

"What was that?" Meg approaches the two angels suspiciously. Neither of them look up from the game. One of them wears his iconic trench coat, the other in white hospital gown, ruffled from sleeping in.

Meg knows Castiel's trench coat still hangs on the foot of his bed.

"Do you know there is a game in 19th century, so famous that it's called 'Immortal Game.'" The Castiel in trench coat says, moving a bishop on the board.

"But the game isn't really immortal," the Castiel sitting opposite to him moves a knight in defense.

"No, I mean, WHAT?" Meg walks up to the table, staring at both of them. "Who are you?" Her fingers fumble to her back, clutching on a hidden angel blade.

"I'm Castiel." The angel in trench coat tells her plainly.

"And I'm Castiel." The other one says the same, with a warm smile, as if playing chess with oneself is the most normal thing in his life.

"Uh-hum." Meg doesn't loosen her angel blade, unconvinced.

"It's nice to be somewhere quiet," the trench coat Castiel says, dropping his eyes, "especially when Dean is angry."

Meg scrutinizes him carefully, and she points out the obvious, slowly, "Dean is not here."

The trench coat Cas tells her, "He is -- or, he will be." He checks the clock on the dayroom wall. "In about twenty-four hours."

<br>

### Chap. 2 Three Weeks

> (Dean POV)
>
> crazy!Cas wake up, broken, mind wanders about everything in the universe, insects, small things; enter Dean, canon quarrel of asking for help but Cas run away, Dean chase him into day room, Cas slip "been here for weeks" "what do you mean for weeks, I just saw you two minutes ago" "that's three weeks ago for me. It's quiet here, it's nice."
>
> bring Cas home (Rufus's shelter), empathize on: Cas unwilling to help leviathan problem, Cas super broken, Dean super impatient & pissed. After a big quarrel ("You don't get to have a cat, no one cares you're broken, it's your mess, you clean it up" S07E23 or similar), Cas is gone again. Cas very quickly reappear and disappear, drop a red-haired woman with a 7y-old boy at doorstep, who slips names they're Rowena & Fergus MacLeod.

(**Warning words before chapter:** canon-typical anger control issue, Dean isn't very friendly or patient with Cas, some part can be upsetting, heavy angst)

<br>

Dean lingers in the Impala a while too long before Sam urges him.

The hospital looks as shabby as when they left, with a broken angel inside.

Sam eyes his reluctant figure, "You ready?"

Dean swallows, shaking his head. "We raced all the way here and now I don't know."

He chews on the bitter taste of his own words, remembering how Sam looked like when Cas took over all the ugly and nasty hell leftovers, and the frightening look in the angel's eyes when he glanced up at them the moment those venom sank in. And that was before he went into comatose.

Dean's never going to be ready.

He walks into the angel's room with a pounding heart.

The room is dark, with only a dim light on the ceiling. Glass residues glitter on the floor.

Cas is in his old trench coat, standing straight, staring out of the window. Impala parks not far from that window.

"Hey, Cas." Dean breathes out his name, barely more than a whisper. He feels like wiping his eyes.

Cas turns to him, with a gentle smile. Not counting the hospital gown, he looks all good and familiar. Warm and peaceful. Happy, even.

"Outside today, in the garden, I followed a honeybee." he tells them, looking into Dean's eyes. Then starts talking about flowers and honey, and cat's tongue.

His voice is eager and cheerful, lost the low gravel tone he carried with for years. Almost like Jimmy's when Cas wasn't in him.

Dean studies the lines on his face, the smile on his cheeks, the crinkles at the corner of his eyes.

Those look all wrong. He looks all wrong.

Dean hates himself for thinking that, but the Cas standing before him, is not the Cas he knew -- not entirely, anyway. Almost like meeting the Cas in the Croatoan world, the one that was so broken and human. And here he is, once again.

Dean stares at him so hard as if trying to see through him, looking inside, pealing off the exterior joyful smiling Cas that isn't making any sense, finding the real him hidden somewhere inside. He can't find it. And he doesn't know what to do.

He sees broken glasses on the floor. He only sees things that are broken.

But they have bigger things to worry about. They have a whole world crawling with monsters to save. Dean looks back in Cas's eyes, thinking, *They don't have time to take things slowly. They just don't have time.*

He hates himself for the thought anyway.

He doesn't even ask Cas how bad it is.

"Buck up, buddy, we need your help," Dean pleads silently.

Cas glances him quickly, "I don't involve in violence anymore. Please understand."

Dean stuffs the tablet they found into Cas's hands. "Can you read it?"

Cas squints at the tablet like reading through old man's reading glasses, holding the tablet closer then farther, tilting his head this way and that. "'Tree'?"

He looks up at them like a child looking for praise of recognizing a new word. Dean just frowns at him.

Cas turns back to the tablet. "'Horse'? 'Fiddler crab'? I don't know, I can't read it. It wasn't meant for angels."

"Then what are you doing? Playing word puzzle? Bullshitting craps?" Dean's patience is running thin. "We're running out of time here, Cas!"

Cas flinches, shoving the tablet back into Dean's hands, taking a step away from him, his head bowed low, eyes on the floor. "Please, there is no need for anger here, Dean."

Dean takes a step closer to him, narrowing their distance, standing in his personal space, "Oh, really? Because I shouldn't be pissed that the world is ending, *again*? That there are monsters everywhere and this is all *your fault*? But then you just fucking died and got amnesia and then gone all wild, leaving *me* cleaning up your mess? Tell you what, Cas, why don't you go ahead clean up your own mess this time. Actually go save something, because I am so tired --"

"Dean..." Sam calls out behind him, in his usual peacemaker's tone. Dean ignores him.

Cas just stares at him three inches away with widened panicked eyes, like a cornered little creature. Wordless.

"You got anything to say about that?" Dean pushes down the bitter taste bubbling in his throat, doesn't give in.

Cas opens his mouth, but no sound comes out of it. He flashes him another alarmed look, then there is the sound of wings. The air stirs, and the angel is gone.

"Friggin' angels!" Dean doesn't hide his frustration, throwing his hands in the air, "He's like a child! Running away like that, where the hell did he go?"

"Dean, he can be anywhere." Sam says in a worried voice. "For all we know, he can be in any *time*."

Meg sighs, "He's down in the dayroom now. I guarantee it. And Dean? Try not to startle him, will ya?"

Dean shoots her a glare, "I'm not dead enough to let a demon tell me how to handle an angel."

He moves down the hallway.

<br>

The dayroom is at the end of the hall, far away from all the other patient rooms. It has all the usual hospital look, white blue wallpaper with uglyass letters wishing you a good health, plastic chairs around small square tables. The air smells disgustingly fresh with too much artificial fragrance to cover the possibly never-ending, distinctive stale smell of death and sickness.

Cas sits straight at the chair at the far end of the room, near a window. His back to the door.

Dean takes a deep breath walking toward him.

There is a stack of board game boxes piling on the edge of the table. Cas sits with two hands under his chin, deep in thought.

"Hey," Dean regards him for a second, aiming for a softer voice. But even he knows the echo of his yell is still lingering in the air. He can even hear them himself.

"Hello, Dean." Cas comes out of his meditation, looking almost cheerful to see him, as if he has forgotten everything harsh he just said. Is the angel extra forgiven these days or does he have a goldfish's memory now?

Dean swallows.

"Didn't mean to yell at you earlier," Dean mumbles quickly. He's not gonna apologize.

Cas just nods briefly.

"It's forgotten," he says gently, "It's been a while anyway."

"A while?" Dean frowns, "It's like two minutes ago."

"It's been weeks for me." Cas answers.

Slow understanding pieces the information back together.

"You flied back in time." Dean says with realization, "How long you've been sitting here?"

"About three weeks, I think." Cas thinks about it. "I went to play a chess with myself, and other games. I knew all the move I did, but it's still fun. It's quiet here, just me and myself."

Dean stares at him unbelievably, "Did you just fly back in time 'cause you know I wasn't there, so you wouldn't have to see me?"

Cas blinks rushedly, then, quietly, "No."

Dean sighs, "Can you stop being a child?" Cas tilts his head, Dean adds, "Please?"

Cas looks down at the center of the table.

"What I said just now -- weeks ago, whatever -- my points stand." Dean stares him down. "We could really use your help to take down the Leviathans."

"I don't fight anymore." Cas answers quietly, insistent, "I watch bees."

"God damn it, Cas, not a good time for retiring!" Dean is on the edge of snapping, "Do you remember what you did?"

Cas turns away, reaching out for a board game box, showing the title side to him. The box reads, "Sorry!"

Dean closes his eyes, taking a deep breath. He takes the game box away from Cas, setting it back on the table side, on top of a chess board.

"You don't get to say 'Sorry' after you slaughter countless people," he says in a cold voice, "You button up your coat and make amends. You try your best undo the damage, even if it costs you everything, at least you'd know you tried your best fixing it, not just hiding behind playing shitty games." He fixes Cas with a stare, "'Cause that's what a coward do. Tell me you're better than that."

Cas swallows, shifting his eyes onto the game box stack again. And he says, "Would you like a different game?"

<br>

Dean wants to scream, he wants to bang his head on the wall until one of them cracks. He doesn't care which. As long as something to do, something to take them out of this stalemate silence.

They have come back to the shelter -- Rufus's cabin in Montana, the closest place they get to lay low and maybe call a base camp ever since Bobby's place got burned down. The broken angel is in the kitchen, washing plates. They get jack squat on how to end Dick and his monster army or save the world. And the clock is ticking.

The restlessness in the room is suffocating.

How can Cas still work on things as mundane as "washing dishes"? Like he's totally a human in a totally normal world, like they're just camping out in a cabin for fun?

Dean stares at his hunched back. Cas is wiping his hand on a washing cloth. *Unbelievable.*

Sam is rummaging through the books god knows however many times as if answers can just pop out of there by themselves from the texts they've read for tons of times already. Meg is... doing whatever demons do, Dean doesn't keep a tab.

Cas turns back from the kitchen sink, hands still drying a plate. "Do we need a cat?" he asks, eyes wide and innocent, "Doesn't this place feel one species short? Probably why it's so quiet all the time."

Anger swells in Dean's chests like a balloon.

"Would a cat help us kill Dick and save the world?" Dean hears himself asking. He feels a disapproval glare from Sam's direction, maybe Meg's too, he disregards them.

Cas turns back to the sink, putting the clean plate down. "No," he mutters.

"Then why the hell do we care?" Dean stands up, walking in Cas's direction. Sam hesitates a step toward him, looks unsure of whether to stop him.

"I..." Cas throws a quick flustered look at his approaching figure, "I just thought..."

"You just thought what, Cas? That we can pretend nothing bad is happening, the world is not ending? That as long as you keep making us burgers and washing plates, everything will just be fine, we can just be a happy normal family forever?" Dean feels blood pumping into his head, the veins at his temples thudding with his words. There might be blood in his eyes too because the world looks extra red and burning to him. "Just tell me, what are you thinking, by not doing anything? Are things just gonna fix themselves? Or are you thinking we'll just magic things up at the last minute, like we always do? 'Cause you know what, I run out of ideas, we might as well just all sit around and wait for the world to end while watching some fucking TVs!"

Dean can't help himself, his fingers itching at punching something. He marches to the kitchen sink, Cas ducks to the corner of the room. Dean grabs the damned plate in the sink, throwing it at the wall with all his force. "TELL ME!"

The ceramic plate shatters to pieces with a loud clash.

Cas disappears with a fluttering sound of the wings.

Dean glances around, not seeing him. "Typical." He mumbles, feeling even shittier than before.

<br>

(**Words after the chapter**: Please hang in there with me, I hate writing angry Dean but it's sort of just necessary for the story's purpose, really need a conflict situation to make Cas fly away. Things will get better shortly, promise.)

#### draft notes

to make contrast with the ending, the beginning emphasize on: <u>Cas unwilling to help leviathan problem, Cas super broken, Dean super impatient</u>

When Cas was broken, every time he ran away from a quarrel, like the first time in hospital, Dean worry he can be in any time anywhere, Meg says he's just in the day room. And we assumed he's just fly there, a displacement, not a temporal flight, but we are wrong, everyone's wrong. He flies to the past, and he's not flying back, he takes the long way, wait out for the time to pass slowly, until it come back to the current timeline, and meet Dean in the day room in the now time. He can be there for hours or even weeks already. He's an angel, <u>hundreds of thousands of years is a blink</u>. He plays games with himself, he calms himself down, ~~because he was trying to forget the reminded trauma about conflict (don't touch it)~~, knows he's safe because Dean wasn't there then, <u>so he won't be disturbed no matter what</u>, the perfect place (and time) to hide to. (slips how long he's been there, that's how Dean know)

That's how he calm himself back down, piece himself back together. He would have needed way longer to piece himself together, not just a night (8pm in the night, Meg called them in the morning), <u>he has spent way longer, but that time was folded</u>, he spent them in the past, saved them so much more time, so the current him that they meet is already a sane enough version, walking and talking, mostly functional, the best he can manage for himself to be presentable. <u>Even if broken, he wants them to meet the best version of him, he doesn't want them disappointed at him.</u>

Every time there is a quarrel and he flies back, he flies back further and waits out longer. The first few times are still the recent times when they are around him, hours, then years, then decades, centuries, millenniums, he goes back to history, then pre-history. He wants to help, to make the world a better place, to fix things from the root cause, since the very first time things went wrong, so he traces back time to change history

### Chap. 3 The Red-Haired Woman

> (Rowena POV) talking about how's Cas like when they meet in Scotland, 1668, how messed up she is and how kind but broken Cas is; some news about something witchy and weird in Scotland (Rowena b. 1640, Fergus Roderick MacLeod b. 1661)

Dean does not expect to hear that sound of feathery wings again so soon. Some loose pages on the table fly to the floor.

He turns to look for Cas.

But there is no familiar color of the tan trench coat, except, right to his face, is a burning red color of a woman's long curly hair, holding the hand of an auburn-haired little boy. Looks like no more than ten years old.

He stares eyes to eyes with the woman for a moment, before snapping, "Who the hell are you?"

Glancing at the cabin's warding and not seeing any damage to them, he adds, "And how the hell did you get here?"

The thin young woman looks like shocked out of her mind, shivering like a leaf in winter. She answers with a really high-pitched voice and an authentic Scottish accent: "Where the bloody hell am I? And who the hell are *you*?!"

<br>

Ten minutes later, Sam manages to conjure up an old blanket from some corner and a glass of water.

Dean sits by the table -- the books are moved to the floor now, the table serving its real purpose for the moment -- watching the red-haired woman sipping the water.

"Now, talk." Dean tries very hard to not snap, but the days are wearing out his temper rapidly.

The woman shoots him a glare, frowning at the glass, "You don't have any whiskey or anything strong? What is this, not even tea? What are you, English?"

Dean rolls his eyes, "Americans!"

"That explains it," the woman twitches her lips, drinks some more water, and pushes the glass to the little boy. The boy grabs the glass with two chubby little hands.

"Why don't you start with a name?" Dean tries.

"Didn't you mom tell you never to give out your names or you will burn?" the woman mocks.

"New rule in America, what about staying all Riddler and you get shot?" Dean doesn't so much as to reach for his gun, merely glancing at the weapon stock hanging on the wall, figuring that should make the point clear enough.

"Dean!" Sam warns him, sitting down at the other side of the table, reaching out a hand to the red-haired woman, "Sorry about my brother's manner, we've been through a lot. So you've met my brother, Dean, and I'm Sam."

The red-haired woman shakes his hand, "Pleasure," she amuses, giving him a once-over with a tight smirk, "I like you more than your brother. You can call me 'Red' if you want, some villagers do that."

Dean exchanges a look with Sam meaning "That's obviously not her real name" and "Who wouldn't give their names? Bad guys", and Sam returns with a light shrug, meaning "I don't care, this is good enough. Go easy on her, Dean" and "Not everyone is a bad guy".

Dean turns his attention back to the red-haired woman. "Alright, *Red*," he presses on the name as if this can push her telling something she's been holding her tongue so tight about, "Why don't you share your side of the story, and we can decide what to do from there?"

The woman starts: "It is the year 1668 to me. Canisbay, Scotland is just on the edge of a sweet wee summer time..."

<br>
<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">
<br>

It is the year 1668. Canisbay, Scotland is just on the edge of a sweet wee summer time.

That strange young man came into the village three days ago. The villagers didn't like him much, because he was just too strange -- even for us. He didn't talk much, he didn't walk around, he didn't eat or drink.

He just stood in the moor, watching the sheep and cattle. Some people thought he was up to no good and wanted to steal their beloved sheep and cattle.

I wasn't paying him much attention either, in the beginning.

I was frustrated, and thinking about some probably really bad ideas -- if you must know, I was thinking about how to revenge that heartless man and his rich wife.

When I was deep in thought, the little brat ran along again, like he always did, when I was doing my things. I probably should keep him chained like a dog just to be safe.

Anyway, he ran away, directly into the farm land where he really shouldn't go in. Cattles are like giant beasts to him, and he could so easily just get treaded like a shepherd's pie.

I was already thinking where to bury this little thing, when that man appeared before me, my boy in his arms. That was the first time I really look at him, and he had such blue eyes.

He said I should take better care of my boy, and I said thank you. My little thing said he ran there because he saw a pretty little flower, and this strange man just walked over to the flock, picked that most normal yellow whin from the moor and walked back. I had to invite him to tea after that.

"I'm here for the whins, too." he said when he sat down in my little hut. My boy was playing with the yellow flower, trying to eat it.

I was asking where he came from.

"Far away," that's what he said. He looked at me in a way even I felt bad for him. Those blue eyes, I think they were talking, more than he actually spoke. I asked him if he traveled a lot.

"Quite a lot lately, yes." he said with a smile. Such a gentle bright smile.

"You must miss home then, mister." I said.

"Castiel," he said, the smile turned a teeny little sad, but believe my eyes, I could tell. And then he said -- but I was sure that wasn't meant for me, he said, "Miss it, yes, but I don't think I'm welcomed here anymore."

"You're welcome to stay here, if it doesn't bore you." I told him. My humble little living place was just a barn no one wanted or looked. The village had a chapel and really not much going on -- not the best tourist spot.

"It's a lovely place," he said. His voice was so... in awe, I'm sure no one in history said that about Canisbay like he did ever before, not even the one built it.

"It has the most beautiful whins of all places, and this is the best summer of all the time." he said.

I had to admit I would never know what's the difference of those teeny tiny flowers had this year or last, but apparently someone has been keeping records for them.

"And the bees too." he added, then carried on talking about sheep and cattle and pasture, but that's when I started getting bored and stopped listening.

"As much as I'd love to be your company, mister," I told him, "I had work to do."

I didn't really have a "work" to do, but I consider my planning for the future an important task. And of course, I didn't want him stay long enough to notice my cauldron or grimoire.

He apologized and left.

At the sunset that day, when I walked past that field, he was still standing there, facing the west. The sheep and cattle had gone, I think he was just watching the color of the sun on the grass then.

I saw him again the next day but we didn't talk.

And the third day -- third time is the charm, isn't it -- I walked past him as I was tied backhanded, the villagers were cheering and waving torches.

Did I forget to mention, witch hunting was a really popular sport in the village? They just love to tie you up and roast you, and I guess this is just my day. Fergus cried so loud, but I asked him to shut up. This day would be the day that the world saw me as who I am, and for once, the villagers would be right on their judgement.

I don't blame them. They were quite right the cauldron wasn't for cooking soup for my boy's cold or the grimoire for just learning how to read.

The stake they tied me to was quite high and hot, and I was thinking should have wore the other black dress -- I wouldn't mind that one burnt, but this one, I liked this red one.

Then the fire started. The smoke was the first bothering thing. I couldn't breathe, let alone saying any spell. I was very busy cursing all of them. Fergus cried so loudly.

And then I saw that strange young man in the trench coat again -- Castiel stood in the crowd, far away at the edge, looking at me with his big sad eyes. I think those blue eyes lighted up somehow.

The next thing I know, I'm here, standing in the room, surrounded by two men interrogating me just like those bloody peasants.

It would be nice if mister Castiel could just explain what he'd done. If it was wizardry, it was far more powerful than I had ever known, and I'd really like to learn from the best.

<br>
<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">
<br>

The woman licks her lips as she finishes. "Well?" She raises her eyebrows, "Are we done with the story-telling time?"

Dean swallows, looking down at the table.

Sam asks, "The kid, did you say his name is Fergus?"

"Aye," the red-haired woman replies easily.

Dean stiffens, "Please tell me the last name is not MacLeod."

"How do you know?" the woman eyes both of them carefully, pulling the boy closer to her, "Meet Fergus Roderick MacLeod."

"Hello," the boy waves at them shily.

"How old is he?"

"Seven after this fall."

"And you are?" Dean asks with a tight voice.

"Rowena MacLeod, at your service." The woman finally tells them.

Sam springs to his feet, gesturing to Dean, "Can I talk to you for a sec?" Right when Dean is also jumping to his feet.

"Yeah, just about to say the same."

<br>

"What the hell?"

"I know, right?"

"That's Crowley."

"When he's barely seven."

"What do we do about them?"

"Isn't that like the world's ultimate moral question: Can you kill baby Hitler when he was an infant if you can time travel?"

"Why would Cas even bring them here?"

"I don't know, maybe he's trying to help, like I asked him to, you know? Maybe he thought if we could figure out about them, we could change things."

"Or maybe he was just there watching the flowers and so happened ran into a witch hunt, and he was just trying to save some poor woman and her young kid, who turned out happened to be the future King of Hell."

"Yeah, or maybe that. And also, don't forget, the woman turned out to be a real witch."

"Where is he now?"

"How would I know?"

"Did you try to pray to him?"

"Dude, I'm probably the last person he wants to see now. He dropped them by without showing up a feather. Didn't you listen, she said he said he didn't think he'd be welcome here, and that's all on me."

"Then tell him he's wrong, and you're sorry."

Dean stares at Sam intensely, who stares him back with equal intensity.

Dean averts the look, checking back on the witch and the kid human Crowley. "But what do we do with them now?"

They are standing at the corner of the room, farthest to the table, but who knows if witch has the super ear, they lower their voice to barely a whisper for the heated discussion.

Sam follows his eyes, sighing. "I don't know. Feed them, I guess? Be good and kind to them so Crowley wouldn't turn out to be such a big dick?"

"You want to freaking raise the King of Hell?" Dean almost forgets to keep his voice low. Sam shushes him eagerly. "What, so that we can see the world change or his memory change in twenty years? Face the reality, Sam, we might not live another month with everything out there!"

"Or maybe ask for her help? A witch in our team gotta be better than nothing. Maybe there's a spell Cas knew that she knew and we could use."

Dean thinks about that. "Alright, you do that, talking to her, fathering the kid, I'll try Cas."

"Sounds like a plan." Sam nods.

### Chap. 4 The Man From Roman

> (Dean POV) Cas comes and goes without seeing Dean again and drop a family from a small town in Italy, meanwhile newspaper about something mundane in Pompeii (saying in a way like it's normal), MET museum see something weird about volcano exhibition. The dropped family are Caecilius's family
>
> (Caecilius POV) telling them about Pompeii life, 79 AD (year of "Consulhood of Vespasian and Titus") Aug 24 (eruption day), the Cas from his POV, different from Dean's POV, Dean sidetracked from leviathan problem, prioritizing Cas → boys begin to have a guess what's Cas doing, Dean pray to Cas come back before messing up more things

The plan is interrupted by the explosion of incoming phone calls and messages.

"Have you checked the news?" Garth's voice comes through first.



###### [TBA: increasing witch activity worldwide starting from Scotland, immediately lead to next guest, Cas still doesn't show his face]

<br>

**Words after chapter:** inspired by Doctor Who S04E02 *The Fires of Pompeii*.

#### draft notes

Pompeii, stop the volcano, same the twenty thousand people, consequence? history of Italy changed, culture development unbalanced? ← (short, in passing line) "I was in here and here and here", one of time/place: Mount Vesuvius, 79 AD eruption day Aug 24 ("the word 'volcano' wasn't invented until that day")(year of "Consulhood of Vespasian and Titus")

characters: Caecilius (banker, marble trader), Metella, Evelina, Quintus

### Chap. 5 Bees and Butterflies

> (Dean POV) Cas show up in his car, naked, covered in bees, talking about homo sapien sapiens & Neanderthals, early humans, Dean try to be nice, insist on him to stay, Cas afraid of him → something seriously wrong, humans split in two tribes and in forever war, Dean biologically look different and sound differently → Cas freak out, reminded of *Titanic* time, insist on fixing it himself, fly away again
>
> (Dean POV) quick forward, butterfly effect consequences almost simultaneously: news about dinosaur escape from local zoo, other humanoid species fighting against leviathans (fishperson, birdperson, etc.), asteroid rain toward Earth, extra star in orbit, immediate end of world threat
>
> Cas show up, frustrated, scared, lost, don't know what to do, every time fly back mess up more things; Dean volunteer to trace back with him, put everything back together, bringing those people back (not easy, morally difficult)

#### draft notes

very time he's at some place/time, Cas accidentally or intentionally interfere the timeline, every time after the change, the people in current timeline experience the consequence immediately and take it for granted, they don't remember what's the old normal (≈ S06E17 Titanic episode, DW S5 finale), only Cas know he messed up and need help, every time he try to fix by himself by going back further and mess up worse, so have to go to Dean

when after shattering the star and made the asteroid belt, Cas is properly frightened. Sky fall apart, reality break apart by too many changes from butterfly effect, cost is mass energy compensate, paradox create crack in the reality and going to swallow Cas (or just bc Cas can't bear the mess he made to the world, self-torture even as the broken!Cas's child mind, still not worry about himself, it's about world). Cas go back to current time to Dean, Dean ask him to trace his own steps back with him, reset his changes, unsave the people he save, witness and experience everything together with him.

### Chap. 6 Scotland, 1668 (300 years ago)

> (Dean POV) trace back: take Rowena back to Scotland (1y later still deserted Fergus, etc., nothing changed), witness witch trial, normal human cruelty

#### draft notes

medieval, witch trial, save a poor women (but actually real witch) ← was to meet a witch promised to give him peace but persecuted shortly, Canisbay Scotland, 1668 summer with a 7y old boy, turn out to be Rowena&Fergus MacLeod, peasant, daughter of tanner (fly away because of the violence & conflict)

Rowena: self-loathing, newly deserted by the rich man going back to his rich wife, feel weak, "if I don't hate you, I would love you", not cruel yet but angry, hatred of the world bc cruelty, b. 1640, now 28y, Fergus 7y; Cas ≈ Oskar to her for now, be kind to her, but can't change anything fundamentally

consequence if not fix: witch running around in Scotland, cursing people through all history

### Chap. 7 Pompeii, 79 AD (2,000 years ago)

> (Dean POV) trace back: take Caecilius back to Pompeii, witness eruption, can't save everyone

#### draft notes

Pompeii, stop the volcano, same the twenty thousand people, consequence? history of Italy changed, culture development unbalanced? ← (short, in passing line) "I was in here and here and here", one of time/place: Mount Vesuvius, 79 AD eruption day Aug 24 ("the word 'volcano' wasn't invented until that day")(year of "Consulhood of Vespasian and Titus")

characters: Caecilius (banker, marble trader), Metella, Evelina, Quintus

Consequence if not fix: Pompeii still exists, just a normal, kinetic, lively town in Italy, but too many people → social, cultural problem? social instability?

### Chap. 8 Europe, Ice Age (40,000 years ago)

> (Dean POV) trace back: homo sapiens vs Neanderthals, what does "human" mean

#### draft notes

the very early human evolution, the homo sapiens vs Neanderthals', enjoy the company with the very first few humans, relationship with Adam etc.? <u>watching bees nude</u> (natural science history vs religious history, how to merge?) ← accidentally affect human evolution, modern human has different features (write in a way that modern people don't realize weird things are weird because it changes the whole history, butterfly effect)

Consequence if not fix: both human species coexist and forever at war, Dean biologically look/sound differently

**Words after chapter:** inspired by *Everything Everywhere All at Once*

### Chap. 9 Earth, Jurassic Epoch (66 million years ago)

> (Dean POV) trace back: asteroid & dinosaur extinction, can't save every life, normal nature cruelty & nature rule

#### draft notes

falling asteroid, dinosaur extinction, comment: "just like Sodom and Gomorrah", "I wasn't there" (because he actually was, suddenly remember?) ← real dinosaurs have furs

Consequence if not fix: dinosaur coexist with human

### Chap. 10 Sea, Age of Fishes (357 million years ago)

> (Dean POV) trace back: the first fish, normal nature kindness & what does "life" mean

#### draft notes

watch the fish, the first fish on the shore (S06E20 I remember being at a shoreline, watching a little grey fish heave itself up on the beach and an older brother saying, "don't step on that fish, Castiel. Big plans for that fish."), the first creature on the land ← help it? touch it? affect its evolution?

Consequence if not fix: other humanoid species existing along with normal human beings (e.g. fish-people, bird-people, lizard-people)

### Chap. 11 Space, Hadean Eon (4.6 billion years ago)

> (Dean POV) trace back: formation of Earth, watch star together, the beginning of the world → Cas doesn't want to break the star, but has to, what does "choice" mean, they make the asteroid belt together, basically affect the universe, Dean realize the broader view, not limited ever again

#### draft notes

the formation of Earth, solar system, galaxy ← watch the space quietly, help create the stars, maybe this is when the asteroid belt was formed, should have been a star there, Cas break one when he's there this time, so now throughout the whole history, that planet doesn't exist (give that star a name and some feature? Diana (Artemis), from Roman history like the rest, or gods name from star name bc stars come first)

Consequence if not fix: gravity and orbit of Earth is changed, unstable environment for human living, human extinction/not evolved like this in the first place; new asteroid rain toward Earth bc no protection from asteroid belt, immediate end of world (=Earth) threat

Dean finally get to see the whole human and universe history together with Cas, in Cas's eyes, see a broader world view, how many human get to see human evolution and Earth's creation. Dean float in the space watching Earth forming for the first time, air and sea start to divide and shape, he's not looking at the universe, he's looking at Cas (≈ Good Omens S2, DW S01E02), realize more than ever how unhuman and human Cas is, in awe and feel pain. They fix timeline and go home together.

### Chap. 12 Whitefish Montana, 2012 (now)

> (Dean POV) go back to original timeline (May 18, 2012), still need to fix leviathan problem (mention why can't fix from changing past timeline), after all that, Cas willing to help, still slightly broken but a lot more mature and pull himself together (less child-like), Dean willing to be patient enough, ready to pull the big fight on leviathan and save the world together again. they have just see the beginning the time and universe, what else can they be scared of

#### draft notes

go back to the original timeline, still need to fix leviathan problem (can't fix it in the past bc Cas unleash them himself, fixed point, paradox), after all that, Cas willing to help, Dean willing to be patient enough to him, Cas's brokenness is fixed (go back to fit into S07E23 before finale)

"All the creation accompanies death, all the extinction accompanies new life. That's the natural order. You can't save every single human being, you can't save all living life, you can't save a star." "But at least we can try. And we will." That's what Dean's made of. That's what Cas loves him for. That's the story of them.

match back to the beginning angst:

When Cas was broken, every time he ran away from a quarrel, like the first time in hospital, Dean worry he can be in any time anywhere, Meg says he's just in the day room. And we assumed he's just fly there, a displacement, not a temporal flight, but we are wrong, everyone's wrong. He flies to the past, and he's not flying back, he takes the long way, wait out for the time to pass slowly, until it come back to the current timeline, and meet Dean in the day room in the now time. He can be there for hours or even weeks already. He's an angel, <u>hundreds of thousands of years is a blink</u>. He plays games with himself, he calms himself down, ~~because he was trying to forget the reminded trauma about conflict (don't touch it)~~, knows he's safe because Dean wasn't there then, <u>so he won't be disturbed no matter what</u>, the perfect place (and time) to hide to. (slips how long he's been there, that's how Dean know)

That's how he calm himself back down, piece himself back together. He would have needed way longer to piece himself together, not just a night (8pm in the night, Meg called them in the morning), <u>he has spent way longer, but that time was folded</u>, he spent them in the past, saved them so much more time, so the current him that they meet is already a sane enough version, walking and talking, mostly functional, the best he can manage for himself to be presentable. <u>Even if broken, he wants them to meet the best version of him, he doesn't want them disappointed at him.</u>

Every time there is a quarrel and he flies back, he flies back further and waits out longer. The first few times are still the recent times when they are around him, hours, then years, then decades, centuries, millenniums, he goes back to history, then pre-history. He wants to help, to make the world a better place, to fix things from the root cause, since the very first time things went wrong, so he traces back time to change history
