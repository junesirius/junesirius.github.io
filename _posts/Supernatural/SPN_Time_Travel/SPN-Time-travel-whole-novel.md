## Draft

### Initial thoughts

S07E21-23 失控的Cas在害怕崩溃中时间穿越

谁知道一只崩溃失控的天使会做什么？也许会毁灭世界，也许会杀光所有恶魔甚至人类，也许会害怕得逃走，逃到时间流里，穿越到了不知道什么时代，Dean和Sam又怎么样才能重新找到他？只靠Meg坐在病床旁边看杂志又能起到什么效果？

想看崩溃的Cas突然穿越到了各种历史事件中，比如走在维多利亚时代的街道上平复心情，然后被那时代的人用奇怪的眼神打量。也许会遇到其他穿越时间的旅行者，也许又会遇到吸血鬼（《发现女巫》第二季），也许为了逃脱那些更大的conflict终于又重新跑回原本的时间线了，发现Dean和Sam都着急得不得了。也可以很容易地跟DW crossover了，Meg的last name又正好是Masters，好像非常方便用来制造矛盾误解让博士也惊慌一下了。

（适合用第三人OC视角讲故事

《White Butterfly》（标题含义：蝴蝶效应+白色纯洁疯卡，白色病服+prefer insects to angels, so prefer butterfly than angel）

在quarrel之后飞走到过去时间线，然后不是飞回来的，而是take the long way，慢慢等着时间流逝然后才回到现实时间线，几千几万年的时间对天使来说都不是什么太长的时间。第一次在game room，其实不是他直接飞到了同时间线的game room，而是飞回去了好几个小时，一个人在那里玩游戏自娱自乐，知道丁他们那个时候不会出现，所以他是安全的。等他们来的时候他已经一个人安静了很久，自我疏解好了。第二次倒回去更久，以此类推

他想要帮忙，想要让世界变得更好，所以他倒回去改变历史：中世纪女巫审判，庞贝，智人尼安德特人，陨石撞地球恐龙灭绝，第一条上岸的鱼，地球的诞生

一不小心或者故意干扰了太多的时间线，每一次改变都会让现实时间线的他们见证蝴蝶效应后果，参考泰坦尼克集，reality break apart，代价是卡要被reality的paradox裂缝吞噬掉，碎裂在时间线里。他像个犯错的小孩子一样回到现实时间线了，丁温求他带着自己重溯路线，重置他做的改变，被迫把他原本救下的人又重新像原本一样死去了，一起全部重新经历一遍，丁从卡视角看到了broader world view，看人类进化和地球诞生，看卡非人的一面和人类的一面，敬畏又心疼

### Organized thoughts

to make contrast with the ending, the beginning emphasize on: Cas unwilling to help leviathan problem, Cas super broken, Dean super impatient

When Cas was broken, every time he ran away from a quarrel, like the first time in hospital, Dean worry he can be in any time anywhere, Meg says he's just in the dayroom. And we assumed he's just fly there, a displacement, not a temporal flight, but we are wrong, everyone's wrong. He flies to the past, and he's not flying back, he takes the long way, wait out for the time to pass slowly, until it come back to the current timeline, and meet Dean in the dayroom in the now time. He can be there for hours or even weeks already. He's an angel, <u>hundreds of thousands of years is a blink</u>. He plays games with himself, he calms himself down, ~~because he was trying to forget the reminded trauma about conflict (don't touch it)~~, knows he's safe because Dean wasn't there then, <u>so he won't be disturbed no matter what</u>, the perfect place (and time) to hide to. (slips how long he's been there, that's how Dean know)

That's how he calm himself back down, piece himself back together. He would have needed way longer to piece himself together, not just a night (8pm in the night, Meg called them in the morning), <u>he has spent way longer, but that time was folded</u>, he spent them in the past, saved them so much more time, so the current him that they meet is already a sane enough version, walking and talking, mostly functional, the best he can manage for himself to be presentable. <u>Even if broken, he wants them to meet the best version of him, he doesn't want them disappointed at him.</u>

Every time there is a quarrel and he flies back, he flies back further and waits out longer. The first few times are still the recent times when they are around him, hours, then years, then decades, centuries, millenniums, he goes back to history, then pre-history. He wants to help, to make the world a better place, to fix things from the root cause, since the very first time things went wrong, so he traces back time to change history:

- medieval, witch trial, save a poor women (but actually real witch) ← was to meet a witch promised to give him peace but persecuted shortly, Canisbay Scotland, 1668 summer with a 7y old boy, turn out to be Rowena&Fergus MacLeod, peasant, daughter of tanner (fly away because of the violence & conflict)
- Pompeii, stop the volcano, same the twenty thousand people, consequence? history of Italy changed, culture development unbalanced? ← (short, in passing line) "I was in here and here and here", one of time/place: Mount Vesuvius, 79 AD eruption day Aug 24 ("the word 'volcano' wasn't invented until that day")(year of "Consulhood of Vespasian and Titus")(Caecilius, Metella, Evelina, Quintus)
- the very early human evolution, the homo sapiens sapiens vs Neanderthals', enjoy the company with the very first few humans, ~~relationship with Adam etc.?~~ <u>watching bees nude</u> (natural science history vs religious history, how to merge? Adam is the fish, for fun/joke) ← accidentally affect human evolution, modern human has different features (write in a way that modern people don't realize weird things are weird because it changes the whole history, butterfly effect)
- falling asteroid, dinosaur extinction, comment: "just like Sodom and Gomorrah", "I wasn't there" (because he actually was, suddenly remember?) ← real dinosaurs have furs
- watch the fish, the first fish on the shore (S06E20 I remember being at a shoreline, watching a little grey fish heave itself up on the beach and an older brother saying, "don't step on that fish, Castiel. Big plans for that fish."), the first creature on the land ← help it? touch it? affect its evolution?
- the formation of Earth, solar system, galaxy ← watch the space quietly, help create the stars, maybe this is when the asteroid belt was formed, should have been a star there, Cas break one when he's there this time, so now throughout the whole history, that planet doesn't exist (give that star a name and some feature? Diana (Artemis), from Roman history like the rest, or gods name from star name bc stars come first)

Every time he's at some place/time, Cas accidentally or intentionally interfere the timeline, every time after the change, the people in current timeline experience the consequence immediately and take it for granted, they don't remember what's the old normal (≈ S06E17 Titanic episode, DW S5 finale), only Cas know he messed up and need help, every time he try to fix by himself by going back further and mess up worse, so have to go to Dean

when after shattering the star and made the asteroid belt, Cas is properly frightened. Sky fall apart, reality break apart by too many changes from butterfly effect, cost is mass energy compensate, paradox create crack in the reality and going to swallow Cas (or just bc Cas can't bear the mess he made to the world, self-torture even as the broken!Cas's child mind, still not worry about himself, it's about world). Cas go back to current time to Dean, Dean ask him to trace his own steps back with him, reset his changes, unsave the people he save, witness and experience everything together with him. Dean finally get to see the whole human and universe history together with Cas, in Cas's eyes, see a broader world view, how many human get to see human evolution and Earth's creation. Dean float in the space watching Earth forming for the first time, air and sea start to divide and shape, he's not looking at the universe, he's looking at Cas (≈ Good Omens S2, DW S01E02), realize more than ever how unhuman and human Cas is, in awe and feel pain. They fix timeline and go home together.

go back to the original timeline, still need to fix leviathan problem (can't fix it in the past bc Cas unleash them himself, fixed point, paradox), after all that, Cas willing to help, Dean willing to be patient enough to him, Cas's brokenness is fixed (go back to fit into S07E23 before finale)

### Outline

**<u>Timeline:</u>** this is what happened when Cas disappeared between S07E21-23, what he did during "What are you gonna do?" "I don't know. Isn't that amazing?" (May 4-18, 2012)

Start with "I heard a ping that pierced me" (only angel can hear it), Cas POV, from S07E21: crazy!Cas wake up, broken, mind wanders about everything in the universe, insects, small things; enter Dean, canon quarrel of asking for help but Cas run away, Dean chase him into dayroom, Cas slip "been here for weeks" "what do you mean for weeks, I just saw you two minutes ago" "that's three weeks ago for me. It's quiet here, it's nice."

(Dean POV) bring Cas home (Rufus's shelter), empathize on: Cas unwilling to help leviathan problem, Cas super broken, Dean super impatient & pissed. After a big quarrel ("You don't get to have a cat, no one cares you're broken, it's your mess, you clean it up" S07E23 or similar), Cas is gone again. Cas very quickly reappear and disappear, drop a red-haired woman with a 7y-old boy at doorstep, who slips names they're Rowena & Fergus MacLeod.

(Rowena POV) talking about how's Cas like when they meet in Scotland, 1668, how messed up she is and how kind but broken Cas is; some news about something witchy and weird in Scotland (Rowena b. 1640, Fergus b. 1661)

(Dean POV) Cas comes and goes without seeing Dean again and drop a family from a small town in Italy, meanwhile newspaper about something mundane in Pompeii (saying in a way like it's normal), MET museum see something weird about volcano exhibition. The dropped family are Caecilius's family

(Caecilius POV) telling them about Pompeii life, 79 AD (year of "Consulhood of Vespasian and Titus") Aug 24 (eruption day), the Cas from his POV, different from Dean's POV, Dean sidetracked from leviathan problem, prioritizing Cas → boys begin to have a guess what's Cas doing, Dean pray to Cas come back before messing up more things

(Dean POV) Cas show up in his car, nude, covered in bees, talking about homo sapiens & Neanderthals, early humans, Dean try to be nice, insist on him to stay, Cas afraid of him → something seriously wrong, Dean and all humans have six fingers and don't think it's weird → Cas freak out, reminded of *Titanic* time, insist on fixing it himself, fly away again

(Dean POV) quick forward, butterfly effect consequences almost simultaneously: news about dinosaur escape from local zoo, other humanoid species fighting against leviathans (fishperson, birdperson, etc.), asteroid rain toward Earth, extra star in orbit, immediate end of world threat

Cas show up, frustrated, scared, lost, don't know what to do, every time fly back mess up more things; Dean volunteer to trace back with him, put everything back together, bringing those people back (not easy, morally difficult)

(Dean POV) trace back: take Rowena back to Scotland (1y later still deserted Fergus, etc., nothing changed), witness witch trial, normal human cruelty; take Caecilius back to Pompeii, witness eruption, can't save everyone; homo sapiens vs Neanderthals, what does "human" mean; asteroid & dinosaur extinction, can't save every life, normal nature cruelty & nature rule; the first fish, normal nature kindness & what does "life" mean; formation of Earth, watch star together, the beginning of the world → Cas doesn't want to break the star, but has to, what does "choice" mean, they make the asteroid belt together, basically affect the universe, Dean realize the broader view, not limited ever again

go back to original timeline (May 18, 2012), still need to fix leviathan problem (mention why can't fix from changing past timeline), after all that, Cas willing to help, still slightly broken but a lot more mature and pull himself together (less child-like), Dean willing to be patient enough, ready to pull the big fight on leviathan and save the world together again. they have just seen the beginning of all the time and universe, what can they possibly be scared of.

"All the creation accompanies death, all the extinction accompanies new life. That's the natural order. You can't save every single human being, you can't save all living life, you can't save a star." "But at least we can try. And we will." That's what Dean's made of. That's what Cas loves him for. That's the story of them.

(Note 1: the chapters where Cas went away, write in Dean's POV or 3rd POV)

(Note 2: doesn't need to be in the same order as the organized timeline idea, could rewind and skip, especially the time jump events, bc Dean'll revisit with him, so doesn't have to write twice, can go through Dean POV, only detail them on 2nd trip)

### Claim info

#### Claim summary

"What are you gonna do?"

"I don't know. Isn't that amazing?"

When Cas is broken (crazy!Cas time, end of S7), every time he runs away from a quarrel, like the times in the hospital or in the shelter when Dean gets so angry at him and he flies away, and everyone thinks he just flies into a different *place* at the same *time*, but they're wrong. Cas goes back in time, he flies to the past where no one can find him, and Dean was not there, so he gets to wait out for the time to pass slowly, where he would be alone and quiet and feel safe, until the current time catches up again and Dean finds him again. Like the time in the hospital, when Dean finds him in the dayroom, and thinks they just part for two minutes, but actually Cas has been sitting there for days, simmering in the solitary, playing games with himself, calming himself down.

And every time the quarrel gets more fierce, he needs longer to calm down. He flies farther and farther back into the past, where he can spend hundreds of thousands of years on his own without disturbance, piecing himself back together. Dean thinks he wakes up the night before they meet again, but actually Cas has been in the past for ages, that's why he said "it took everything to get me here." Which literally means eons of time.

And then there's a big quarrel between them again, when Dean tells him "You don't get a damned cat," Cas flies away again. This time, he flies too far and can't sit outside of the history he's in. And every time he touches the history, he messes something up accidentally, so he tries to fix it by tracing farther back, and making things worse, in a loop. He goes back to medieval time during witch trial, Pompeii during eruption day, the very early human evolution time when he supports Neanderthals more than the homo sapiens, the day the asteroid falls onto the Earth and dinosaurs extinct, the day the first fish moves onto the land, the day the Earth takes the shape, and the asteroid belt in solar system is still a star. Every little change has a butterfly effect, and when he tries to save the lives during his visit, Cas screws up the timeline. He has to turn to Dean for help again, and Dean traces back in time with him, seeing all the big moments of human evolution and world formation, what does it even mean to be a human, or to be a world, or the nature rule and choices. Dean gets to see things in a much broader view than any human ever can, only an angel like Cas can, Dean finally starts getting to understand Cas.

They fix things together, undo the changes Cas did, unsave the people and creature and lives Cas tried to save, unmake the star Cas tried to make. And during the process, Cas's brokenness is gradually healed, they get to understand each other, Dean starts to learn to be patient and not always so angry. Then they go back to their old current timeline, the year 2012, go back dealing with leviathan problem, and Cas is willing to help them out. And with all they learned, they know the rules and they're not afraid of anything anymore. They have just seen the beginning of all the time and universe, what can they possibly be scared of.

#### Visual description

Dean and Cas floating in the space, watching the galaxy, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is still a star -- the star that's never been there, the star they have to break so human history can be preserved and all that any human being can remember are its pieces scattering in the space.

Or any other moment during the timeline traceback journey: Dean and Cas in Pompeii, watching the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius; or Dean and Cas in Jurassic time, watching asteroids hitting the Earth and dinosaurs extinct; or they watch the first grey fish climbing to the land, or they hang out with the very primal human species Neanderthals, dancing around a campfire, etc.

(Personally love the first one most, or could maybe find a way to combine multiple visual elements together)

### Post info

#### Post summary

"What are you gonna do?"

"I don't know. Isn't that amazing?"

<br>

When an angel loses control of his mind, he's just a frightened child.

And when a frightened child can go to all the time and all the places in the universe, where would he go?

He goes to see a city that disappeared two thousand years ago, a creature he hasn't seen in millennia, a fish that is on its way to the shore, and a star that is on the edge of explosion. He watches them with the wonder of a child's eyes, and can't help but reach out his hands to help them, for he only wishes to save the lives. That is when everything -- the history, the reality -- starts crumbling down.

And Dean, already exhausted from all the burden of world-saving, with all the Leviathans crawling in his world, has to travel to eons ago, with his best and broken angel friend, to save the world and bring him home.

This is a journey for a human to see things no human has ever seen before, to learn so much more than he ever expected, and in the end, to realize something, so important, so essential, that he'd be blind to not realize it in the first place.

#### Excerpt

Castiel gets off the bed hurriedly, then takes a step away from her. "Please don't be angry. I don't want to fight."

He disappears with the sound of wings flapping.

"What the hell?" Meg stares at the empty room.

Meg finds him in the dayroom down the hall, two minutes later.

Castiel is in the middle of a chess game with himself, half the chess pieces from each side taken from the board.

"What was that?" Meg approaches the two angels suspiciously. Neither of them look up from the game. One of them wears his iconic trench coat, the other a white hospital gown, ruffled from sleeping in.

Meg knows Castiel's trench coat still hangs on the foot of his bed.

"Do you know there was a game in 19th century so famous that it's called the 'Immortal Game'?" the Castiel in the trench coat says, moving a bishop on the board.

"But the game isn't really immortal," the Castiel sitting opposite him moves a knight in defense.

"No, I mean, WHAT?" Meg walks up to the table, staring at both of them. "Who are you?" Her fingers fumble behind her back, clutching a hidden angel blade.

"I'm Castiel," the angel in the trench coat tells her plainly.

"And I'm Castiel," the other one says, with a warm smile, as if playing chess with oneself is the most normal thing in his life.

"Uh-hum." Meg doesn't loosen her angel blade, unconvinced.

"It's nice to be somewhere quiet," the trench coat Castiel says, dropping his eyes, "especially when Dean is angry."

Meg scrutinizes him carefully, and she points out the obvious, slowly, "Dean is not here."

The trench coat Cas tells her, "He is -- or, he will be." He checks the clock on the dayroom wall. "In about twenty-four hours."

### Editing notes

the chapters where Cas went away, write in Dean's POV or 3rd POV

doesn't need to be in the same order as the organized timeline idea, could rewind and skip, especially the time jump events, bc Dean'll revisit with him, so doesn't have to write twice, can go through Dean POV, only detail them on 2nd trip

### Chap. 1 Two Minutes

> (Cas POV, starting from S07E21)
>
> Start with "I heard a ping that pierced me" (only angel can hear it): crazy!Cas wake up, broken, mind wanders about everything in the universe, insects, small things
>
> Dean comes, canon quarrel of asking for help but Cas run away, Dean chase him into dayroom, Cas slip "been here for weeks" "what do you mean for weeks, I just saw you two minutes ago" "that's three weeks ago for me. It's quiet here, it's nice."

When he wakes up, it is dark outside.

It is at night, and he is on the planet Earth. Lying on a soft surface.

Castiel does not open his eyes for a few minutes. Letting the surrounding settling down on him slowly, like nights falling on the Earth.

He does not need to open his eyes to see.

The air smells sharp with disinfectant and cleaning odors, with a touch of fragrance. The chemicals floating in the air along with dust and pollens.

The window has a slit opening, the night breeze fluttering inside like the breath of a ghost.

Castiel sits up slowly.

"What is that sound?" He asks the air. The voice comes out of his throat forms a human language. He remembers he's in a vessel.

"The thunder, you mean?" A female answers him, from a chair sitting left of his bed.

The figure sits on that chair is a shape of shadow, residing inside another vessel. A demon, he recognizes. Then he remembers her name.

Castiel does not notice the thunder until this moment. The thunder and lightning outside the window is quite noticeable, now that he turns to the window. He does not know why he doesn't notice them earlier. There might be a rain coming down. The air smells fresh dirt -- petrichor.

"No, a bright 'ping,' like a lovely Christmas bell. It wakes me up." Castiel tells the demon with a smile. "You can't hear it, because you're not an angel."

Meg looks him up and down with cautious eyes, "Welcome back, Clarence."

Castiel examines his own hands, like they are something he's never seen before. "I haven't been to anywhere," he answers, then thinks for a moment, "but you're right, there are so many places I can go."

Meg frowns at him, "What do you mean? Where do you want to go?"

"Somewhere in the universe," Castiel tells her, considering, voice soft, "some time."

"Great, good as nothing." Meg puts down the magazine in her hands, turning on the bedside lamp, studying him closely. "Something different about you," she denotes, "how you feel? Everything alright? I need to make a phone call."

Castiel smiles wilder. "I've never been better," he announces, then holds out a finger. "Pull my finger."

Meg looks at his eyes, then his index finger, as if it's a bomb she needs to defuse. "What?"

"My finger," Castiel nods encouragingly, "pull it."

Meg touches his fingertip tentatively.

The bulb in the lamp explodes, shattering glass flying in all directions.

Castiel chuckles in the darkness. "Isn't it fun?" he asks cheerfully.

Meg stares at him. "What the fuck, something is definitely wrong with you."

She fuddles to replace the bulb. The new light is bright orange, the color of sunset.

The corner of Castiel's lip drops slightly at the comment. "You cursed," he blinks.

Meg looks at him unbelievably. "Damn right I did, news flash, I'm a demon, I curse." She raises her voice, "What's your problem?"

Castiel gets off the bed hurriedly, then takes a step away from her. "Please don't be angry. I don't want to fight."

He disappears with the sound of wings flapping.

"What the hell?" Meg stares at the empty room.

Meg finds him in the dayroom down the hall, two minutes later.

Castiel is in the middle of a chess game with himself, half the chess pieces from each side taken from the board.

"What was that?" Meg approaches the two angels suspiciously. Neither of them look up from the game. One of them wears his iconic trench coat, the other a white hospital gown, ruffled from sleeping in.

Cas very quickly reappear and disappear, drop a red-haired woman with a 7y-old boy at doorstep, who slips names they're Rowena & Fergus MacLeod.

(**Warning words before chapter:** canon-typical anger control issue, Dean isn't very friendly or patient with Cas, some part can be upsetting, heavy angst)

<br>

Dean lingers in the Impala a while too long before Sam urges him.

The hospital looks as shabby as when they left, with a broken angel inside.

Sam eyes his reluctant figure, "You ready?"

Dean swallows, shaking his head. "We raced all the way here and now I don't know."

He chews on the bitter taste of his own words, remembering how Sam looked like when Cas took over all the ugly and nasty hell leftovers, and the frightening look in the angel's eyes when he glanced up at them the moment those venom sank in. And that was before he went into comatose.

Dean's never going to be ready.

He walks into the angel's room with a pounding heart.

The room is dark, with only a dim light on the ceiling. Glass residues glitter on the floor.

Cas is in his old trench coat, standing straight, staring out of the window. Impala parks not far from that window.

"Hey, Cas." Dean breathes out his name, barely more than a whisper. He feels like wiping his eyes.

Cas turns to him, with a gentle smile. Not counting the hospital gown, he looks all good and familiar. Warm and peaceful. Happy, even.

"Outside today, in the garden, I followed a honeybee," he tells them, looking into Dean's eyes. Then starts talking about flowers and honey, and cat's tongue.

His voice is eager and cheerful, lost the low gravel tone he carried with for years. Almost like Jimmy's when Cas wasn't in him.

Dean studies the lines on his face, the smile on his cheeks, the crinkles at the corner of his eyes.

Those look all wrong. He looks all wrong.

Dean hates himself for thinking that, but the Cas standing before him, is not the Cas he knew -- not entirely, anyway. Almost like meeting that future Cas in the Croatoan world, the one that was so broken and human. And here he is, once again.

Dean stares at him so hard as if trying to see through him, looking inside, pealing off the exterior joyful smiling Cas that isn't making any sense, finding the real him hidden somewhere inside. He can't find it. And he doesn't know what to do.

He sees broken glasses on the floor. He only sees things that are broken.

But they have bigger things to worry about. They have a whole world crawling with monsters to save. Dean looks back in Cas's eyes, thinking, *They don't have time to take things slowly. They just don't have time.*

He hates himself for the thought anyway.

He doesn't even ask Cas how bad it is.

"Buck up, buddy, we need your help," Dean pleads quietly.

Cas glances him quickly. "I don't involve in violence anymore. Please understand."

Dean stuffs the tablet they found into Cas's hands. "Can you read it?"

Cas squints at the tablet like reading through old man's reading glasses, holding the tablet closer then farther, tilting his head this way and that. "'Tree'?"

He looks up at them like a child looking for praise of recognizing a new word. Dean just frowns at him.

Cas turns back to the tablet. "'Horse'? 'Fiddler crab'? I don't know, I can't read it. It wasn't meant for angels."

"Then what are you doing? Playing word puzzle? Bullshitting craps?" Dean's patience is running thin. "We're running out of time here, Cas!"

Cas flinches, shoving the tablet back into Dean's hands, taking a step away from him, his head bowed low, eyes on the floor. "Please, there is no need for anger here, Dean."

Dean takes a step closer to him, narrowing their distance, standing in his personal space, "Oh, really? Because I shouldn't be pissed that the world is ending, *again*? That there are monsters everywhere and this is all *your fault*? But then you just fucking died and got amnesia and then gone all wild, leaving *me* cleaning up your mess? Tell you what, Cas, why don't you go ahead clean up your own mess this time. Actually go save something, because I am so tired --"

"Dean..." Sam calls out behind him, in his usual peacemaker's tone. Dean ignores him.

Cas just stares at him three inches away with widened panicked eyes, like a cornered little creature. Wordless.

"You got anything to say about that?" Dean pushes down the bitter taste bubbling in his throat, doesn't give in. Blood is boiling in his veins, pounding on either side of his temples.

Cas opens his mouth, but no sound comes out of it. He flashes him another sad, alarmed look, then there is the sound of wings. The air stirs, and the angel is gone.

"Friggin' angels!" Dean doesn't hide his frustration, throwing his hands in the air, "He's like a child! Running away like that, where the hell did he go?"

"Dean, he can be anywhere." Sam says in a worried voice. "For all we know, he can be in any *time*."

Meg sighs, "He's down in the dayroom now. I guarantee it. And Dean? Try not to startle him, will ya?"

Dean shoots her a glare. "I'm not dead enough to let a demon tell me how to handle an angel."

He moves down the hallway.

<br>

The dayroom is at the end of the hall, far away from all the other patient rooms. It has all the usual hospital look, white blue wallpaper with uglyass letters wishing you a good health, plastic chairs around small square tables. The air smells disgustingly fresh with too much artificial fragrance to cover the possibly never-ending, distinctive stale smell of death and sickness.

Cas sits straight at the chair at the far end of the room, near a window. His back to the door.

Dean takes a deep breath walking toward him.

There is a stack of board game boxes piling at the edge of the table. Cas sits with two hands under his chin, deep in thought.

"Hey," Dean regards him for a second, aiming for a softer voice. But even he knows the echo of his yell is still lingering in the air. He can even hear them himself.

"Hello, Dean." Cas comes out of his meditation, looking almost cheerful to see him, as if he has forgotten everything harsh he just said. Is the angel extra forgiven these days or does he have a goldfish's memory now?

Dean swallows.

"Didn't mean to yell at you earlier," Dean mumbles quickly. He's not gonna apologize.

Cas just nods briefly.

"It's forgotten," he says gently. "It's been a while anyway."

"A while?" Dean frowns. "It's like two minutes ago."

"It's been weeks for me." Cas answers.

Slow understanding pieces the information back together.

"You flied back in time." Dean says with realization, "How long you've been sitting here?"

"About three weeks, I think." Cas thinks about it. "I went to play a chess with myself, and other games. I knew all the move I did, but it's still fun. It's quiet here, just me and myself."

Dean stares at him unbelievably. "Did you just fly back in time 'cause you know I wasn't there, so you wouldn't have to see me?"

Cas blinks rushedly, then, quietly, "No."

Dean sighs, "Can you stop being a child?" Cas tilts his head, Dean adds, "Please?"

Cas looks down at the center of the table.

"What I said just now -- three weeks ago, whatever -- my points stand." Dean stares him down with a deep frown. "We could really use your help to take down the Leviathans."

"I don't fight anymore." Cas answers quietly, insistent, "I watch bees."

"God damn it, Cas, not a good time for retiring!" Dean is on the edge of snapping again. "Do you remember what you did?"

Cas turns away, reaching out for a board game box, showing the title side to him. The box reads, "Sorry!"

Dean closes his eyes, taking a deep breath. He takes the game box away from Cas, setting it back on the table side, on top of a chess board.

"You don't get to say 'Sorry' after you slaughter countless people," he says in a cold voice. "You button up your coat and make amends. You try your best undo the damage, even if it costs you everything, at least you'd know you tried your best fixing it, not just hiding behind playing shitty games." He fixes Cas with a stare, "'Cause that's what a coward do. Tell me you're better than that."

Cas swallows, shifting his eyes onto the game box stack again. And he says, "Would you like a different game?"

<br>

Dean wants to scream, he wants to bang his head on the wall until one of them cracks. He doesn't care which. As long as something to do, something to take them out of this stalemate silence.

They have come back to the shelter -- Rufus's cabin in Montana, the closest place they get to lay low and maybe call a base camp ever since Bobby's place got burned down. The broken angel is in the kitchen, washing plates. They get jack squat on how to end Dick and his monster army or save the world. And the clock is ticking.

The restlessness in the room is suffocating.

How can Cas still work on things as mundane as "washing dishes"? Like he's totally a human in a totally normal world, like they're just camping out in a cabin for fun?

Dean stares at his hunched back. Cas is wiping his hand on a washing cloth. *Unbelievable.*

Sam is rummaging through the books god knows how many times as if answers will just pop out of there by themselves magically like a Jack-in-the-box -- they have read those texts for tons of times already and found Jack squat. Meg is... doing whatever demons do, Dean doesn't keep a tab, but he salted the door and windows.

Cas turns back from the kitchen sink, hands still drying a plate. "Do we need a cat?" he asks, eyes wide and innocent, "Doesn't this place feel one species short? Probably why it's so quiet all the time."

Anger swells in Dean's chests like a balloon.

"Would a cat help us kill Dick and save the world?" Dean hears himself asking. He feels a disapproval glare from Sam's direction, maybe Meg's too, he disregards them.

Cas turns back to the sink, putting the clean plate down. "No," he mutters.

"Then why the hell do we care?" Dean stands up, walking in Cas's direction. Sam hesitates a step toward him, looks unsure of whether to stop him.

"I..." Cas throws a quick flustered look at his approaching figure, "I just thought..."

"You just thought what, Cas? That we can pretend nothing bad is happening, the world is not ending? That as long as you keep making us burgers and washing plates, everything will just be fine, we can just be a happy normal family forever?" Dean feels blood pumping into his head, the veins at his temples thudding with his words. There might be blood in his eyes too because the world looks extra red and burning to him. "Just tell me, what are you thinking, by not doing anything? Are things just gonna fix themselves? Or are you thinking we'll just magic things up at the last minute, like we always do? 'Cause you know what, I run out of ideas, we might as well just all sit around and wait for the world to end while watching some fucking TV!"

Dean can't help himself, his fingers itching at punching something. He marches to the kitchen sink, Cas ducks to the corner of the room. Dean grabs the damned plate in the sink, throwing it at the wall with all his force. "SO HELP ME!"

The ceramic plate shatters to pieces with a loud clash.

Cas disappears with a fluttering sound of the wings.

Dean glances around, not seeing him. "Typical," he mumbles, feeling even shittier than before.

<br>

(**Words after the chapter**: Please hang in there with me, I hate writing angry Dean but it's sort of just necessary for the story's purpose, really need a conflict situation to make Cas fly away. Things will get better shortly, promise.)

#### draft notes

to make contrast with the ending, the beginning emphasize on: <u>Cas unwilling to help leviathan problem, Cas super broken, Dean super impatient</u>

When Cas was broken, every time he ran away from a quarrel, like the first time in hospital, Dean worry he can be in any time anywhere, Meg says he's just in the dayroom. And we assumed he's just fly there, a displacement, not a temporal flight, but we are wrong, everyone's wrong. He flies to the past, and he's not flying back, he takes the long way, wait out for the time to pass slowly, until it come back to the current timeline, and meet Dean in the dayroom in the now time. He can be there for hours or even weeks already. He's an angel, <u>hundreds of thousands of years is a blink</u>. He plays games with himself, he calms himself down, ~~because he was trying to forget the reminded trauma about conflict (don't touch it)~~, knows he's safe because Dean wasn't there then, <u>so he won't be disturbed no matter what</u>, the perfect place (and time) to hide to. (slips how long he's been there, that's how Dean know)

That's how he calm himself back down, piece himself back together. He would have needed way longer to piece himself together, not just a night (8pm in the night, Meg called them in the morning), <u>he has spent way longer, but that time was folded</u>, he spent them in the past, saved them so much more time, so the current him that they meet is already a sane enough version, walking and talking, mostly functional, the best he can manage for himself to be presentable. <u>Even if broken, he wants them to meet the best version of him, he doesn't want them disappointed at him.</u>

Every time there is a quarrel and he flies back, he flies back further and waits out longer. The first few times are still the recent times when they are around him, hours, then years, then decades, centuries, millenniums, he goes back to history, then pre-history. He wants to help, to make the world a better place, to fix things from the root cause, since the very first time things went wrong, so he traces back time to change history

### Chap. 3 The Red-Haired Woman

> (Rowena POV) talking about how's Cas like when they meet in Scotland, 1668, how messed up she is and how kind but broken Cas is; some news about something witchy and weird in Scotland (Rowena b. 1640, Fergus Roderick MacLeod b. 1661)

Dean does not expect to hear that sound of feathery wings again so soon. Some loose pages on the table fly to the floor.

He turns to look for Cas.

But there is no familiar color of the tan trench coat, except, right to his face, is a burning red color of a woman's long curly hair, with an auburn-haired little boy hiding behind her like a tail. Looking no more than ten years old.

He stares eyes to eyes with the woman for a moment, before snapping, "Who the hell are you?"

Glancing at the cabin's warding and not seeing any damage to them, he adds, "And how the hell did you get here?"

The thin young woman looks like shocked out of her mind, shivering like a leaf in winter. She answers with a really high-pitched voice and an authentic Scottish accent: "Where the bloody hell am I? And who the hell are *you*?!"

<br>

Ten minutes later, Sam manages to conjure up an old blanket from some corner and a glass of water.

Dean sits by the table -- the books are moved to the floor now, the table serving its real purpose for the moment -- watching the red-haired woman sipping the water.

"Now, talk." Dean tries very hard to not snap, but the long days are wearing out his temper rapidly.

The woman shoots him a glare, frowning at the glass. "You don't have any whiskey or anything strong? What is this, not even tea? What are you, English?"

Dean rolls his eyes. "Americans! We are Americans."

"That explains it," the woman thins her lips, drinks some more water, and pushes the glass to the little boy. The boy grabs the glass with two chubby little hands.

"Why don't you start with a name?" Dean tries.

"Didn't you mom tell you never to give out your names or you will burn?" the woman mocks.

"New rule in America, what about staying all Riddler and you get shot?" Dean doesn't so much as to reach for his gun, merely glancing at the weapon stock hanging on the wall, figuring that should make the point clear enough.

"Dean!" Sam warns him, sitting down at the other side of the table, reaching out a hand to the red-haired woman. "Sorry about my brother's manner, we've been through a lot. So you've met my brother, Dean, and I'm Sam."

The red-haired woman shakes his hand cautiously. "Pleasure," she amuses, giving him a once-over with a tight smirk, "I like you more than your brother. You can call me 'Red' if you want, some villagers do that."

Dean exchanges a look with Sam meaning "That's obviously not her real name" and "Who wouldn't give their names? Bad guys", and Sam returns with a light shrug, meaning "I don't care, this is good enough. Go easy on her, Dean" and "Not everyone is a bad guy".

Dean turns his attention back to the red-haired woman. "Alright, *Red*," he presses on the name as if this can push her telling something she's been holding her tongue so tight about, "Why don't you share your side of the story, and we can decide what to do from there?"

The woman starts: "It is the year 1668 to me. Canisbay, Scotland is just on the edge of a sweet wee summer time..."

<br>

<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">

<br>

It is the year 1668. Canisbay, Scotland is just on the edge of a sweet wee summer time.

That strange young man came into the village three days ago. The villagers didn't like him much, because he was just too strange -- even for us. He didn't talk much, he didn't walk around, he didn't eat or drink.

He just stood in the moor, watching the sheep and cattle. Some people thought he was up to no good and wanted to steal their beloved stock. They were talking about getting him out of the town.

I wasn't paying him much attention either, in the beginning.

I was frustrated, and thinking about some probably really bad ideas -- if you must know, I was thinking about how to revenge that heartless man and his rich wife, the bastards deserve something nice and sweet, I just haven't decided which way works the best.

When I was deep in thought, the little brat ran off again, like he always did when I was doing my things. I probably should keep him chained like a dog just to be safe.

Anyway, he ran away, directly into the farm land where he really shouldn't go in. Cattles are like giant beasts to him, and he could so easily just get treaded like a shepherd's pie.

I was already thinking where to bury this little thing, when that man appeared before me, my boy in his arms. That was the first time I really looked at him, and he had such blue eyes.

He said I should take better care of my boy, and I said thank you. My little thing said he ran there because he saw a pretty little flower, and this strange man just walked over to the flock, picked that most normal yellow whin from the moor and walked back. I had to invite him to tea after that.

"I'm here for the whins, too," he said when he sat down in my little hut. My boy was playing with the petals, trying to eat it.

I asked where he came from.

"Far away," that's what he said. He looked at me in a way even I felt bad for him. Those blue, blue eyes, I think they were talking, more than he actually spoke. I asked him if he traveled a lot.

"Quite a lot lately, yes," he said with a smile. Such a gentle bright smile. No one smiled at me like that for ages.

"You must miss home then, mister," I said.

"Castiel," he said, the smile turned a teeny little sad, extremely imperceptible, but trust my eyes, I could tell. And then he said -- but I was sure that wasn't meant for me -- he said, "Miss it, yes, but I don't think I'm welcomed there anymore."

"You're welcome to stay here, if it doesn't bore you," I told him. My humble little living place was just a barn no one wanted or looked. The village had a chapel and really not much going on -- not the best tourist spot, you might say.

"It's a lovely place," he said. His voice was so... in awe, I'm sure no one in history said that about Canisbay like he did ever before, not even the one who built it.

"It has the most beautiful whins of all places, and this is the best summer of all the time," he said.

I had to admit I would never know what's the difference of those teeny tiny flowers had this year or last, but apparently someone has been keeping records for them.

"And the bees too," he added, then carried on talking about sheep and cattle and pasture, but that's when I started getting bored and stopped listening.

"As much as I'd love to be your company, mister," I told him, "I had work to do."

I didn't really have a "work" to do, but I consider my planning for the future an important task. And of course, I didn't want him stay long enough to notice my cauldron or grimoire.

He apologized and left.

At the sunset that day, when I walked past that field, he was still standing there, facing the west. The sheep and cattle had gone, I think he was just watching the color of the sun on the grass then.

I saw him again the next day but we didn't talk.

And the third day -- third time is the charm, isn't it? -- I walked past him as I was tied backhanded, the villagers were cheering and waving torches.

Did I forget to mention, witch hunting was a really popular sport around the area these days? They just love to tie you up and roast you, and I guess this was just my day. Fergus cried so loud, but I asked him to shut up. This day would be the day that the world saw me as who I am, and for once, those uncivilized villagers would be right on their idiotic random guess.

I don't blame them.

They were quite right about the cauldron not being a pot for cooking soup for my boy's cold or the grimoire not a draw book for just scribbling and killing time.

The stake they tied me to was quite high and hot, and I was thinking I should have worn the other black dress -- I wouldn't mind that one burnt, but this one, I liked this red one.

Then the fire started. The smoke was the first bothering thing. I couldn't breathe, let alone saying any spell. I was very busy cursing all of them. Fergus cried so loudly, I was pretty sure the whole Scotland could hear his noisy shrieking sound.

And then I saw that strange young man in the trench coat again -- Castiel stood in the crowd, behind everyone, far away at the edge, looking at me with his big, sad eyes. I thought -- I saw, those blue eyes lighted up somehow.

The next thing I know, I'm here, standing in the room, surrounded by two men interrogating me just like those bloody peasants.

It would be nice if mister Castiel could just explain what he'd done. If it was wizardry, it was far more powerful than I had ever known, and I'd really like to learn from the best.

<br>

<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">
<br>

The woman licks her lips as she finishes. "Well?" She raises her eyebrows, "Are we done with the story-telling time?"

Dean swallows, frowning down at the table, then glances at Sam.

Sam asks, "The kid, did you say his name is Fergus?"

"Aye," the red-haired woman replies easily.

Dean stiffens. "Tell me the last name is not MacLeod."

"How do you know?" The woman eyes both of them carefully, pulling the boy closer to her. "Meet Fergus Roderick MacLeod."

"Hello," the boy smiles at them shily.

"How old is he?"

"Seven after this winter."

"And you are?" Dean asks with a tight voice.

"Rowena MacLeod, at your service." The woman finally tells them.

Sam springs to his feet, gesturing to Dean. "Can I talk to you for a sec?" Right when Dean is also jumping to his feet.

"Yeah, just about to say the same."

<br>

"What the hell?"

"I know, right?"

"That's Crowley."

"When he's barely seven."

"What do we do about them?"

"Isn't that like the world's ultimate fucked-up moral question: What do you do with baby Hitler if you could time travel to when he was an infant?"

"Why would Cas even bring them here?"

"I don't know, maybe he's trying to help, like I asked him to, you know? Maybe he thought if we could figure out something from them, we could change things. We might still get a chance to win."

"Or maybe he was just there watching the flowers and so happened to run into a witch hunt, and he was just trying to save some poor woman and her young kid, who turned out happened to be the future King of Hell in like three hundred years."

"Yeah, maybe that. And also, don't forget, the woman turned out to be a real witch."

"I never know Crowley had a witch mother."

"Tell me about that."

"Where is Cas now?"

"How would I know?"

"You didn't try to pray to him?"

"Dude, I'm probably the last person he wants to see now. He dropped them by without showing up a feather. Didn't you listen, she said he said he didn't think he'd be welcome here, and that's all on me."

"Then tell him he's wrong, and you're sorry."

Dean stares at Sam intensely, who stares him back with equal intensity.

Dean averts the look, head tilting back at the witch and the very human kid -- human kid Crowley who still goes by Fergus, but that's Crowley to him already. "But what do we do with them now?"

They are standing at the corner of the room, farthest to the table, but who knows if the witch might have some super hearings, they lower their voices to barely whispers for the heated discussion.

Sam follows his eyes, sighing. "I don't know. Feed them, I guess? Be good and kind to them so Crowley wouldn't turn out to be such a big dick?"

"You want to freaking *raise* the King of Hell?" Dean almost forgets to keep his voice low. Sam shushes him eagerly. "What, so that we can see the world change or his memory change in twenty years? Face the reality, Sam, we might not live another month with everything out there!"

"Or maybe ask for her help? A witch in our team gotta be better than nothing. Maybe there's a spell Cas knew that she knew and we could use."

Dean thinks about that. "Alright, you do that, talk to her, father the kid, whatever, I'll try Cas."

"Sounds like a plan." Sam nods.

<br>

#### draft notes

Rowena b. 1640, Fergus Roderick MacLeod b. 1661

Cas fly away from Scotland because of the violence & conflict (from witch hunting)

Rowena: self-loathing, newly deserted by the rich man going back to his rich wife, feel weak, "if I don't hate you, I would love you", not cruel yet but angry, hatred of the world bc cruelty, b. 1640, now 28y, Fergus 7y; Cas ≈ Oskar to her for now, be kind to her, but can't change anything fundamentally

### Chap. 4 The Man From Roman

> (Dean POV) Cas comes and goes without seeing Dean again and drop a family from a small town in Italy, meanwhile newspaper about something mundane in Pompeii (saying in a way like it's normal), MET museum see something weird about volcano exhibition. The dropped family are Caecilius's family
>
> (Caecilius POV) telling them about Pompeii life, 79 AD (year of "Consulhood of Vespasian and Titus") Aug 24 (eruption day), the Cas from his POV, different from Dean's POV, Dean sidetracked from leviathan problem, prioritizing Cas → boys begin to have a guess what's Cas doing, Dean pray to Cas come back before messing up more things

The plan is disrupted by a massive explosion -- explosions, plural, and both figuratively and literally. The ground shakes violently once, twice, then a third time.

From outside their half-covered window, they can see purple smoke rising from the ground in the distance. Rowena's eyes lighten up with the same shade of bright purple light at almost the same time, inhaling sharply. "It's happening," she say, staring into the space in front of her, eyes unfocused, wide with excitement.

"What's happening?" Sam dashes to her, alerted.

"So many new lives in the magic, I can feel them. So many saved," Rowena mutters. "Oh I think the angel is saving us, saving us from all those terrible, terrible fate from those old, dark ages. Thank you, Castiel."

Dean changes an alarming look with Sam.

"What did he do this time?" Dean mouths.

Sam shakes his head, turning on the TV. The purple smoke and light isn't only happening in the states, apparently. The breaking news reports it's happening everywhere in the worldwide, but experts have located the first wave starting from Scotland, near the old site of villages where rumor has it the most women have been accused of witchery and burned to death during popular Witch Hunting activities about three hundred years ago.

"The ground zero time matches," Sam murmurs quietly. "And the location."

"You think Cas bringing her here is causing all this?" Dean winces. They should know, when has the time travel shenanigan stops being a pain in the ass and causes more trouble than it fixes? *Back to the Future*, *12 Monkeys*, *Doctor Who*, take you pick. They even had that *Titanic* accident merely a year ago, surely Cas wouldn't forget that?

Dean starts pacing without himself noticing. "Cas, whatever you're doing in Scotland, stop and come back to us, alright? We don't need another global witch problem on top of the Leviathan problem -- unless, I don't know, they cancel each other out. But I wouldn't bet on that."

He takes a breath, looking up at the ceiling. "I'm sorry about lashing out on you earlier, alright? I'm just..." he sighs. "We're running out of time, and I can really use your help. So, Houston to Cas, stop running around and come back here, you hear me?"

Dean closes his eyes and focuses on his thought, calling Cas's name in his mind a couple more times for good measure, then opens his eyes again.

He looks around, waiting expectedly. Sam, too.

The news flash on TV catches their attention before the fluttering air in the room does -- though they practically happen at the same time.

One second the reporter was standing in the Scotland high ground, showing a burst of purple-cloud explosion behind her, the next, the image is cut to a new breaking news from New York. The Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) reports their current exposition of volcanic exhibition have to stop, because the local government of Pompeii, Italy protests that the local people want their households back. In fact, their local government has made a long series of protests and announcements just as the reporters going to the site, as if the people are just waking up from a collective dream. The archeologists in the city report that they are very confused as to why they were even there, since the city is vigorous with life, with no visible buried fossil under volcanic lava as they previously seem to remember.

"That's our home!" A man speaks behind them, pointing at the TV screen.

Dean and Sam turn around sharply.

There, in the middle of the cabin, stand four people dressed like ancient Romans from vintage movies or shows, with long tunic and coat wrapping around their body and bare feet. The man standing in front of the group looks about middle age, with his wife and two adolescent-looking son and daughter stand behind him.

With the accident with Rowena, Dean has a pretty good guess why they are here. But he still takes another look around them, trying vainly to find their flight driver -- but unsurprisingly, the angel isn't anywhere in sight. Dean lets out another frustrated sigh.

"Great, more history refugee," Dean mumbles, making sure it's quiet enough only Sam can hear him.

"You think Cas did that?" Sam whispers back.

"You see a second man with wings flying around like a child?" Dean bites back.

"I thought you said you're gonna apologize to him! Not, you know, trigger him even worse!" Sam grumbles, not really accusing but it certainly sounds like one to Dean's ears.

"I did!" Dean glares at his brother, shifting his feet uneasily. "Sort of, I think. He has wings! What can I do to stop him flying around? Not like I can fly with him, am I?"

Sam shakes his head disapprovingly.

"Can you tell me where we are and what happened?" The ancient Pompeii man asks politely.

They are so focused on their problem they'd even forget that mysteriously dropped family are probably still having some jet lag for a two-thousand-year fast forward flight.

Sam takes the burden of showing them a warm welcome from 2012 -- as "warm" as they can manage, anyway.

The man's name is Caecilius. He tells them. With his wife Metella, daughter Evelina, and his son Quintus.

"We were just having a normal day, when that man came from nowhere," Caecilius recalls.

"Let me guess, blue eyes, ruffled hair, tan trench coat?" Dean chimes in tiredly.

"Yes." Caecilius looks up at him. "He said his name is Castiel, and we had to leave with him because we were in danger."

"Must be the Volcano Day, you think?" Sam asks sideways toward Dean, who nods slightly.

"What's 'vol-ca-no'?" Caecilius interrupts confusedly.

Sam frowns, then, "Oh, I almost forget the word 'volcano' wasn't invented until that day."

"Is the big angry fire mountain near your house particularly active that day?" Dean asks instead, "Puffing hot smokes, bubbling dragon breath, grumbling sound from under the ground? Animals and pets running round, leaving the city?"

"Mount Vesuvius has always been like that," Caecilius considers, "but never anything real or dangerous coming out of it."

"Well, not until that day." Dean corrects him.

Caecilius looks from Dean to Sam, then back to him, frowning with thoughts. "But then why us? If that's true, there are twenty thousand people in the city, why only save us?"

"I'm pretty sure it's not just you," Dean glances at the TV, which is showing the street scenes in Pompeii now, seeming like just any other normal-looking village with normal people walking around in a normal day.

"Because I prayed, Dad," the daughter suddenly speaks, "and I think he's an angel. He heard me."

"Yeah, he does that," Dean nods reflexively, "sometimes. Can you give us a minute?" He pats on Sam's shoulder as he stands up. The father turns around to talk something rapidly with his daughter.

Sam follows him to the corner of the cabin, keeping a distance with the family and the still-purple-eyed wicky Rowena and the kid Crowley.

"You thinking what I'm thinking?" Dean starts.

"At least now we know the last place Cas visited, and the time. Pompeii's Eruption Day, of all the time."

"As if we're not busy enough to save one world at one time, he has to come around saving other ones. In history!"

"Maybe he's just trying to help?"

"How? How does a suddenly non-extinct city in Italy that's supposed to be buried underground two thousand years ago help us fighting Leviathans?"

"I don't know, but maybe, alright? He's an angel, he might see things in a grand schema that we don't know about. And don't forget, Cas can be a strategist too, he led the Heaven Civil War before."

"Yeah, and that's when he decided un-sinking Titanic was a great idea! Why am I having the feeling he's not really being *strategic*, just wandering around in the timeline and do what he can when he can, like a child." Dean rubs his eyes tiredly. "I don't really know what to do anymore, Sam, I'm worried. If only he can just come back to us and listen, and talk!"

"Then ask that in your prayer. He might listen if you really mean it."

"You don't think I tried?"

"Try harder, Dean. It's Cas." Sam gives him a look.

Dean sighs, nodding briefly.

Sam goes back to the room now crowded with people.

Dean stands at the threshold of the cabin, looking up at the sky. "Cas," he whispers under his breath, thinking. He has to pause there for a second too long to compose his thoughts. He remembers the last wounded look on Cas's face when he couldn't help snapping at him and the angel decided to run away to Scotland and Italy.

He lets his breath out, long and slow. "I'm not mad at you, Cas," he tells the sky slowly. "Please, we can fix this, together. You and me, whatever we did, " -- he managed to use "we" instead of "you" there, forcing himself to not turn to the angry Hulk mode again, "we can fix this. We can save lives." *I can save you,* his mind supplies, when his voice is choked in the throat, *like all those times you saved me.*

*Come back to me, Cas. Please.*

He stares at the sky hard. Feeling his eye sockets hot.

*I need you.*

*Whatever state you're in, at the end of the day, you're still my best friend, my family.*

Then he waits.

<br>

(**Words after chapter:**

This chapter in its entirety is inspired by Doctor Who S04E02 *The Fires of Pompeii*. It's just too tempting not to write the crazy broken Cas pays a visit to Pompeii, trying to save as many people as he can, with single mindset being "he has to save people" like Dean told him to.

There is a known loophole I don't want to get into trouble fixing so I pretend it's not there: Let's just pretend ancient people from Pompeii also speaks fluent English and they can understand each other just fine.)

#### draft notes

Pompeii, stop the volcano, save the twenty thousand people, consequence? history of Italy changed, culture development unbalanced? ← (short, in passing line) "I was in here and here and here", one of time/place: Mount Vesuvius, 79 AD eruption day Aug 24 ("the word 'volcano' wasn't invented until that day")(year of "Consulhood of Vespasian and Titus")

characters: Caecilius (banker, marble trader), Metella, Evelina, Quintus

note about Sam/Dean's assumptions about Cas's motivations: they always guessed him wrong, thinking from current world saving perspective, think Cas is doing some strategic thing, but Cas really is always on a different mindset, really only about saving what he can save at that moment, not thinking about follow-up consequences (thus child-like, and more chain reaction consequences); also just on purpose to make them fail to understand Cas, and Dean only start to really understand him after time travel with him and see the world from the space and from his pov, finally able for some real communication

### Chap. 5 Butterflies

> (Dean POV) Cas show up in his car, naked, covered in bees, talking about homo sapien sapiens & Neanderthals, early humans, Dean try to be nice, insist on him to stay, Cas afraid of him → something seriously wrong, humans split in two tribes and in forever war, Dean biologically look different and sound differently → Cas freak out, reminded of *Titanic* time, insist on fixing it himself, fly away again
>
> (Dean POV) quick forward, butterfly effect consequences almost simultaneously: news about dinosaur escape from local zoo, other humanoid species fighting against leviathans (fishperson, birdperson, etc.), asteroid rain toward Earth, extra star in orbit, immediate end of world threat
>
> Cas show up, frustrated, scared, lost, don't know what to do, every time fly back mess up more things; Dean volunteer to trace back with him, put everything back together, bringing those people back (not easy, morally difficult)

Cas doesn't come immediately.

But he does come eventually, when the world is in toilet.

The news on the TV long stopped making any sense. Archeologists, biologists, and astronomers are all twisting their minds about all the peculiar breaking news. After the report from Pompeii, there is a new one cutting in about dinosaurs escaped from zoos (which they all seem to remember all of a sudden dinosaurs are indeed common and normal to see nowadays). Then another one from NASA about asteroid rains abnormity, and the star known as Phaeton is spinning off its orbits from between Mars and Jupiter, flying toward Earth, announcing immediate end-of-world threat.

Dean turns off the TV when it starts talking about a potential war between some other humanoid species against us humans.

It's freaking butterfly effects all over the places.

What's the difference between the world ending because of one cause, versus there are probably five other different reasons it could probably end from? It must be how a doctor feels when they start treating a dying patient who's diagnosed with one deadly disease, only to find there are five other different deadly diseases hidden underneath.

The feeling is called: hopeless desperation.

"I'm going to sit in my car for a while," Dean tells Sam, already half-way walking out toward the door.

"Isn't it a little too busy for a break?" Sam looks up from his laptop.

"Don't think there's any difference." Dean answers, defeated. "Unless there's anything I can do about dinosaurs or asteroids, oh, and Leviathans -- which I don't think there is. So yeah, I'm just gonna sit in my car and listen to my cassette for a bit, and possibly take one last nap while the world ends."

He doesn't wait for Sam's answer to that.

And he does exactly what he said he would, sitting in the car, turning on the cassette tape, and resting his eyes for a moment. Just to pretend, in that simple moment, in his world inside his car, everything is fine and all the bad things are merely a nightmare.

That is when Castiel shows up.

The angel pops out of the thin air in the Impala's backseat, panting heavily and anxiously.

Dean snaps his eyes open, staring at the backseat from the rear mirror, then immediately turns around to stare at the angel in the eyes. "Cas!" he calls out. Joy and alarm each takes half the weight in his voice.

Cas's eyes are wide with horror. He can't even form a full sentence for the first five minutes as he's breathing so violently.

Dean digs out a blanket from the Impala's truck and climbs into the back seat to wrap around the startling Cas.

Cas is somehow still in his hospital gown underneath the trench coat. He shakes his head at Dean, but Dean has no idea of the meaning.

"What's wrong, Cas? What happened?" Dean asks, more worried than any time of this year. "It's okay, you're okay now. You're safe." He wraps his arms around the blanket, keeping it tighter around Cas.

Cas looks nothing remotely like an all-powerful angel now, more like a freaked-out child, terrified of monsters in his closet and refusing to turn off the light in his room at night, or a patient shivering with disease, unable to control his body.

Dean wonders if it might be true, if he might indeed just be the combination of a terrified child and a patient that's not well enough. He reminds himself that broken wall from Sam's head is still in Cas.

"I'm sorry, Dean, I'm so, so sorry." The minute Cas is able to speak again, apology is the first thing coming out of his mouth.

Dean caresses his arm where the blanket covers. For some reason, he really doesn't want to know what Cas is apologizing for, but the reasonable mind also knows it must be important. He has never seem Cas frightened like this -- perhaps only that brief second when he took over Sam's brokenness and looked up at them with the red light crawling in his veins.

Dean sighs, feeling his gut twisted in all sorts of knots. He waits for another couple of minutes before asking, just need that extra buffer to prepare himself: "What happened?"

Cas closes his eyes with deep frown. For a moment, he looks so thin and tiny under that blanket. Dean is reminded of a little wounded bird he once found, on the roadside, crippled by a car's windshield that its wings are broken, hanging pitifully behind its body. Dean tried to save it, but he was merely a boy back then, hardly knew anything about animal emergency procedures. The bird didn't survive long. But Dean would like to think it still found some comfort in the warmth of his palms instead of dying alone on the roadside, that got to mean something.

Now he thinks it might not make any difference. He still didn't save it, after all.

"Cas?" Dean croaks, waiting.

"I was trying to help," Cas whispers, voice hoarse with misery. "I only wanted to help, like you asked."

He opens his eyes. There are tears in those blue eyes, flooding out, dropping from the corner. "I wanted to help them, save them, like you did."

Dean swallows. His heart is being torn to pieces watching Cas like that. He asks quietly, "What did you do?"

"Those people were going to be burn to death, so I tried to get them out. And the ones going to be buried in ashes, I had to help them too." Cas's eyes wander from Dean's face to somewhere left of the car's window, casting to the space. "And then I remember so many others, so many deaths along the way during all those millions of years of watching. I never did anything when they died. They were so happy dancing around the fires and singing poetries."

"Who were?"

"Neanderthals," Cas answers reflexively. "And they, the dinosaurs, I mean, if we are to save lives, are they not worth saving? Do they deserve to be extinct all those millions of years ago? So I went back then, trying to help them too... And then I remember there was a planet eons ago, Phaeton, as young as Earth, as beautiful as Saturn. I should have saved it, but instead, I watched it explode. So I went back trying to correct that wrong too..."

His gaze shifts back on to Dean's face, more tears dropping. "But Dean, I think... I'm afraid I might have made everything even worse than before. I don't know what to do... I'm sorry --"

Dean closes his eyes, forcing his breath coming out slowly. He can still hear his heart pounding and blood rushing to his head, burning at the back of his brain.

He forces his voice gentle and kind when he starts talking again, slow and as patient as he can manage. "Okay, here's what we're gonna do --" He leaves a hand on Cas's shoulder, putting a reassuring weight there, hoping Cas can feel it. "-- We'll go back fixing everything you changed, one thing at a time, putting them back the way they were. You'll take me with you, no more flying around on your own, wherever you're going."

"But it can be dangerous..." Cas starts.

"All the more reasons to tag along." Dean manages to squeeze a light smile at him, a tired one, but a smile nonetheless. "Together, or not at all. You understand?"

Cas nods small. "Thank you, Dean," he murmurs with a small voice.

So it is settled.

<br>

(**After chapter notes**: I do realize there is another loophole that I can't find a neat way to fix within the length so we'll have to pretend it's not there: Whenever the history is changed in the past, their memory would have been modified to think that new reality is the normalcy without realizing anything strange, like the *Titanic* episode showed, so everything related to Pompeii should be a new normalcy, same with Neanderthals or dinosaurs situations. Then they wouldn't even know what's the problem to fix. In this version, I'm setting it as if the time line is changed but at least Dean and Sam's memory remained the same as previously -- feels it's easier to handle. Please indulge me to move on with this premise.)

#### draft notes

every time he's at some place/time, Cas accidentally or intentionally interfere the timeline, every time after the change, the people in current timeline experience the consequence immediately and take it for granted, they don't remember what's the old normal (≈ S06E17 Titanic episode, DW S5 finale), only Cas know he messed up and need help, every time he try to fix by himself by going back further and mess up worse, so have to go to Dean

every time Cas comes back from the past, Dean's more scared, bc Cas's gone farther back, and stay longer in a time he'd never be able to go and find him, Dean's fear if Cas can't time it right, next time Cas comes back, he might already be too aged and gone (similar to *Glimpse* & DW the girl in the fireplace), that's why insisted to follow him back. might be more angry, has more quarrel, Dean force himself to stop being angry, force himself to be patient, and gradually during the journey, he realized he wouldn't have to force think about that again, helped his anger control issue

when after shattering the star and made the asteroid belt, Cas is properly frightened. Sky fall apart, reality break apart by too many changes from butterfly effect, cost is mass energy compensate, paradox create crack in the reality and going to swallow Cas (or just bc Cas can't bear the mess he made to the world, self-torture even as the broken!Cas's child mind, still not worry about himself, it's about world). Cas go back to current time to Dean, Dean ask him to trace his own steps back with him, reset his changes, unsave the people he save, witness and experience everything together with him.

### Chap. 6 Scotland, 1668 (300 years ago)

> (Dean POV) trace back: take Rowena back to Scotland (1y later still deserted Fergus, etc., nothing changed), witness witch trial, normal human cruelty

They drop by Rufus' cabin briefly first -- need to pick up two passengers from the past.

Dean gives Sam a quick debrief for catching up, while Cas goes to the young boy, lowering himself so he can look at the kid in the eyes and talk to him on the same height.

"I'm so sorry," Dean hears Cas saying quietly to the human kid version of Crowley, wondering what Cas is sorry for him about. He turns his attention to his conversation with Sam after that.

"It's going to be like re-sinking *Titanic*. You sure you can do that? It's not going to be easy." Sam warns him with a quiet voice.

"No one said anything about easy," Dean glances at Cas absentmindedly, "but it has to be done. We're just changing things to make them the same as before, not like killing more people."

"It might end up feeling so. You sure you don't want me come along?"

"Nah, we still need someone in the home base. You know, sending home beacon or something."

"Pretty sure you made that one up."

"Just, stay here, keep an eye on those Pompeiians, keep researching on Leviathans. We might be back before we head out."

Sam raises an eyebrow.

Dean shrugs. "You know, the time travel stuff, we might come back early or something. *Prisoners of Azkaban* stuff --"

"I know it!" Sam beams slightly. "I know you watched it too!"

"Shut up," Dean starts walking away toward Cas. "But yeah, point stands. Let's go save the timeline."

He puts a hand on Cas's shoulder, "Whenever you're ready."

Cas nods at Rowena and Fergus. And that's their only cue of the flight taking off.

<br>

Dean still remembers his last trip to Scotland. Which so happened to be also something related to Crowley -- to dig his human remains up so that he'd return Bobby's soul. He'd never stop making mental connection between this land and Crowley ever.

Rowena doesn't seem delighted to be back here. Dean doesn't blame her. Who would ever want to come back to a place where all her neighbors would want to burn her dead.

"Master Castiel, please," she starts, as they walk toward the village together. The little boy clenches to his mother's tail of shirt again.

Cas swallows, not meeting her eyes. "I'm sorry, I have to..."

"You will be killing me, you know that?" Rowena says, dropping the pleading tone. She has figured out their plan. "Me, and so many other women out here. Some of them don't even have magic to protect themselves."

Cas can't answer. Dean answers for him, "Blame that on me then. I'm the one asking him to do the damned thing. We have to save the world -- my world."

"So you'll watch *my* world and people like *me* burn, just because we are born three hundred years earlier than you. Great hero choice!" Rowena grits her teeth, snapping harshly.

"Dean, maybe we can still --" Cas starts.

"No, we can't." Dean already knows what he might be suggesting. Stash her somewhere, find some kind of loopholes in the timeline, trick the world and time and history, and pray it wouldn't bite them in the ass again. Which never comes as they wish. "We agreed. We're not killing them, we're just making sure they are as they were before. We're doing the right thing."

"Are we?"

Three hours later, they watch the villagers tie Rowena onto a burning hot pyre and start lighting the firewood. The villagers yell and sing with joy, shouting loudly "Witch" and throwing stones at her. Fergus hides behind a tree, crying.

Dean thinks he might know why Crowley is the way he is now. They might just created the King of the Hell themselves.

Cas turns his back to the scene, not wanting to watch anymore. Dean does the same after the first five minutes.

"This job, our souls, we're damned to Hell." Dean murmurs. He can still see the burning fire at the back of his eyes even if he's facing the crowd with his back.

Cas is holding back tears. "They are just humans, why are they even more cruel than demons?" he asks Dean.

Dean has no good answer.

"Humans are flawed." That's all he can say.

And that is only the beginning.

Rowena is hardly the most difficult to witness -- technically, since she *is* a witch, the villagers were at least not mistaken. But there are so many others that are not.

"That is the past me, saving them," Cas points to Dean, from a far side of the witch trial scene. Dean watches the past-Cas busily stashing innocent human women, hiding them from villagers. Some of them are girls so young barely coming of the age.

It does feel like committing murders now, just like Sam said. Dean thinks, biting his lips.

But then he remembers the explosions in his timeline, the global-wise purple-cloud explosions, shaking the ground, starting from Scotland. One way or another, whatever good they think the past-Cas did trying to help these women, it's breaking the reality apart in three hundred years. That's a good enough reason to sacrifice those women (who were already meant to be and already did sacrifice, if they didn't do anything in the first place).

It doesn't make the whole process any easier.

"Damn you!" One of the young girls curses loudly, when they have to let the villagers know her new hideout location, and she's dragged by two arms toward the pyre.

Another woman holds the hand of her little daughter. The villagers don't even spare the daughter, saying the moment they came into the village, the plague started.

So may times, they stop on their way, looking at each other in the eyes, asking silently, "Is this really the right thing to do?"

And at least one of them would have to tell the other, "Yes." It's something they *have to* do.

So they continue doing that, until the last woman past-Cas saved is condemned and burned again. The screaming when the flame licks onto her skin is a piercing pain, passing through their ears and reaching the depths of their brain. Dean thinks he can see blood on his hands never able to be washed away ever since.

"Is this what it's like, to be an angel? Watching over human from above, and never allowed to save them, even if you could or wanted?" Dean asks, as they walk out of Scotland on foot, just to stretch the moment, to let their heads cool down by the highland wind.

"For two thousand years I watched the Earth, we're not allowed to come down to the ground, or to make any interference. Not that I ever thought about doing so," Cas answers quietly. "That changed after we met."

Dean smiles bitterly. "And it's not making things any easier, isn't it?"

"No," Cas agrees, turning his head slightly, looking at Dean's side. But he doesn't elaborate.

And Dean thinks he can start to understand now. He imagines an angel sitting on the edge of the cloud, looking down at the earth. For thousands of years Cas would just watch, and now, for the first time, he's walking among them. How can it possibly *not* be confusing and easy to make mistakes? How can they even remotely expect him to act the same way humans would do, making the same choices, the "right" choices as they'd make, in the difficult times? And yet, Cas is here, walking alongside him, keeping him company, making moves together with him. What more can he ask?

Dean glances at Cas, running into Cas's eyes. And he says, quiet and sincere, "I'm so sorry, Cas." and, "Thank you."

He doesn't explain why.

But he thinks Cas understand.

Because the angel has a tiniest curl on the tip of his lips. And Dean doesn't miss it.

<br>

#### draft notes

witness witch trial, normal human cruelty, can't save them even if they want, even if he knows some of them are innocent, can't change history, they *have to* die; Dean starts understand Cas's dilemma in human history, but this is only the beginning

medieval, witch trial, save a poor women (but actually real witch) ← was to meet a witch promised to give him peace but persecuted shortly, Canisbay Scotland, 1668 summer with a 7y old boy, turn out to be Rowena&Fergus MacLeod, peasant, daughter of tanner (fly away because of the violence & conflict)

Rowena: self-loathing, newly deserted by the rich man going back to his rich wife, feel weak, "if I don't hate you, I would love you", not cruel yet but angry, hatred of the world bc cruelty, b. 1640, now 28y, Fergus 7y; Cas ≈ Oskar to her for now, be kind to her, but can't change anything fundamentally

consequence if not fix: witch running around in Scotland, cursing people through all history

### Chap. 7 Pompeii, 79 AD (2,000 years ago)

> (Dean POV) trace back: take Caecilius back to Pompeii, witness eruption, can't save everyone, can't save anyone

If taking a few women to their misery fate is something terrible enough to cast his soul to the Hell, then condemning a whole city must be something that keeps his soul in the Lowest Pit for eternity. Dean thinks, can't help grimacing.

"No, it wouldn't." Cas interrupts his thoughts. "It's the right thing to do."

Dean nods. They have to keep repeating it until they actually believe it. Why does he still feels like shit if that's true? Even when it's *his* idea?

They take Caecilius and his family back to the doomed city in the Eruption Day.

"I thought you said the Mount Vesuvius is going to erupt today," the man asks in a panic the moment he realizes where they're sent back to.

His house is decorated with jewelry collections and elegant sculptures, but none of the fortune is going to save him today.

"I thought you are an angel!" the daughter cries, begging at Cas's feet. "Please, save us. I know what's coming, I don't want to die."

Cas looks at Dean helplessly.

"I'm sorry," Dean tells the family, "I'm truly sorry. But it's just fate. It's history. It already happened."

"Not to us, not yet," the mother says, holding her daughter.

"I'm sorry," Dean says again, feeling the words weaker by every time he repeats it. And he's said it a lot today. He might have to say it more.

He has to find enough courage to walk out on the family, shutting their pleading eyes behind his back. Cas isn't taking it any easier than him. His jaw is tightened, the lines around his eyes crinkled, his gaze locked on the smoking mountain not far from the city. From where they stand on the street, the Mount Vesuvius looks like nothing more than a quiet sleeping creature, snorting white smoke occasionally from its nozzle. It might be giving signs, but not enough to alarm the local people to evacuate. The street is busy with normal mundane lives, people walking around chatting, stalls selling fruits and clothes. Just a peaceful little village on the fringe of disappearing.

"What did you do to save them last time?" Dean asks quietly. Too defeated to gather any more strength to speak any louder. "Fly all of them out of city?"

"I stopped the volcano from erupting." Cas looks at the mountain.

"You can do that?" Dean doesn't know if he should feel awed or intimidated.

"It's like redirecting a riverway, leading the water elsewhere." Cas flies them closer to the volcano, pointing at the dark red color under the rock. It's like watching blood pumping in a human's veins. "Releasing the pressure slowly, leading the lava through the earth's crust, then the Mount Vesuvius would never be active."

Dean closes his eyes and takes a long breath. "And now we have to re-erupt it and bury the city. It's like Sodom and Gomorrah..." He lets the breath out slowly. "Do it, Cas."

It's even more cruel than the witch trials.

They might be able to have some self-comfort that there are some evil witches that can be removed from the history during the trials. But burning a whole city -- this is nothing about good and evil. It's just fate and history now.

Dean reminds himself of that day when he wore Death's Ring for a day. He feels like this is that day again.

"Are you sure?" Cas asks, hesitant. "There are twenty thousand people."

"Yes," Dean tells him through gritted teeth. If he's asked again, he's afraid he might change the answer.

They watch the eruption from the high ground on the other side of the city. Ash of the volcano covers the sky, lava pouring into the city. People cry for help and horrified by the divine fury, and Dean and Cas stand there in utter silence, knowing it's not divine fury, it's just their doing.

"This is the second time I watch this happen," Cas says slowly, turning his eyes away from the ruined city below. "And I've never felt worse in millenniums. I hate to see that we can't save everyone -- we can't save *anyone*." He kneels down on the ground, looking like a lost child. "What's the point of having all the power and free wills but can't save them?"

Dean wants to say he feels the same, but words choke in his throat around the lump there.

"But there is still one thing I'm glad about," Cas continues, still slowly, voice low.

Dean glances at him, eyes questioning.

"That I don't have to do it alone. It almost feels like you're here watching the Earth with me from the beginning," he says quietly. "It makes things easier to bear, even just a little bit."

The image in Dean's mind shifts to two angels sitting at the edge of the cloud, side by side, looking down at the Earth together. The Earth is having burning flames and smoke rising from a corner on the north side, and they are just sitting there, watching. One of them has dazzling blue eyes, and the other, green.

He sudden feels old. Now he starts to understand when Cas occasionally slipped a line like "I'm millions of years old, Dean." It's not about the years he has spent, Dean realizes. It's about how much he has seen, how much he has experienced. And right now, standing by Cas's side, he feels as though he's experiencing everything Cas's been through, and his mind is aging just as Cas did -- ancient, and tired.

He starts to understand so much now. All those things he never really think deep enough about Cas -- that he's an angel, that he's so very old, and so very lonely.

But how can he ever really understand a being like Cas? Being only just a mortal, a human, looking up at an angel?

Dean manages to nod, and he tells Cas, "I'm glad to be here, too."

<br>

#### draft notes

Pompeii, stop the volcano, same the twenty thousand people, consequence? history of Italy changed, culture development unbalanced? ← (short, in passing line) "I was in here and here and here", one of time/place: Mount Vesuvius, 79 AD eruption day Aug 24 ("the word 'volcano' wasn't invented until that day")(year of "Consulhood of Vespasian and Titus")

characters: Caecilius (banker, marble trader), Metella, Evelina, Quintus

Consequence if not fix: Pompeii still exists, just a normal, kinetic, lively town in Italy, but too many people → social, cultural problem? social instability?

### Chap. 8 From Ice Age to Age of Fishes

> trace back, fast forward: homo sapiens vs Neanderthals, what does "human" mean
>
> asteroid & dinosaur extinction, can't save every life, normal nature cruelty & nature rule
>
> the first fish, normal nature kindness & what does "life" mean
>
> formation of Earth, watch star together, the beginning of the world → Cas doesn't want to break the star, but has to, what does "choice" mean, they make the asteroid belt together, basically affect the universe, Dean realize the broader view, not limited ever again

**Europe, Ice Age (40,000 years ago)**

Cas is right about their music and poetry. The Neanderthals. Dean thinks, watching those ancient human ancestors dancing around the fire in the last cave in the Ice Age.

"They are not really human yet," Cas tells him quietly. "And they never will. They'll never survive the Ice Age, and the skeletons and those mural paintings will be the only traces the modern humans piece together their existence."

"But you rooted for them? You came back 40 thousand years to save them," Dean says, voice neutral, not anywhere close to accusing. Just asking. Just listening.

"It's a whole human race. I couldn't bear to see them disappear. All those art and thoughts and lives, they'll never appear again anywhere else. You people, the Homo Sapien Sapiens never have anything similar." Cas watches them with a small tender smile like a mother watching a child, a gardener watching a flower in his garden. Dean notices it, and finds it familiar.

"Does that mean I'd have four fingers and four toes if we're descendants of them?" Dean tries to ease the mood, can't help wondering aloud. "I bet I won't look as good as I am now, innit?"

Cas glances at him with that small smile still hanging on the tip of his mouth. "I think you'll still look as beautiful as you are," he says honestly.

Dean can't stop his cheeks from burning. "You don't just say shit like that," he mumbles, turning back to those ancient creatures -- humans, they're technically humans, he has to remind himself.

It is funny to watch those primitive humans, really. It's almost surreal. They look almost like real humans, but the furs and the sound they make to communicate, they seem to be still on the spectrum of creatures. Looking at them as almost like looking at a mirror, and be reminded they are nothing more than a few primitive creatures, only evolved a few thousand years and getting rid of the hairs along the way.

Now that he thinks, all those times those other rude angels calling them "hairless ape"; from their point of view, it really isn't too wrong. Which makes Cas such a weird exception then. Knowing what they, seeing where they come from, and still willing to spend time with them, help them, even now, still standing by his side as if they are equal. How come Cas never said anything like that before?

Dean glances at Cas. And unsurprised to find the angel is watching his face closely.

"What are you thinking?" Cas asks him.

"Nothing," Dean answers automatically, then rethinks his reply. "Just, how funny it is, seeing where we come from, and..." *and where you come from.* He glances at Cas, then at the sky, not finishing his sentence. *How fundamentally different we are. You're light, and I'm just... this.*

"You're not anything less because you're human." Cas understands him easy enough, and tells him solemnly. "In fact, you are so much more."

Dean huffs a small laugh, more bitter than humorous. "It's strange to even think about what does 'human' mean when you're looking at a group of ancient-human that's gonna extinct."

Cas hums softly, a little sad.

"I see why you want to save them now," Dean says then. Adding slowly, "And I'm sorry that we have to undo that."

"It's all just natural order, right?" Cas nods understandably.

They watch in silence as the ice collapses on the cave, and buries the last of the Neanderthals.

<br>

<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">
<br>
**Earth, Jurassic Epoch (66 million years ago)**

Dinosaurs do have furs. Dean watches with wide eyes.

"No wonder you always complain about *Jurassic Park* not being accurate enough," Dean amuses.

"I almost forget what they look like, too." Cas takes a few steps forward, crooking his neck to watch a gigantic Sauroposeidon biting leaves with huge interest, like a child looking at his favorite childhood toy, fascinated even after he's grown up. "I haven't seen them in millions of years."

By "millions of years," he does mean it literally, Dean realizes. Nothing exaggerated. Just 66 million years before their time. The Earth is covered with tall ferns and dinosaurs, the air rich with wet fresh rainforest moisture, he'd be in his widest dream to imagine a scene like this, and now he's right here.

"How did they die? All those mysteries about dinosaurs, all the theories about their extinctions, are any of them actually right?" Dean asks.

"Asteroid," Cas answers simply.

"Of course," Dean says, somewhat unsurprised. It's the most popular theory after all.

"And let me guess, the past-you takes that asteroid out of orbit to save them?"

Cas nods, eyes still lingering on the Sauroposeidon that's enjoying the leaves intently, a baby dinosaur playing round their feet. "You asked me to save lives, and I was trying to do exactly that. Are they not worth saving as much as humans? They're smart, they thrive on the Earth and cover every corner of the land, just like humans do. Why do they have to die?"

Dean follows his gaze, watching those creatures. He'll have to admit it never even really cross his mind -- guess it's just a bias as a human then, always by default prioritizing his own species on top of others. But for angels, all lives are just... lives. Not just "hairless apes" now, in angels' eyes, they must also appear no difference to a cat, a dog, an ant. So easy to ignore, so easy to squash. He wouldn't even blame other angels for thinking them as insects now. Yet Cas only looks at him like he is something precious, something valuable -- something, no, it's some*one* -- someone worth saving, even worth die trying. How does that even happen?

Turning his head, Dean realizes Cas is still waiting for his answer. "I don't know, Cas. The cruelty of the natural order, I guess." Dean manages to croak out. He can't find his voice as much as finding his self now. This trip, he really didn't expect it to be so mind-blowing and eye-opening. He feels small in a way he never knew before.

"Cas, tell me something," Dean hears himself saying. "Human race is just one race in all those creatures, and our lives are just small ones in the human race. Why do you even bother keep coming back to us, coming to save us?"

Cas turns fully to him now, eyes surprised by the question, the look of "why do you even have to ask." And after a beat, he answers, "Because you matter to me, Dean, because you're the only friend I have."

After a pause, Cas adds, "All lives are worth saving, and yours --" he makes sure Dean meets his eyes when he says it, "-- worth the world to *me*."

Dean swallows, not knowing what to say. In the end, he has to settle with a stuttering "Yours too, Cas, to me."

They watch the asteroid falling onto Earth after that. They can't do anything, but at least they can remember their last looks.

**Seashore, Age of Fishes (357 million years ago)**

"An older brother once told me, all those millions of years ago, 'Don't step on that fish, Castiel. Big plans for that fish.'" Cas leads the way on the seashore, kneeling down to point at a small grey fish as it heaves itself on the beach.

"An older brother?" Dean kneels down beside him. The fish looks nothing special, maybe except for the fact it's trying to move to the land.

"Gabriel." Cas tilts his head, remembering. "And I think he's the first one teaching me to see the wonder and beauty of the creations and lives."

"I'd never know that," Dean murmurs. Then, "And why are we here? The first little fish starts living on the land, that's good thing, right? Nothing to re-kill for once?"

"I'm afraid not." Cas walks down the beach. And there, a small red fish is also doing great in its process of moving onto land without suffocating. Beside it, a blue one. More fish are on their way to conquer the land, as it appears.

Dean stares at the angel beside him with a gaping mouth. "Holy, you did that?"

Cas lowers his head, "I was just thinking they should all at least have a chance, you know, living a different life, evolving into different forms..."

"That's like God-level power, changing the whole evolution!"

"Not God-level, just angel-level," Cas corrects him.

But still, affecting the whole evolution by something as small as pulling a little fish onto the shore -- Dean thinks his brain is buzzing with new realization now. How come he never realizes exactly how much power the angels really have?

They're powerful, they can fly, they can explode demons and monsters -- sure, those are the ones he's grown familiar with. And for bigger douchebags like Zachariah and Gabriel (when he's still Trickster), the list can add a few more items like reshaping the reality. But somehow, things like "affecting the entire evolution" has never been on the list in his mind, but apparently it's just a part of the package.

He eyes Cas, wondering not for the first time in this trip just how much Cas could do, exactly how powerful he is, and how much he doesn't know about him. All these years -- fours years now since he crawled out of that graveyard and ran into Cas in that barn -- all these time he thought he starts knowing Cas, yet sometimes he still thinks he might barely scratch the surface. He wonders if he'd ever really know Cas completely, entirely -- like Cas knows about him, like the way Cas can rebuild him from scratch. The thought makes his tongue taste bitter.

And Cas somehow knows what he's thinking. "Dean, you know me as much as any human ever could," he says quietly, almost like pleading.

"But is that all of you?" Dean can't help wondering aloud. He doesn't let his mind slip into the memory of the past year, but some thread of the bitter ones still slide in. He sees the pair of pained eyes in the reflection of holy fire.

Cas opens his mouth then pauses. *It is not,* Dean thinks bitterly. *And there is nothing he can do about it. Nothing either of them can do about it. It's just the way they are, angel and human. They're just, too different.*

Cas catches his hand and leads his palm onto his chest. He takes a breath in, then lets it out. Dean's hand rises and falls as his chest heaves and drops. His heart beats steadily under his fingers, just like any human, just like any life. Dean looks into those eyes, finding them bright yet pained, old yet hopeful. It is Cas, the angel who's willing to give him anything, who had fallen for him. What more can he ask?

"Yes," Cas finally speaks, "I'd like to think you already know everything about me, more than myself."

Dean pulls him over into a hug, just so he doesn't have to stand those eyes any longer, or he's afraid tears might pour out of his eyes. Yes, he thinks Cas might be right, he does know him -- he knows Cas wouldn't do anything to harm them purposefully, he knows Cas cares for him and for everything he cares, he knows ever since Cas pulled him out of the Hell, their lives are entangled together, and there is nothing they wouldn't do for each other. He knows he's never had anyone like Cas before in his life, and he never will have another one like him if he ever loses him. He remembers the damp trench coat stained with Cas's blood floating on the dirty water, and all those sleepless nights staring at the ceiling thinking Cas would never be back again.

Dean closes his eyes, feeling the warmth and solidness of Cas's body in his embrace, feeling Cas's hands tentatively reach behind him, rounding on his back, and finally putting his chins on his shoulder. The tight muscles in his body relax under the touch.

"Dean?" Cas asks quietly over his shoulder.

"Just, let me hold you for a little longer," Dean sniffs. "I missed you."

"I'm here," Cas answers him. "I'm not going anywhere."

"I know, I know." Dean swallows. "I'm just so glad I have you."

"You will always have me, Dean," Cas tells him.

And Dean smiles. He smiles like the sun rises on the Earth for the first time, and he is the first life on the Earth feeling its warmth on his face.

They spend the rest of the day throwing the other fish that shouldn't be there back into the sea, leaving only the little grey fish. They watch it climb and heave and struggle with its tiny fins like the first pair of legs of a land creature in comfortable silence.

<br>

**Words after chapter:** The part about Neanderthals is partially inspired by a small plot in *Everything Everywhere All at Once*.

#### draft notes

it's a war against natural order, not even fighting Death or God could compare to that. Natural Order isn't someone they can bargain with or find a loophole to escape, it just *is*. And the only thing they can do is obey.

the very early human evolution, the homo sapiens vs Neanderthals', enjoy the company with the very first few humans, relationship with Adam etc.? <u>watching bees nude</u> (natural science history vs religious history, how to merge?) ← accidentally affect human evolution, modern human has different features (write in a way that modern people don't realize weird things are weird because it changes the whole history, butterfly effect)

Consequence if not fix: both human species coexist and forever at war, Dean biologically look/sound differently

///

can't save every life, normal nature cruelty & nature rule

falling asteroid, dinosaur extinction, comment: "just like Sodom and Gomorrah", "I wasn't there" (because he actually was, suddenly remember?) ← real dinosaurs have furs

Consequence if not fix: dinosaur coexist with human

///

watch the fish, the first fish on the shore (S06E20 I remember being at a shoreline, watching a little grey fish heave itself up on the beach and an older brother saying, "don't step on that fish, Castiel. Big plans for that fish."), the first creature on the land ← help it? touch it? affect its evolution?

Cas try to help other fish that didn't make it to make it to the shore as well, which he shouldn't; so now in order to fix it, they'll have kill those other fish too, leaving only one to succeed

Consequence if not fix: other humanoid species existing along with normal human beings (e.g. fish-people, bird-people, lizard-people)



the first grey fish's name is Adam

Dean: No way, I'm pretty sure your book says Adam is a *man*

Cas: And what's the definition of a man?

Dean: (stare at Cas, shake hands, stare at fish again, still can't believe) You gotta be kidding me.

### Chap 9 Space, Hadean Eon (4.6 billion years ago)

> formation of stars, watch star together, the beginning of the world → Cas doesn't want to break the star, but has to, what does "choice" mean, they make the asteroid belt together, basically affect the universe, Dean realize the broader view, not limited ever again

Their last stop is in the space.

They float in the dark space, watching the planets and stars fly around them, some following trajectories, others seem to be just floating around. Dean doesn't ask how Cas manages his breathing problem in the space, figuring his angel mojo must have figured it all out.

"It's 4.6 billion years before your time," Cas looks at the planets before them, eyes sparkling with lights as bright as glittering stars in the distance. "We are still in the solar system."

"That must be the Earth." Dean spots the green-blue planet in some distance. It's like he's in a spaceship -- even better than that, he doesn't need to glance out from the tiny little goggle of a spacesuit to see. He's just floating in the space, looking at his home planet spinning slowly. There is something peaceful and calm about the whole thing. He never thought about actually looking at the "world" from outside all these times he's trying so hard to save it.

"Yes," Cas says quietly. "It's the most beautiful planet in the whole universe."

"Because it has life?" Dean asks casually.

"Because it has you," Cas answers naturally, like it's the most obvious fact.

Dean wets his lips automatically. He has to look away at some flying comets for a couple seconds before talking again, just so his voice wouldn't sound fluttered. He would never know how to answer to things like that, and there should be a rule to prohibit Cas from saying them all the time.

"Why are we here again?"

"I saved a planet that shouldn't be there -- Phaeton." Cas points at the planet between the Mars and Jupiter, voice stressed. "It should be the asteroid belt now, as the astronomers on Earth observe throughout the history. But Kepler was right all the time, it would have been here, if it doesn't explode."

Dean squints at the rocky planet spinning around the Sun, one Mars away from Earth. It looks... just like any planet he'd imagine, twice as big as Earth, flying in its orbit. It has an uneven surface, much like Moon, but so much bigger. The pits and mountains on it form a scenery as tremendous as the Grand Canyon, except the scale is thousands of times grander. It's a *planet*, for Christ's sake. Just like Earth. It's a whole *world* for any life living there -- if there is any.

"Is it going to have any life on there? After you saved it?" Dean asks, can't taking his eyes off that planet.

"Yes." Cas says, keeping his eyes trained on it just as intensely as Dean does, remembering its last looks as hard as they can. "In about a billion years, there will appear the first life form, much different from the ones on Earth, but they are lives. And from there, they evolve and thrive." His voice drops lower as he speaks, for both of them know the inevitable fate of that whole planet and all those lives.

Neither of them want to say it just yet. They watch it a while longer.

"It's going to fly into Earth in 4.6 billion years," Dean says instead, "killing all lives on both planets." That NASA announcement on the TV before they headed out finally makes senses. That news about Phaeton. So here's where it comes from.

Cas nods quietly, sad. "Yes."

Dean nods slowly beside him, not knowing what more to say. What could be said in the funeral of a whole planet? Where all the lives that could have existed on that planet now ever will? Where only the two of them witness it and know what could have happened, would have but never have a chance? He tries not to think about all the lives dying and disappearing on that planet, the way humans cry and perish when bombs drop on the ground. He has to remind himself there is a difference between dying and never been born.

He would never dream with his wildest imagination to expect this to be the day he's going to explode a whole planet -- not that he knew possible -- but here they are. How come their life always manage to find the most bewildered and unexpected challenge to throw on their way? What does it make him now? More than witch-killer, more than species-massacrer, and now star-destroyer? His brain supplies the image of Alderaan being exploded by the Death Star in *A New Hope*. Which makes them Darth Vader.

He has to pull his wandering mind back before it drifts too far away.

"It's a beautiful planet," Dean tells the angel, hoping at the very least he could make Cas feel a little better than he would be if alone, just to know there is someone else sees what he saw, and someone else understands. However little comfort he can offer, he's here with him. "I'm sorry it has to be gone."

"I'm glad it would mean Earth can be safe," Cas answers quietly, "that you can be safe."

They un-save the planet and watch Phaeton explode. The force is so strong that the comets flying too close to its core get pushed far out of the way. Dust and rocks scatter in the space, finding their own orbits to fly around the Sun. The asteroid belt starts taking its form. Even the Sun looks a degree dimmer losing a planet and all the potential lives that could have been there from its system.

Dean thinks it's only right to hold and squeeze Cas's hand at moment like this, so that's exactly what he does. Cas squeezes back thankfully.

"In the Greek mythology, Phaeton is the son of Helios, driving the chariot too unstably, burning and freezing the Earth, so Zeus kills him," Cas tells him, as the fragments of Phaeton fill in the gaps between Mars and Jupiter.

Dean hums softly, wondering if that makes them Zeus. Thinking they hold the power of god is unsettling. Thinking they use the power of un-make a planet is even more so.

"How do you feel?" In the background of all the debris and fragments of the planet flying past them, Dean turns to Cas, asking. He realizes he should have asked that question way, way earlier, before the little grey fish, before the dinosaur, before the Neanderthals. He should have asked that when he saw Cas again in that hospital ward. What was his mind occupied with at that time? Oh -- the Leviathans, he almost forgot. When a planet is exploding before your eyes, it turns out, it's so easy to forget problems like Leviathans, and remember what's more important.

And when the more important person is by his side, he even forgets that planet. Dean looks at Cas like he's the only thing -- only one -- matters in the whole universe, in this moment. Because he is.

"I should have asked it earlier," Dean hears himself saying. "How are you, really?"

Cas considers the problem carefully, as if it's the first time someone ever really asks him this question, and means to hear an honest, serious answer -- it might really be the first time.

"I'm a little sad, and still not fully well, you may say. But I'm recovering, I think." Cas uses the hand not held by Dean to gesture his head. "It's not easy, I was trying to tell you." He pauses and thinks, and Dean waits for him.

And Dean realizes, it's the longest time, the most patient time he ever gives Cas, after all that happened. He should have done that more often. So he's doing exactly that. He nods, letting Cas know he's listening, and this time, he really *is listening*.

"My mind, it's like a library after tornado. I have tried so hard to put them back together. It's taking me everything to be here." Cas smiles weakly. "You have no idea how long it took."

"How long it took?" Dean asks. It was a little less than two months since Cas took over Sam's brokenness, and a day or two since he woke up. But Cas's tone makes him think it sounds more than that, a lot more.

"Years, many centuries, I lost count." Cas tells him.

Dean inhales sharply, "How?"

"Do you remember that time, when you yelled at me in the hospital and I flew to the dayroom, and I told you I had been there for three weeks?"

"Trying not to." Dean remembers as clear as day just how angry he was at the time. He regrets nothing more about scaring Cas away now. "I'm sorry, I didn't --"

Cas gently stops his apology with his gesture. "It wasn't the first time I flew back in time," he continues. "Meg knew. She ran into me playing chess with that time-travelled version of myself. But I didn't tell her, that wasn't the first time either."

"You flew back years, even centuries," Dean murmurs in astonishment.

Cas nods. "I needed time to recover. And even in that state when I first woke up, I knew I'd need more time than we had to fix myself. We didn't have enough time in the current time, but I spent them in the past, to save *you* the time we would have needed."

"But you would be alone all those centuries." Dean closes his eyes, heart clenching, voice choking. He imagines a broken angel that Cas was, wandering in the century-old street, alone, in his hospital gown, not really have a clear enough mind, not have anyone to turn to if he needed help. But he went there, so he could save them the most precious time that they couldn't spare on him. He feels his chest too tight to breath, and it's the first time he's reminded he's in the vacuum in the space.

Cas manages another tight smile. "I think, part of me also didn't want you see me as I was, the broken beyond repair version of me, the one too insane to be of any use --" For the first time, he closes his eyes when he talks, because there is too much pain in it, and it makes Dean's heart bleeds. And Cas finishes the sentence: "-- because I wouldn't know what to do, if you find me like that, and look at me with disappointment in your eyes. I was afraid I might kill myself."

"Don't say that." Tears flood out of Dean's eyes, as much as Cas's.

Dean has to pull him into a hug as tight as he can offer, just to let his dumb angel know his feeling. "I would never --" he catches his breath, feeling their wet cheeks touching. "It's never about you being useful, Cas. Dammit, don't ever say that." He chokes on his tears, finding it so hard to form a complete sentence now, but he has to say it.

The debris of the planet floats around them, as broken as he thinks his heart is now. And he has to say it, or else he might never will.

"It's *you* that I need, Cas. Not how useful or powerful you are, not because you're an angel. Just you. Because, because --" he takes a long and shattered breath, "-- because I love you."

It doesn't sound real until the words leave his lips, and then it becomes the only truth of the universe. Floating with the fragments of the planet, scattering into the dust of the space.

Cas stills in his embrace. He pulls back slowly, with tears still hanging on his eyelashes. His eyes wide with disbelief and awe. He whispers, so carefully as if his breath could break the dream, as if he's afraid of waking up, "You love me?"

Dean wipes his tears away, so he can see Cas's face and those astonishingly blue eyes without water in his eyes. And he starts smiling, then the smile turns into a true-hearted laugh, then the laugh just doesn't stop. "Yes, Cas, I do. I really do. I don't know why it's taking all the dinosaurs and fish and an exploded planet for me to realize it, but yes, I do. God, I have no idea, but I don't think I even know how to live without you. Those past months, you have no idea."

Cas's lips tremble, and when he speaks, his voice is so in awe. And he tells Dean, "I love you, too, from the moment I saved you from the Hell. I realized that, because I love you more than the dinosaurs, more than the Neanderthals, and more than a whole planet. I'd destroy them to save you, to save the world you're in, like we just did, and I don't regret any of that."

There is nothing more to say after that. So Dean just holds the angel closer, feeling the synchronized heaves and falls of their chests against each other, feeling the vibration of their hearts under the skin and bone. So close, as if they are melting into each other's existence. Dean thinks, in a way, they already are.

The planets spin quietly around them. The Sun shines on them. It feels like the whole universe is just breathing peacefully with them now.

Dean exhales long and slow, finding his breath come out easily this time. So is Cas's.

<br>

#### draft notes

that destroyed planet's name: Phaeton

the formation of Earth, solar system, galaxy ← watch the space quietly, help create the stars, maybe this is when the asteroid belt was formed, should have been a star there, Cas break one when he's there this time, so now throughout the whole history, that planet doesn't exist (give that star a name and some feature? Diana (Artemis), from Roman history like the rest, or gods name from star name bc stars come first)

Consequence if not fix: gravity and orbit of Earth is changed, unstable environment for human living, human extinction/not evolved like this in the first place; new asteroid rain toward Earth bc no protection from asteroid belt, immediate end of world (=Earth) threat

Dean finally get to see the whole human and universe history together with Cas, in Cas's eyes, see a broader world view, how many human get to see human evolution and Earth's creation. Dean float in the space watching Earth forming for the first time, air and sea start to divide and shape, he's not looking at the universe, he's looking at Cas (≈ Good Omens S2, DW S01E02), realize more than ever how unhuman and human Cas is, in awe and feel pain. They fix timeline and go home together.

<u>he has spent way longer, but that time was folded</u>, he spent them in the past, saved them so much more time, so the current him that they meet is already a sane enough version, walking and talking, mostly functional, the best he can manage for himself to be presentable. <u>Even if broken, he wants them to meet the best version of him, he doesn't want them disappointed at him.</u>

### Chap. 10 Whitefish, Montana, 2012 (now)

> (Dean POV) go back to original timeline (May 18, 2012), still need to fix leviathan problem (mention why can't fix from changing past timeline), after all that, Cas willing to help, still slightly broken but a lot more mature and pull himself together (less child-like), Dean willing to be patient enough, ready to pull the big fight on leviathan and save the world together again. they have just see the beginning of the time and universe, what else can they be scared of

They come home together, finally.

It's still just the shabby hunter's cabin in the middle of nowhere of Whitefish, Montana. But it's home, with all of them back together, Sam included.

"Home sweet home," Dean sighs in a relief, rushing to drag his brother into a hug before he can protest.

Sam pats him on the back awkwardly, "Since when did you become a hugger?" He chuckles slightly.

"Shut up," Dean lets him go. "How long have we been gone?"

Sam checks his watch. "Three hours, give or take."

"Not bad," Dean glances at Cas, finding his attention attracted to the TV. The reporter is delivering a weather forecast. Not any breaking news this time. "Anything on TV?" he asks.

Cas shakes his head. "Everything is back to normal."

"And Leviathans?" Deans asks, rising his eyebrows with hope.

"Still out there," Cas tells him, almost apologetically.

Dean shrugs. "As good as where we started then."

Sam regards them. "Hello, Castiel," he greets the angel with a tight smile, then turns to Dean again, lowering his voice. "I see you found him, and I take it all those butterfly effects are back on track now?"

Dean smiles, a little more bright than he meant to be. "We have to explode a planet to do that, can you believe that? The view is spectacular. I'm sorry you missed that."

Sam rolls his eyes, "Sounds fun, but I'd rather *not* have to do anything like that."

Dean drops his smile, landing his gaze on Cas again. "You're right, hopefully not again."

Sam eyes them carefully. "There is something different with you two," he comments. "Is there anything I need to know?"

Dean drags his stare away and looks at his brother with the most innocent eyes. "No, nothing. Just that Cas and I have sorted out a few things, and now we are good."

Sam doesn't look convinced but he lets it slip. "Good," he says, sitting back at the desk where his laptop is, "now that we don't have a global witch problem, or a dinosaur problem, can we go back talk about how to handle the Leviathans?"

"And I'd like to help," Cas offers earnestly. "Whatever you need me for."

Dean looks at him, impressed. "What happened to the no-fight-and-no-conflict rule?"

"I am not as 'crazy' or 'broken' as before now," Cas uses his fingers to do the air quotes, Dean can't help chuckling. "And if our journey has taught me anything, there is nothing I wouldn't do for you. So, anything you need, just ask."

Dean blinks rapidly, glancing in Sam's direction only to find his brother pointedly raises an amused eyebrow that means "What did I say?" Dean mouths a "Shut up" as reply, and asks instead, "Sam, you find anything useful?"

Sam turns to his notebook, and starts: "So, get this -- 'Leviathan cannot be slain but by a bone of a righteous mortal washed in the three bloods of the fallen.' and 'Cut off the head, and the body will flounder.' So we might get a chance if..."

Sam goes on with the new plan he has in mind while they're away. Dean watches him talking with that new glint of hope in his eyes, and Cas, listening so attentively, glancing to meet his eyes once in a while to give him a reassuring small smile. It's just like all those other times, when they know they are in the last night before a big battle, when they are ready to pull a big fight and save the world together again, whatever the cost.

And Dean finds himself thinking: They weren't able to save all those people from Pompeii, or the dinosaurs, or the other fish -- they couldn't save all the lives from the past, they couldn't save a star from the beginning of time, but at least they can damn well try to save *this* world, at *this* time, with all the most important people in his life -- and that's exactly what they are going to do.

Dean sits down by the table, and tells them with a smile, "Let's do this."

Somehow, this time, he already knew they'd succeed.

<br>

**END**

#### draft notes

go back to the original timeline, still need to fix leviathan problem (can't fix it in the past bc Cas unleash them himself, fixed point, paradox), after all that, Cas willing to help, Dean willing to be patient enough to him, Cas's brokenness is fixed (go back to fit into S07E23 before finale)

they have just see the beginning of the time and universe, what else can they be afraid of

"All the creation accompanies death, all the extinction accompanies new life. That's the natural order. You can't save every single human being, you can't save all living life, you can't save a star." "But at least we can try. And we will." That's what Dean's made of. That's what Cas loves him for. That's what the two of them are going to do no matter what. That's the story of them.



match back to the beginning angst:

When Cas was broken, every time he ran away from a quarrel, like the first time in hospital, Dean worry he can be in any time anywhere, Meg says he's just in the dayroom. And we assumed he's just fly there, a displacement, not a temporal flight, but we are wrong, everyone's wrong. He flies to the past, and he's not flying back, he takes the long way, wait out for the time to pass slowly, until it come back to the current timeline, and meet Dean in the dayroom in the now time. He can be there for hours or even weeks already. He's an angel, <u>hundreds of thousands of years is a blink</u>. He plays games with himself, he calms himself down, ~~because he was trying to forget the reminded trauma about conflict (don't touch it)~~, knows he's safe because Dean wasn't there then, <u>so he won't be disturbed no matter what</u>, the perfect place (and time) to hide to. (slips how long he's been there, that's how Dean know)

That's how he calm himself back down, piece himself back together. He would have needed way longer to piece himself together, not just a night (8pm in the night, Meg called them in the morning), <u>he has spent way longer, but that time was folded</u>, he spent them in the past, saved them so much more time, so the current him that they meet is already a sane enough version, walking and talking, mostly functional, the best he can manage for himself to be presentable. <u>Even if broken, he wants them to meet the best version of him, he doesn't want them disappointed at him.</u>

Every time there is a quarrel and he flies back, he flies back further and waits out longer. The first few times are still the recent times when they are around him, hours, then years, then decades, centuries, millenniums, he goes back to history, then pre-history. He wants to help, to make the world a better place, to fix things from the root cause, since the very first time things went wrong, so he traces back time to change history
