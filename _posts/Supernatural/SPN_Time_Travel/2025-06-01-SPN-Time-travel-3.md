Dean does not expect to hear that sound of feathery wings again so soon. Some loose pages on the table fly to the floor.

He turns to look for Cas.

But there is no familiar color of the tan trench coat, except, right to his face, is a burning red color of a woman's long curly hair, holding the hand of an auburn-haired little boy. Looks like no more than ten years old.

He stares eyes to eyes with the woman for a moment, before snapping, "Who the hell are you?"

Glancing at the cabin's warding and not seeing any damage to them, he adds, "And how the hell did you get here?"

The thin young woman looks like shocked out of her mind, shivering like a leaf in winter. She answers with a really high-pitched voice and an authentic Scottish accent: "Where the bloody hell am I? And who the hell are *you*?!"

<br>

Ten minutes later, Sam manages to conjure up an old blanket from some corner and a glass of water.

Dean sits by the table -- the books are moved to the floor now, the table serving its real purpose for the moment -- watching the red-haired woman sipping the water.

"Now, talk." Dean tries very hard to not snap, but the days are wearing out his temper rapidly.

The woman shoots him a glare, frowning at the glass, "You don't have any whiskey or anything strong? What is this, not even tea? What are you, English?"

Dean rolls his eyes, "Americans!"

"That explains it," the woman twitches her lips, drinks some more water, and pushes the glass to the little boy. The boy grabs the glass with two chubby little hands.

"Why don't you start with a name?" Dean tries.

"Didn't you mom tell you never to give out your names or you will burn?" the woman mocks.

"New rule in America, what about staying all Riddler and you get shot?" Dean doesn't so much as to reach for his gun, merely glancing at the weapon stock hanging on the wall, figuring that should make the point clear enough.

"Dean!" Sam warns him, sitting down at the other side of the table, reaching out a hand to the red-haired woman, "Sorry about my brother's manner, we've been through a lot. So you've met my brother, Dean, and I'm Sam."

The red-haired woman shakes his hand, "Pleasure," she amuses, giving him a once-over with a tight smirk, "I like you more than your brother. You can call me 'Red' if you want, some villagers do that."

Dean exchanges a look with Sam meaning "That's obviously not her real name" and "Who wouldn't give their names? Bad guys", and Sam returns with a light shrug, meaning "I don't care, this is good enough. Go easy on her, Dean" and "Not everyone is a bad guy".

Dean turns his attention back to the red-haired woman. "Alright, *Red*," he presses on the name as if this can push her telling something she's been holding her tongue so tight about, "Why don't you share your side of the story, and we can decide what to do from there?"

The woman starts: "It is the year 1668 to me. Canisbay, Scotland is just on the edge of a sweet wee summer time..."

<hr>

It is the year 1668. Canisbay, Scotland is just on the edge of a sweet wee summer time.

That strange young man came into the village three days ago. The villagers didn't like him much, because he was just too strange -- even for us. He didn't talk much, he didn't walk around, he didn't eat or drink.

He just stood in the moor, watching the sheep and cattle. Some people thought he was up to no good and wanted to steal their beloved sheep and cattle.

I wasn't paying him much attention either, in the beginning.

I was frustrated, and thinking about some probably really bad ideas -- if you must know, I was thinking about how to revenge that heartless man and his rich wife.

When I was deep in thought, the little brat ran along again, like he always did, when I was doing my things. I probably should keep him chained like a dog just to be safe.

Anyway, he ran away, directly into the farm land where he really shouldn't go in. Cattles are like giant beasts to him, and he could so easily just get treaded like a shepherd's pie.

I was already thinking where to bury this little thing, when that man appeared before me, my boy in his arms. That was the first time I really look at him, and he had such blue eyes.

He said I should take better care of my boy, and I said thank you. My little thing said he ran there because he saw a pretty little flower, and this strange man just walked over to the flock, picked that most normal yellow whin from the moor and walked back. I had to invite him to tea after that.

"I'm here for the whins, too." he said when he sat down in my little hut. My boy was playing with the yellow flower, trying to eat it.

I was asking where he came from.

"Far away," that's what he said. He looked at me in a way even I felt bad for him. Those blue eyes, I think they were talking, more than he actually spoke. I asked him if he traveled a lot.

"Quite a lot lately, yes." he said with a smile. Such a gentle bright smile.

"You must miss home then, mister." I said.

"Castiel," he said, the smile turned a teeny little sad, but believe my eyes, I could tell. And then he said -- but I was sure that wasn't meant for me, he said, "Miss it, yes, but I don't think I'm welcomed here anymore."

"You're welcome to stay here, if it doesn't bore you." I told him. My humble little living place was just a barn no one wanted or looked. The village had a chapel and really not much going on -- not the best tourist spot.

"It's a lovely place," he said. His voice was so... in awe, I'm sure no one in history said that about Canisbay like he did ever before, not even the one built it.

"It has the most beautiful whins of all places, and this is the best summer of all the time." he said.

I had to admit I would never know what's the difference of those teeny tiny flowers had this year or last, but apparently someone has been keeping records for them.

"And the bees too." he added, then carried on talking about sheep and cattle and pasture, but that's when I started getting bored and stopped listening.

"As much as I'd love to be your company, mister," I told him, "I had work to do."

I didn't really have a "work" to do, but I consider my planning for the future an important task. And of course, I didn't want him stay long enough to notice my cauldron or grimoire.

He apologized and left.

At the sunset that day, when I walked past that field, he was still standing there, facing the west. The sheep and cattle had gone, I think he was just watching the color of the sun on the grass then.

I saw him again the next day but we didn't talk.

And the third day -- third time is the charm, isn't it -- I walked past him as I was tied backhanded, the villagers were cheering and waving torches.

Did I forget to mention, witch hunting was a really popular sport in the village? They just love to tie you up and roast you, and I guess this is just my day. Fergus cried so loud, but I asked him to shut up. This day would be the day that the world saw me as who I am, and for once, the villagers would be right on their judgement.

I don't blame them. They were quite right the cauldron wasn't for cooking soup for my boy's cold or the grimoire for just learning how to read.

The stake they tied me to was quite high and hot, and I was thinking should have wore the other black dress -- I wouldn't mind that one burnt, but this one, I liked this red one.

Then the fire started. The smoke was the first bothering thing. I couldn't breathe, let alone saying any spell. I was very busy cursing all of them. Fergus cried so loudly.

And then I saw that strange young man in the trench coat again -- Castiel stood in the crowd, far away at the edge, looking at me with his big sad eyes. I think those blue eyes lighted up somehow.

The next thing I know, I'm here, standing in the room, surrounded by two men interrogating me just like those bloody peasants.

It would be nice if mister Castiel could just explain what he'd done. If it was wizardry, it was far more powerful than I had ever known, and I'd really like to learn from the best.

<hr>

The woman licks her lips as she finishes. "Well?" She raises her eyebrows, "Are we done with the story-telling time?"

Dean swallows, looking down at the table.

Sam asks, "The kid, did you say his name is Fergus?"

"Aye," the red-haired woman replies easily.

Dean stiffens, "Please tell me the last name is not MacLeod."

"How do you know?" the woman eyes both of them carefully, pulling the boy closer to her, "Meet Fergus Roderick MacLeod."

"Hello," the boy waves at them shily.

"How old is he?"

"Seven after this fall."

"And you are?" Dean asks with a tight voice.

"Rowena MacLeod, at your service." The woman finally tells them.

Sam springs to his feet, gesturing to Dean, "Can I talk to you for a sec?" Right when Dean is also jumping to his feet.

"Yeah, just about to say the same."

<br>

"What the hell?"

"I know, right?"

"That's Crowley."

"When he's barely seven."

"What do we do about them?"

"Isn't that like the world's ultimate moral question: Can you kill baby Hitler when he was an infant if you can time travel?"

"Why would Cas even bring them here?"

"I don't know, maybe he's trying to help, like I asked him to, you know? Maybe he thought if we could figure out about them, we could change things."

"Or maybe he was just there watching the flowers and so happened ran into a witch hunt, and he was just trying to save some poor woman and her young kid, who turned out happened to be the future King of Hell."

"Yeah, or maybe that. And also, don't forget, the woman turned out to be a real witch."

"Where is he now?"

"How would I know?"

"Did you try to pray to him?"

"Dude, I'm probably the last person he wants to see now. He dropped them by without showing up a feather. Didn't you listen, she said he said he didn't think he'd be welcome here, and that's all on me."

"Then tell him he's wrong, and you're sorry."

Dean stares at Sam intensely, who stares him back with equal intensity.

Dean averts the look, checking back on the witch and the kid human Crowley. "But what do we do with them now?"

They are standing at the corner of the room, farthest to the table, but who knows if witch has the super ear, they lower their voice to barely a whisper for the heated discussion.

Sam follows his eyes, sighing. "I don't know. Feed them, I guess? Be good and kind to them so Crowley wouldn't turn out to be such a big dick?"

"You want to freaking raise the King of Hell?" Dean almost forgets to keep his voice low. Sam shushes him eagerly. "What, so that we can see the world change or his memory change in twenty years? Face the reality, Sam, we might not live another month with everything out there!"

"Or maybe ask for her help? A witch in our team gotta be better than nothing. Maybe there's a spell Cas knew that she knew and we could use."

Dean thinks about that. "Alright, you do that, talking to her, fathering the kid, I'll try Cas."

"Sounds like a plan." Sam nods.
