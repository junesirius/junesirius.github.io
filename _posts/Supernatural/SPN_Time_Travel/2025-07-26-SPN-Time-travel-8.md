**Europe, Ice Age (40,000 years ago)**

Cas is right about their music and poetry. The Neanderthals. Dean thinks, watching those ancient human ancestors dancing around the fire in the last cave in the Ice Age.

"They are not really human yet," Cas tells him quietly. "And they never will. They'll never survive the Ice Age, and the skeletons and those mural paintings will be the only traces the modern humans piece together their existence."

"But you rooted for them? You came back 40 thousand years to save them," Dean says, voice neutral, not anywhere close to accusing. Just asking. Just listening.

"It's a whole human race. I couldn't bear to see them disappear. All those arts and thoughts and lives, they'll never appear again anywhere else. You people, the Homo Sapien Sapiens never have anything similar." Cas watches them with a small tender smile like a mother watching a child, a gardener watching a flower in his garden. Dean notices it, and finds it familiar.

"Does that mean I'd have four fingers and four toes if we're descendants of them?" Dean tries to ease the mood, can't help wondering aloud. "I bet I won't look as good as I am now, innit?"

Cas glances at him with that small smile still hanging on the tip of his mouth. "I think you'll still look as beautiful as you are," he says honestly.

Dean can't stop his cheeks from burning. "You don't just say shit like that," he mumbles, turning back to those ancient creatures -- humans, they're technically humans, he has to remind himself.

It is funny to watch those primitive humans, really. It's almost surreal. They look almost like real humans, but the fur and the sound they make to communicate, they seem to be still on the spectrum of creatures. Looking at them is almost like looking at a mirror, and being reminded they are nothing more than a few primitive creatures, only evolved a few thousand years and getting rid of the hairs along the way.

Now that he thinks, all those times those other rude angels called them "hairless ape"; from their point of view, it really isn't too wrong. Which makes Cas such a weird exception then. Knowing what they are, seeing where they come from, and still willing to spend time with them, help them, even now, still standing by his side as if they are equal. How come Cas never said anything like that before?

Dean glances at Cas. And unsurprised to find the angel is watching his face closely.

"What are you thinking?" Cas asks him.

"Nothing," Dean answers automatically, then rethinks his reply. "Just, how funny it is, seeing where we come from, and..." *and where you come from.* He glances at Cas, then at the sky, not finishing his sentence. *How fundamentally different we are. You're light, and I'm just... this.*

"You're not anything less because you're human." Cas understands him easily enough, and tells him solemnly. "In fact, you are so much more."

Dean huffs a small laugh, more bitter than humorous. "It's strange to even think about what does 'human' mean when you're looking at a group of ancient humans that's gonna extinct."

Cas hums softly, a little sad.

"I see why you want to save them now," Dean says then. Adding slowly, "And I'm sorry that we have to undo that."

"It's all just natural order, right?" Cas nods understandably.

They watch in silence as the ice collapses on the cave, and buries the last of the Neanderthals.

**Earth, Jurassic Epoch (66 million years ago)**

Dinosaurs do have fur. Dean watches with wide eyes.

"No wonder you always complain about *Jurassic Park* not being accurate enough," Dean amuses.

"I almost forget what they look like, too." Cas takes a few steps forward, crooking his neck to watch a gigantic Sauroposeidon biting leaves with huge interest, like a child looking at his favorite childhood toy, fascinated even after he's grown up. "I haven't seen them in millions of years."

By "millions of years," he does mean it literally, Dean realizes. Nothing exaggerated. Just 66 million years before their time. The Earth is covered with tall ferns and dinosaurs, the air rich with wet fresh rainforest moisture; he'd be in his widest dream to imagine a scene like this, and now he's right here.

"How did they die? All those mysteries about dinosaurs, all the theories about their extinctions, are any of them actually right?" Dean asks.

"Asteroid," Cas answers simply.

"Of course," Dean says, somewhat unsurprised. It's the most popular theory after all.

"And let me guess, the past-you takes that asteroid out of orbit to save them?"

Cas nods, eyes still lingering on the Sauroposeidon that's enjoying the leaves intently, a baby dinosaur playing around their feet. "You asked me to save lives, and I was trying to do exactly that. Are they not worth saving as much as humans? They're smart, they thrive on the Earth and cover every corner of the land, just like humans do. Why do they have to die?"

Dean follows his gaze, watching those creatures. He'll have to admit it never even really crossed his mind -- guess it's just a bias as a human then, always by default prioritizing his own species on top of others. But for angels, all lives are just... lives. Not just "hairless apes" now, in angels' eyes, they must also appear no different to a cat, a dog, an ant. So easy to ignore, so easy to squash. He wouldn't even blame other angels for thinking of them as insects now. Yet Cas only looks at him like he is something precious, something valuable -- something, no, it's some*one* -- someone worth saving, even worth dying trying. How does that even happen?

Turning his head, Dean realizes Cas is still waiting for his answer. "I don't know, Cas. The cruelty of the natural order, I guess." Dean manages to croak out. He can't find his voice as much as finding his self now. This trip, he really didn't expect it to be so mind-blowing and eye-opening. He feels small in a way he never knew before.

"Cas, tell me something," Dean hears himself saying. "The human race is just one race in all those creatures, and our lives are just small ones in the human race. Why do you even bother coming back to us, coming to save us?"

Cas turns fully to him now, eyes surprised by the question, the look of "why do you even have to ask." And after a beat, he answers, "Because you matter to me, Dean, because you're the only friend I have."

After a pause, Cas adds, "All lives are worth saving, and yours --" he makes sure Dean meets his eyes when he says it, "-- worth the world to *me*."

Dean swallows, not knowing what to say. In the end, he has to settle with a stuttering "Yours too, Cas, to me."

They watch the asteroid falling onto Earth after that. They can't do anything, but at least they can remember their last looks.

**Seashore, Age of Fishes (357 million years ago)**

"An older brother once told me, all those millions of years ago, 'Don't step on that fish, Castiel. Big plans for that fish.'" Cas leads the way on the seashore, kneeling down to point at a small grey fish as it heaves itself on the beach.

"An older brother?" Dean kneels down beside him. The fish looks nothing special, maybe except for the fact it's trying to move to the land.

"Gabriel." Cas tilts his head, remembering. "And I think he's the first one teaching me to see the wonder and beauty of the creations and lives."

"I'd never know that," Dean murmurs. Then, "And why are we here? The first little fish starts living on the land, that's a good thing, right? Nothing to re-kill for once?"

"I'm afraid not." Cas walks down the beach. And there, a small red fish is also doing great in its process of moving onto land without suffocating. Beside it, a blue one. More fish are on their way to conquer the land, as it appears.

Dean stares at the angel beside him with a gaping mouth. "Holy, you did that?"

Cas lowers his head, "I was just thinking they should all at least have a chance, you know, living a different life, evolving into different forms..."

"That's like God-level power, changing the whole evolution!"

"Not God-level, just angel-level," Cas corrects him.

But still, affecting the whole evolution by something as small as pulling a little fish onto the shore -- Dean thinks his brain is buzzing with new realization now. How come he never realizes exactly how much power the angels really have?

They're powerful, they can fly, they can explode demons and monsters -- sure, those are the ones he's grown familiar with. And for bigger douchebags like Zachariah and Gabriel (when he's still Trickster), the list can add a few more items like reshaping reality. But somehow, things like "affecting the entire evolution" have never been on the list in his mind, but apparently it's just a part of the package.

He eyes Cas, wondering not for the first time in this trip just how much Cas could do, exactly how powerful he is, and how much he doesn't know about him. All these years -- four years now since he crawled out of that graveyard and ran into Cas in that barn -- all this time he thought he was starting to know Cas, yet sometimes he still thinks he might barely scratch the surface. He wonders if he'd ever really know Cas completely, entirely -- like Cas knows about him, like the way Cas can rebuild him from scratch. The thought makes his tongue taste bitter.

And Cas somehow knows what he's thinking. "Dean, you know me as much as any human ever could," he says quietly, almost like pleading.

"But is that all of you?" Dean can't help wondering aloud. He doesn't let his mind slip into the memory of the past year, but some thread of the bitter ones still slides in. He sees the pair of pained eyes in the reflection of holy fire.

Cas opens his mouth, then pauses. *It is not,* Dean thinks bitterly. *And there is nothing he can do about it. Nothing either of them can do about it. It's just the way they are, angel and human. They're just, too different.*

Cas catches his hand and leads his palm to place on his chest. He takes a breath in, then lets it out. Dean's hand rises and falls as his chest heaves and drops. His heart beats steadily under his fingers, just like any human, just like any life. Dean looks into those eyes, finding them bright yet pained, old yet hopeful. It is Cas, the angel who's willing to give him anything, who has fallen for him. What more can he ask?

"Yes," Cas finally speaks, "I'd like to think you already know everything about me, more than myself."

Dean pulls him over into a hug, just so he doesn't have to stand those eyes any longer, or he's afraid tears might pour out of his eyes. Yes, he thinks Cas might be right, he does know him -- he knows Cas wouldn't do anything to harm them purposefully, he knows Cas cares for him and for everything he cares, he knows ever since Cas pulled him out of the Hell, their lives are entangled together, and there is nothing they wouldn't do for each other. He knows he's never had anyone like Cas before in his life, and he never will have another one like him if he ever loses him. He remembers the damp trench coat stained with Cas's blood floating on the dirty water, and all those sleepless nights staring at the ceiling thinking Cas would never be back again.

Dean closes his eyes, feeling the warmth and solidness of Cas's body in his embrace, feeling Cas's hands tentatively reach behind him, rounding on his back, and finally putting his chin on his shoulder. The tight muscles in his body relax under the touch.

"Dean?" Cas asks quietly over his shoulder.

"Just, let me hold you for a little longer," Dean sniffs. "I missed you."

"I'm here," Cas answers him. "I'm not going anywhere."

"I know, I know." Dean swallows. "I'm just so glad I have you."

"You will always have me, Dean," Cas tells him.

And Dean smiles. He smiles like the sun rises on the Earth for the first time, and he is the first life on the Earth feeling its warmth on his face.

They spend the rest of the day throwing the other fish that shouldn't be there back into the sea, leaving only the little grey fish. They watch it climb and heave and struggle with its tiny fins like the first pair of legs of a land creature in comfortable silence.
