When he wakes up, it is dark outside.

It is at night, and he is on the planet Earth. Lying on a soft surface.

Castiel does not open his eyes for a few minutes. Letting the surrounding settling down on him slowly, like nights falling on the Earth.

He does not need to open his eyes to see.

The air smells sharp with disinfectant and cleaning odors, with a touch of fragrance. The chemicals floating in the air along with dust and pollens.

The window has a slit opening, the night breeze fluttering inside like the breath of a ghost.

Castiel sits up slowly.

"What is that sound?" He asks. The voice comes out of his throat is a human language. He remembers he's in a vessel.

"The thunder, you mean?" A female answers him, from a chair sitting left of his bed.

The figure sits on that chair is a shadow of shape, residing inside another vessel. A demon, he recognizes. Then he remembers her name.

Castiel does not notice the thunder until this moment. The thunder and lightning outside the window is quite noticeable, now that he turns to the window. He does not know why he doesn't notice them earlier. There might be a rain coming down. The air smells fresh dirt -- petrichor.

"No, a bright 'ping,' like a lovely Christmas bell. It wakes me up." Castiel tells the demon with a smile. "You can't hear it, because you're not an angel."

Meg looks him up and down with cautious eyes, "Welcome back, Clarence."

Castiel examines his own hands, like they are something he's never seen before. "I haven't been to anywhere," he answers, then thinks for a moment, "but you're right, there are so many places I can go."

Meg frowns at him, "What do you mean? Where do you want to go?"

"Somewhere in the universe," Castiel tells her, considering, voice soft, "some time."

"Great, good as nothing." Meg puts down the magazine in her hands, turning on the bedside lamp, studying him closely. "Something different about you," she denotes, "how you feel? Everything alright? I need to make a phone call."

Castiel smiles wilder. "I've never been better," he announces, then holds out a finger, "Pull my finger."

Meg looks at his eyes, then his index finger, as if it's a bomb she needs to defuse. "What?"

"My finger," Castiel nods encouragingly, "pull it."

Meg touches his fingertip tentatively.

The bulb in the lamp explodes, shattering glass flying in all directions.

Castiel chuckles in the darkness. "Isn't it fun?" He says cheerfully.

Meg stares at him. "What the fuck, something is definitely wrong with you."

She fuddles to replace the bulb. The new light is bright orange, the color of sunset.

The corner of Castiel's lip drops slightly at the comment. "You cursed," he blinks.

Meg looks at him unbelievably, "Damn right I did, news flash, I'm a demon, I curse." She raises her voice, "What's your problem?"

Castiel takes a step back hurriedly, "Please don't be angry. I don't want to fight."

He disappears with the sound of wings fluttering.

"What the hell?" Meg stares at the empty room.

Meg finds him in the dayroom down the hall, two minutes later.

Castiel is in the middle of a chess game with himself, half the chess pieces from either sides taken from the board.

"What was that?" Meg approaches the two angels suspiciously. Neither of them look up from the game. One of them wears his favorite trench coat, the other in white hospital gown.

Meg knows Castiel's trench coat still hangs on the end of his bed.

"Do you know there is a game in 19th century, so famous that it's called 'Immortal Game.'" The Castiel in trench coat says, moving a bishop on the board.

"But the game isn't really immortal," the Castiel sitting opposite to him moves a knight in defense.

"No, I mean, WHAT?" Meg walks up to the table, staring at both of them. "Who are you?" Her fingers fumble to her back, clutching on a hidden angel blade.

"I'm Castiel." The angel in trench coat tells her plainly.

"And I'm Castiel." The other one says the same, with a warm smile, as if playing chess with oneself is the most normal thing in his life.

"Uh-hum." Meg doesn't loosen her angel blade, unconvinced.

"It's nice to be somewhere quiet," the trench coat Castiel says, "especially when Dean is angry."

Meg scrutinizes him carefully, and she points out the obvious slowly, "Dean is not here."

The trench coat Cas tells her, "He is -- or, he will be." He checks the clock on the day room wall. "In about twenty-four hours."
