They come home together, finally.

It's still just the shabby hunter's cabin in the middle of nowhere of Whitefish, Montana. But it's home, with all of them back together, Sam included.

"Home sweet home," Dean sighs in a relief, rushing to drag his brother into a hug before he can protest.

Sam pats him on the back awkwardly, "Since when did you become a hugger?" He chuckles slightly.

"Shut up," Dean lets him go. "How long have we been gone?"

Sam checks his watch. "Three hours, give or take."

"Not bad," Dean glances at Cas, finding his attention attracted to the TV. The reporter is delivering a weather forecast. Not any breaking news this time. "Anything on TV?" he asks.

Cas shakes his head. "Everything is back to normal."

"And Leviathans?" Deans asks, rising his eyebrows with hope.

"Still out there," Cas tells him, almost apologetically.

Dean shrugs. "As good as where we started then."

Sam regards them. "Hello, Castiel," he greets the angel with a tight smile, then turns to Dean again, lowering his voice. "I see you found him, and I take it all those butterfly effects are back on track now?"

Dean smiles, a little more bright than he meant to be. "We have to explode a planet to do that, can you believe that? The view is spectacular. I'm sorry you missed that."

Sam rolls his eyes, "Sounds fun, but I'd rather *not* have to do anything like that."

Dean drops his smile, landing his gaze on Cas again. "You're right, hopefully not again."

Sam eyes them carefully. "There is something different with you two," he comments. "Is there anything I need to know?"

Dean drags his stare away and looks at his brother with the most innocent eyes. "No, nothing. Just that Cas and I have sorted out a few things, and now we are good."

Sam doesn't look convinced but he lets it slip. "Good," he says, sitting back at the desk where his laptop is, "now that we don't have a global witch problem, or a dinosaur problem, can we go back talk about how to handle the Leviathans?"

"And I'd like to help," Cas offers earnestly. "Whatever you need me for."

Dean looks at him, impressed. "What happened to the no-fight-and-no-conflict rule?"

"I am not as 'crazy' or 'broken' as before now," Cas uses his fingers to do the air quotes, Dean can't help chuckling. "And if our journey has taught me anything, there is nothing I wouldn't do for you. So, anything you need, just ask."

Dean blinks rapidly, glancing in Sam's direction only to find his brother pointedly raises an amused eyebrow that means "What did I say?" Dean mouths a "Shut up" as reply, and asks instead, "Sam, you find anything useful?"

Sam turns to his notebook, and starts: "So, get this -- 'Leviathan cannot be slain but by a bone of a righteous mortal washed in the three bloods of the fallen.' and 'Cut off the head, and the body will flounder.' So we might get a chance if..."

Sam goes on with the new plan he has in mind while they're away. Dean watches him talking with that new glint of hope in his eyes, and Cas, listening so attentively, glancing to meet his eyes once in a while to give him a reassuring small smile. It's just like all those other times, when they know they are in the last night before a big battle, when they are ready to pull a big fight and save the world together again, whatever the cost.

And Dean finds himself thinking: They weren't able to save all those people from Pompeii, or the dinosaurs, or the other fish -- they couldn't save all the lives from the past, they couldn't save a star from the beginning of time, but at least they can damn well try to save *this* world, at *this* time, with all the most important people in his life -- and that's exactly what they are going to do.

Dean sits down by the table, and tells them with a smile, "Let's do this."

Somehow, this time, he already knew they'd succeed.

**Notes after chapter**:

I'll have to confess the story turns out a bit different from what I imagined in the first place. The ultimate scene I really wanted to write is the one they float in the space and watch the planet that shouldn't be there, and eventually have to explode it -- at least I got that part roughly right. But so many other things, those other past times they travel back to, they just turned out a bit different, it's hard to explain. I didn't really get to write as much about broken Cas as I planed as well, Dean's thoughts keep carry the story away, so I blame that on Dean.

But it's not Dean's fault to be taken away by all the things he gets to see and has to do. The beginning of the evolution, the extinction of species, the formation and destruction of planets. It's too big for human, too grand, too celestial, too cosmic, too angelic. I love seeing him awed, by the nature and world itself, and most of all, by Cas. He's reminded over and over again that even when Cas is broken, he's still an angel, magnificent and beautiful and powerful. And in this journey, he gets to experience all those with him, watching all the most human side and most celestial side of Cas, learning more about him by every stop, loving him by every minute. It's not even about love anymore, like he realized, everything is too mind-blowing and eye-opening to even think properly. I think he's not the only one who can't think properly because of how big these scenes are.

There is a small snippet in the outline I can't find a right place to put into the work, but it's a funny little one, so I'll just leave it here:

> Cas: That little grey fish, his name is actually Adam.
>
> Dean: Wait, *THE Adam*? No way, I'm pretty sure your book says Adam is a *man*.
>
> Cas: And what's the definition of a *man*?
>
> Dean: (stare at Cas, shake his head, stare at the fish again, still can't believe) You gotta be kidding me.
>
> Cas: (a tiny little smile)
