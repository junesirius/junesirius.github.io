(**Warning words before chapter:** canon-typical anger control issue, Dean isn't very friendly or patient with Cas, some part can be uncomfortable to read, heavy angst)

<br>

Dean lingers in the Impala a while too long before Sam urges him.

The hospital looks as shabby as when they left it be, with a broken angel inside.

Sam eyes his reluctant figure, "You ready?"

Dean swallows, shaking his head. "We raced all the way here and now I don't know." He grimaces, remembering how Sam looked like when Cas took over all the ugly and nasty hell leftovers, and the frightening look in his eyes when he glanced up at them the moment those venom sank in.

He's never going to be ready.

Dean walks into the angel's room with a pounding heart.

The room is dark, with only a dim light on the ceiling. Glass residues glitter on the floor.

Cas is in his old trench coat, standing straight, staring out of the window. Impala parks not far from that window.

"Hey, Cas." Dean breathes out his name, barely more than a whisper. He feels like wiping his eyes.

Cas turns to him, with a gentle smile. Not counting the hospital gown, he looks all good and familiar. Warm and peaceful. Happy, even.

"Outside today, in the garden, I followed a honeybee." he tells them, looking into Dean's eyes.

His voice is eager and cheerful, lost the low gravel tone he carried with for years. Almost like Jimmy's when Cas wasn't in him.

Dean studies the lines on his face, the smile on his cheeks, the crinkles at the corner of his eyes.

Those look all wrong. He looks all wrong.

Dean hates himself for thinking that, but the Cas standing before him, is not the Cas he knew -- not entirely, anyway. Almost like meeting the Cas in the Croatoan world, the one that was so broken and human. And here he is, once again.

But they have bigger things to worry about. They have a whole world crawling with monsters to save. Dean looks back in Cas's eyes, thinking, *They don't have time to take things slowly. They just don't have time.*

He hates himself for the thought anyway.

He doesn't even ask Cas how bad it is.

"Buck up, buddy, we need your help," Dean stuffs the tablet they found into Cas's hands. "Can you read it?"

Cas squints at the tablet like reading through old man's reading glasses, holding the tablet closer then farther. "'Tree'?"

He looks up at them like a child looking for praise of recognizing a new word. Dean and Sam just stare at him.

Cas turns back to the tablet. "'Horse'? 'Fiddler crab'? I don't know, I can't read it. It wasn't meant for angels."

"Then what are you doing? Playing word puzzle? Bullshitting craps?" Dean's patience is running thin. "We're running out of time here, Cas!"

Cas flinches, shoving the tablet back into Dean's hands, taking a step away from him, his head tilted low, eyes on the floor. "Please, there is no need for anger here, Dean."

Dean takes a step closer to him, narrowing their distance, standing in his personal space, "Oh, really? Because I shouldn't be angry that the world is ending, *again*? That there are monsters everywhere and this is all *your fault*? But then you just fucking died and got amnesia and then gone all wild, leaving *me* cleaning up your mess? Tell you what, Cas, why don't you go ahead clean up your own mess this time. Actually go save something, because I am so tired --"

"Dean..." Sam calls out behind him, in his usual peacemaker's tone. Dean ignores him.

Cas just stares at him three inches away with widened panicked eyes, like a cornered little creature. Wordless.

"You got anything to say about that?" Dean pushes down the bitter taste bubbling in his throat, doesn't give in.

Cas opens his mouth, but no sound comes out of it. He flashes him another alarmed look, then there is the sound of wings. The air stirs, and the angel is gone.

"Friggin' angels!" Dean doesn't hide his frustration, throwing his hands in the air, "He's like a child! Running away like that, where the hell did he go?"

"Dean, he can be anywhere." Sam says in a worried voice. "For all we know, he can be in any *time*."

Meg sighs, "He's down in the dayroom now. I guarantee it. And Dean? Try not to startle him, will ya?"

Dean shoots her a glare, "I'm not dead enough to let a demon tell me how to handle an angel."

He moves down the hallway.

<br>

The dayroom is at the end of the hall, far away from all the rooms. It has all the usual hospital look, white blue wallpaper with uglyass letters wishing you a good health and plastic chairs. The air smells disgustingly fresh with too much artificial fragrance to cover the possibly never-ending, distinctive stale smell of the death and sickness.

Cas sits straight at the chair at the far end of the room, near a window. His back to the door.

Dean takes a deep breath walking toward him.

There is a stack of board game boxes piling on the edge of the table. Cas sits with two hands under his chins, deep in thought.

"Hey," Dean regards him for a second, aims for a softer voice. But even he knows the echo of his yell is still lingering in the air. He can even hear them himself.

"Hello, Dean." Cas comes out of his meditation, looking almost cheerful to see him, as if he has forgotten everything harsh he just said. Is the angel extra forgiven these days or does he have a goldfish's memory now?

Dean swallows.

"Didn't mean to yell at you earlier," Dean mumbles quickly. He's not gonna apologize.

Cas just nods briefly.

"It's forgotten," he says, "It's been a while anyway."

"A while?" Dean frowns, "It's like two minutes ago."

"It's been weeks for me." Cas answers.

Slow understanding pieces the information back together.

"You flied back in time." Dean says with realization, "How long you've been sitting here?"

"About three weeks, I think." Cas thinks about it. "I went to play a chess with myself, and other games. I knew all the move I did, but it's still fun. It's quiet here, just me and myself."

Dean stares at him unbelievably, "Did you just fly back in time so you know I wouldn't find you there?"

Cas blinks rushedly, then, quietly, "No."

Dean sighs, "Can you stop being a child?" Cas tilts his head, Dean adds, "Please?"

Cas looks down at the center of the table.

"What I said just now -- weeks ago, whatever -- my points stand." Dean stares him down. "We could really use your help to take down the Leviathans."

"I don't fight anymore." Cas answers quietly, insistant, "I watch bees."

"God damn it, Cas, not a good time for retiring!" Dean is on the edge of snapping, "Do you remember what you did?"

Cas turns away, reaching out for a board game box, turning the title side to him. The box reads, "Sorry!"

Dean closes his eyes, taking a deep breath. He takes the game box away from Cas, setting it back on the table side, on top of a chess board.

"You don't get to say 'Sorry' after you slaughter countless people," he says in a cold voice, "You button up your coat and make amends. You try your best undo the damage, even if it costs you everything, at least you'd know you tried your best fixing it, not just hiding behind playing shitty games." He fixes Cas with a stare, "That's what a coward do. Tell me you're better than that."

Cas swallows, shifting his eyes onto the game box stack. And he says, "Would you like a different game?"

<br>

Dean wants to scream, he wants to bang his head on the wall until one of them cracks. He doesn't care which. As long as something to do, something to take them out of this stalemate silence.

They have come back to the shelter -- Rufus's cabin in Montana, the closest place they get to hide low and maybe call a base camp ever since Bobby's place got burned down. The broken angel is in the kitchen, washing plates. They get jack squat on how to end Dick and his monster army or save the world.

The restlessness in the room is suffocating.

How can Cas still work on things as mundane as "washing dishes"? Like he's totally a human, like they're just camping out in a cabin for fun?

Dean stares at his hunched back. Cas is wiping his hand on a washing cloth. Unbelievable.

Sam is rummaging through the books god knows however many times as if answers can just pop out of there by themselves from the texts they've read for tons of times already. Meg is... doing whatever demons do, Dean doesn't keep a tab.

Cas turns back from the kitchen sink, hands still drying a plate. "Do we need a cat?" he asks, eyes wide and innocent, "Doesn't this place feel one species short? Probably why it's so quiet all the time."

Anger swells in Dean's chests like a balloon.

"Would a cat help us kill Dick and save the world?" Dean hears himself asking. He feels a disapproval glare from Sam's direction, maybe Meg's too, he disregards them.

Cas turns back toward the sink, putting the clean plate down. "No," he mutters.

"Then why the hell do we care?" Dean stands up, walking in Cas's direction. Sam hesitates a step toward him, looks unsure of whether to stop him.

"I..." Cas throws a quick flapping look at his approaching figure, "I just thought..."

"You just thought what, Cas? That we can pretend nothing bad is happening, the world is not ending? That as long as you keep making us burgers and washing plates, everything will just be fine, we can just be a happy normal family forever?" Dean feels blood pumping into his head, the vein at his temples thudding with his words. There might be blood in his eyes too because the world looks extra red and burning to him. "Just tell me, what are you thinking, by not doing anything? Are things just gonna fix themselves? Or are you thinking we'll just magic things up at the last minute, like we always do? 'Cause you know what, I run out of ideas, we might as well just all sit around and wait for the world to end while watching some fucking TVs!"

Dean can't help himself, his fingers itching at punching something. He marches to the kitchen sink, Cas ducks to the corner of the room. Dean grabs the plate in the sink, throwing it at the wall with all his forces. "TELL ME!"

The ceramic plate shatters to pieces with a loud clash.

Cas disappears with a fluttering sound of the wings.

Dean glances around, not seeing him. "Typical." he mumbles, feeling even shittier than before.
