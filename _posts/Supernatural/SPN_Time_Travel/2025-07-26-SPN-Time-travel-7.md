If taking a few women to their misery fate is something terrible enough to cast his soul to the Hell, then condemning a whole city must be something that keeps his soul in the Lowest Pit for eternity. Dean thinks, can't help grimacing.

"No, it wouldn't." Cas interrupts his thoughts. "It's the right thing to do."

Dean nods. They have to keep repeating it until they actually believe it. Why does he still feels like shit if that's true? Even when it's *his* idea?

They take Caecilius and his family back to the doomed city in the Eruption Day.

"I thought you said the Mount Vesuvius is going to erupt today," the man asks in a panic the moment he realizes where they're sent back to.

His house is decorated with jewelry collections and elegant sculptures, but none of the fortune is going to save him today.

"I thought you are an angel!" the daughter cries, begging at Cas's feet. "Please, save us. I know what's coming, I don't want to die."

Cas looks at Dean helplessly.

"I'm sorry," Dean tells the family, "I'm truly sorry. But it's just fate. It's history. It already happened."

"Not to us, not yet," the mother says, holding her daughter.

"I'm sorry," Dean says again, feeling the words weaker by every time he repeats it. And he's said it a lot today. He might have to say it more.

He has to find enough courage to walk out on the family, shutting their pleading eyes behind his back. Cas isn't taking it any easier than him. His jaw is tightened, the lines around his eyes crinkled, his gaze locked on the smoking mountain not far from the city. From where they stand on the street, the Mount Vesuvius looks like nothing more than a quiet sleeping creature, snorting white smoke occasionally from its nozzle. It might be giving signs, but not enough to alarm the local people to evacuate. The street is busy with normal mundane lives, people walking around chatting, stalls selling fruits and clothes. Just a peaceful little village on the fringe of disappearing.

"What did you do to save them last time?" Dean asks quietly. Too defeated to gather any more strength to speak any louder. "Fly all of them out of city?"

"I stopped the volcano from erupting." Cas looks at the mountain.

"You can do that?" Dean doesn't know if he should feel awed or intimidated.

"It's like redirecting a riverway, leading the water elsewhere." Cas flies them closer to the volcano, pointing at the dark red color under the rock. It's like watching blood pumping in a human's veins. "Releasing the pressure slowly, leading the lava through the earth's crust, then the Mount Vesuvius would never be active."

Dean closes his eyes and takes a long breath. "And now we have to re-erupt it and bury the city. It's like Sodom and Gomorrah..." He lets the breath out slowly. "Do it, Cas."

It's even more cruel than the witch trials.

They might be able to have some self-comfort that there are some evil witches that can be removed from the history during the trials. But burning a whole city -- this is nothing about good and evil. It's just fate and history now.

Dean reminds himself of that day when he wore Death's Ring for a day. He feels like this is that day again.

"Are you sure?" Cas asks, hesitant. "There are twenty thousand people."

"Yes," Dean tells him through gritted teeth. If he's asked again, he's afraid he might change the answer.

They watch the eruption from the high ground on the other side of the city. Ash of the volcano covers the sky, lava pouring into the city. People cry for help and horrified by the divine fury, and Dean and Cas stand there in utter silence, knowing it's not divine fury, it's just their doing.

"This is the second time I watch this happen," Cas says slowly, turning his eyes away from the ruined city below. "And I've never felt worse in millenniums. I hate to see that we can't save everyone -- we can't save *anyone*." He kneels down on the ground, looking like a lost child. "What's the point of having all the power and free wills but can't save them?"

Dean wants to say he feels the same, but words choke in his throat around the lump there.

"But there is still one thing I'm glad about," Cas continues, still slowly, voice low.

Dean glances at him, eyes questioning.

"That I don't have to do it alone. It almost feels like you're here watching the Earth with me from the beginning," he says quietly. "It makes things easier to bear, even just a little bit."

The image in Dean's mind shifts to two angels sitting at the edge of the cloud, side by side, looking down at the Earth together. The Earth is having burning flames and smoke rising from a corner on the north side, and they are just sitting there, watching. One of them has dazzling blue eyes, and the other, green.

He sudden feels old. Now he starts to understand when Cas occasionally slipped a line like "I'm millions of years old, Dean." It's not about the years he has spent, Dean realizes. It's about how much he has seen, how much he has experienced. And right now, standing by Cas's side, he feels as though he's experiencing everything Cas's been through, and his mind is aging just as Cas did -- ancient, and tired.

He starts to understand so much now. All those things he never really think deep enough about Cas -- that he's an angel, that he's so very old, and so very lonely.

But how can he ever really understand a being like Cas? Being only just a mortal, a human, looking up at an angel?

Dean manages to nod, and he tells Cas, "I'm glad to be here, too."
