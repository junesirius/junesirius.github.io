Cas doesn't come immediately.

But he does come eventually, when the world is in the toilet.

The news on the TV long stopped making any sense. Archeologists, biologists, and astronomers are all twisting their minds about all the peculiar breaking news. After the report from Pompeii, there is a new one cutting in about dinosaurs escaped from zoos (which they all seem to remember all of a sudden dinosaurs are indeed common and normal to see nowadays). Then another one from NASA about asteroid rains' abnormality, and the star known as Phaeton is spinning off its orbits from between Mars and Jupiter, flying toward Earth, announcing an immediate end-of-world threat.

Dean turns off the TV when it starts talking about a potential war between some other humanoid species against us humans.

It's freaking butterfly effects all over the place.

What's the difference between the world ending because of one cause, versus there are probably five other different reasons it could end with? It must be how a doctor feels when they start treating a dying patient who's diagnosed with one deadly disease, only to find there are five other different deadly diseases hidden underneath.

The feeling is called: hopeless desperation.

"I'm going to sit in my car for a while," Dean tells Sam, already halfway walking out toward the door.

"Isn't it a little too busy for a break?" Sam looks up from his laptop.

"Don't think there's any difference." Dean answers, defeated. "Unless there's anything I can do about dinosaurs or asteroids, oh, and Leviathans -- which I don't think there is. So yeah, I'm just gonna sit in my car and listen to my cassette for a bit, and possibly take one last nap while the world ends."

He doesn't wait for Sam's answer to that.

And he does exactly what he said he would, sitting in the car, turning on the cassette tape, and resting his eyes for a moment. Just to pretend, in that simple moment, in his world inside his car, everything is fine and all the bad things are merely a nightmare.

That is when Castiel shows up.

The angel pops out of the thin air in the Impala's backseat, panting heavily and anxiously.

Dean snaps his eyes open, staring at the backseat from the rear mirror, then immediately turns around to stare at the angel in the eyes. "Cas!" he calls out. Joy and alarm each take half the weight in his voice.

Cas's eyes are wide with horror. He can't even form a full sentence for the first five minutes as he's breathing so violently.

Dean digs out a blanket from the Impala's truck and climbs into the back seat to wrap around the startling Cas.

Cas is somehow still in his hospital gown underneath the trench coat. He shakes his head at Dean, but Dean has no idea of the meaning.

"What's wrong, Cas? What happened?" Dean asks, more worried than at any time this year. "It's okay, you're okay now. You're safe." He wraps his arms around the blanket, keeping it tighter around Cas.

Cas looks nothing remotely like an all-powerful angel now, more like a freaked-out child, terrified of monsters in his closet and refusing to turn off the light in his room at night, or a patient shivering with disease, unable to control his body.

Dean wonders if it might be true, if he might indeed just be the combination of a terrified child and a patient who's not well enough. He reminds himself that the broken wall from Sam's head is still in Cas.

"I'm sorry, Dean, I'm so, so sorry." The minute Cas is able to speak again, apologies are the first thing coming out of his mouth.

Dean caresses his arm where the blanket covers. For some reason, he really doesn't want to know what Cas is apologizing for, but the reasonable mind also knows it must be important. He has never seen Cas frightened like this -- perhaps only that brief second when he took over Sam's brokenness and looked up at them with the red light crawling in his veins.

Dean sighs, feeling his gut twisted in all sorts of knots. He waits for another couple of minutes before asking, just needs that extra buffer to prepare himself: "What happened?"

Cas closes his eyes with a deep frown. For a moment, he looks so thin and tiny under that blanket. Dean is reminded of a little wounded bird he once found, on the roadside, crippled so badly, its wings broken, hanging pitifully behind its body. Dean tried to save it, but he was merely a boy back then, hardly knew anything about animal emergency procedures. The bird didn't survive long. But Dean would like to think it still found some comfort in the warmth of his palms instead of dying alone on the roadside, that got to mean something.

Now he thinks it might not make any difference. He still didn't save it, after all.

"Cas?" Dean croaks, waiting.

"I was trying to help," Cas whispers, voice hoarse with misery. "I only wanted to help, like you asked."

He opens his eyes. There are tears in those blue eyes, flooding out, dropping from the corner. "I wanted to help them, save them, like you did."

Dean swallows. His heart is being torn to pieces watching Cas like that. He asks quietly, "What did you do?"

"Those people were going to be burned to death, so I tried to get them out. And the ones going to be buried in ashes, I had to help them too." Cas's eyes wander from Dean's face to somewhere left of the car's window, casting to the space. "And then I remember so many others, so many deaths along the way during all those millions of years of watching. I never did anything when they died. They were so happy dancing around the fires and singing poetry."

"Who were?"

"Neanderthals," Cas answers reflexively. "And they, the dinosaurs, I mean, if we are to save lives, are they not worth saving? Do they deserve to be extinct all those millions of years ago? So I went back then, trying to help them too... And then I remember there was a planet eons ago, Phaeton, as young as Earth, as beautiful as Saturn. I should have saved it, but instead, I watched it explode. So I went back trying to correct that wrong too..."

His gaze shifts back onto Dean's face, more tears dropping. "But Dean, I think... I'm afraid I might have made everything even worse than before. I don't know what to do... I'm sorry --"

Dean closes his eyes, forcing his breath to come out slowly. He can still hear his heart pounding and blood rushing to his head, burning at the back of his brain.

He forces his voice gentle and kind when he starts talking again, slow and as patient as he can manage. "Okay, here's what we're gonna do --" He leaves a hand on Cas's shoulder, putting a reassuring weight there, hoping Cas can feel it. "-- We'll go back fixing everything you changed, one thing at a time, putting them back the way they were. You'll take me with you, no more flying around on your own, wherever you're going."

"But it can be dangerous..." Cas starts.

"All the more reasons to tag along." Dean manages to squeeze a light smile at him, a tired one, but a smile nonetheless. "Together, or not at all. You understand?"

Cas nods small. "Thank you, Dean," he murmurs in a small voice.

So it is settled.

<br>

(**After chapter notes**: I do realize there is another loophole that I can't find a neat way to fix within the length so we'll have to pretend it's not there: Whenever the history is changed in the past, their memory would have been modified to think that new reality is the normalcy without realizing anything strange, like the *Titanic* episode showed, so everything related to Pompeii should be a new normalcy, same with Neanderthals or dinosaurs situations. Then they wouldn't even know what the problem is to fix. In this version, I'm setting it as if the timeline is changed but at least Dean and Sam's memoried remained the same as previously -- feels it's easier to handle. Please indulge me to move on with this premise.)
