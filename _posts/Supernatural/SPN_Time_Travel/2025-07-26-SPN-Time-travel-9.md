Their last stop is in the space.

They float in the dark space, watching the planets and stars fly around them, some following trajectories, others seem to be just floating around. Dean doesn't ask how Cas manages his breathing problem in the space, figuring his angel mojo must have figured it all out.

"It's 4.6 billion years before your time," Cas looks at the planets before them, eyes sparkling with lights as bright as glittering stars in the distance. "We are still in the solar system."

"That must be the Earth." Dean spots the green-blue planet in some distance. It's like he's in a spaceship -- even better than that, he doesn't need to glance out from the tiny little goggle of a spacesuit to see. He's just floating in the space, looking at his home planet spinning slowly. There is something peaceful and calm about the whole thing. He never thought about actually looking at the "world" from outside all these times he's trying so hard to save it.

"Yes," Cas says quietly. "It's the most beautiful planet in the whole universe."

"Because it has life?" Dean asks casually.

"Because it has you," Cas answers naturally, like it's the most obvious fact.

Dean wets his lips automatically. He has to look away at some flying comets for a couple seconds before talking again, just so his voice wouldn't sound fluttered. He would never know how to answer to things like that, and there should be a rule to prohibit Cas from saying them all the time.

"Why are we here again?"

"I saved a planet that shouldn't be there -- Phaeton." Cas points at the planet between the Mars and Jupiter, voice stressed. "It should be the asteroid belt now, as the astronomers on Earth observe throughout the history. But Kepler was right all the time, it would have been here, if it doesn't explode."

Dean squints at the rocky planet spinning around the Sun, one Mars away from Earth. It looks... just like any planet he'd imagine, twice as big as Earth, flying in its orbit. It has an uneven surface, much like Moon, but so much bigger. The pits and mountains on it form a scenery as tremendous as the Grand Canyon, except the scale is thousands of times grander. It's a *planet*, for Christ's sake. Just like Earth. It's a whole *world* for any life living there -- if there is any.

"Is it going to have any life on there? After you saved it?" Dean asks, can't taking his eyes off that planet.

"Yes." Cas says, keeping his eyes trained on it just as intensely as Dean does, remembering its last looks as hard as they can. "In about a billion years, there will appear the first life form, much different from the ones on Earth, but they are lives. And from there, they evolve and thrive." His voice drops lower as he speaks, for both of them know the inevitable fate of that whole planet and all those lives.

Neither of them want to say it just yet. They watch it a while longer.

"It's going to fly into Earth in 4.6 billion years," Dean says instead, "killing all lives on both planets." That NASA announcement on the TV before they headed out finally makes senses. That news about Phaeton. So here's where it comes from.

Cas nods quietly, sad. "Yes."

Dean nods slowly beside him, not knowing what more to say. What could be said in the funeral of a whole planet? Where all the lives that could have existed on that planet now ever will? Where only the two of them witness it and know what could have happened, would have but never have a chance? He tries not to think about all the lives dying and disappearing on that planet, the way humans cry and perish when bombs drop on the ground. He has to remind himself there is a difference between dying and never been born.

He would never dream with his wildest imagination to expect this to be the day he's going to explode a whole planet -- not that he knew possible -- but here they are. How come their life always manage to find the most bewildered and unexpected challenge to throw on their way? What does it make him now? More than witch-killer, more than species-massacrer, and now star-destroyer? His brain supplies the image of Alderaan being exploded by the Death Star in *A New Hope*. Which makes them Darth Vader.

He has to pull his wandering mind back before it drifts too far away.

"It's a beautiful planet," Dean tells the angel, hoping at the very least he could make Cas feel a little better than he would be if alone, just to know there is someone else sees what he saw, and someone else understands. However little comfort he can offer, he's here with him. "I'm sorry it has to be gone."

"I'm glad it would mean Earth can be safe," Cas answers quietly, "that you can be safe."

They un-save the planet and watch Phaeton explode. The force is so strong that the comets flying too close to its core get pushed far out of the way. Dust and rocks scatter in the space, finding their own orbits to fly around the Sun. The asteroid belt starts taking its form. Even the Sun looks a degree dimmer losing a planet and all the potential lives that could have been there from its system.

Dean thinks it's only right to hold and squeeze Cas's hand at moment like this, so that's exactly what he does. Cas squeezes back thankfully.

"In the Greek mythology, Phaeton is the son of Helios, driving the chariot too unstably, burning and freezing the Earth, so Zeus kills him," Cas tells him, as the fragments of Phaeton fill in the gaps between Mars and Jupiter.

Dean hums softly, wondering if that makes them Zeus. Thinking they hold the power of god is unsettling. Thinking they use the power of un-make a planet is even more so.

"How do you feel?" In the background of all the debris and fragments of the planet flying past them, Dean turns to Cas, asking. He realizes he should have asked that question way, way earlier, before the little grey fish, before the dinosaur, before the Neanderthals. He should have asked that when he saw Cas again in that hospital ward. What was his mind occupied with at that time? Oh -- the Leviathans, he almost forgot. When a planet is exploding before your eyes, it turns out, it's so easy to forget problems like Leviathans, and remember what's more important.

And when the more important person is by his side, he even forgets that planet. Dean looks at Cas like he's the only thing -- only one -- matters in the whole universe, in this moment. Because he is.

"I should have asked it earlier," Dean hears himself saying. "How are you, really?"

Cas considers the problem carefully, as if it's the first time someone ever really asks him this question, and means to hear an honest, serious answer -- it might really be the first time.

"I'm a little sad, and still not fully well, you may say. But I'm recovering, I think." Cas uses the hand not held by Dean to gesture his head. "It's not easy, I was trying to tell you." He pauses and thinks, and Dean waits for him.

And Dean realizes, it's the longest time, the most patient time he ever gives Cas, after all that happened. He should have done that more often. So he's doing exactly that. He nods, letting Cas know he's listening, and this time, he really *is listening*.

"My mind, it's like a library after tornado. I have tried so hard to put them back together. It's taking me everything to be here." Cas smiles weakly. "You have no idea how long it took."

"How long it took?" Dean asks. It was a little less than two months since Cas took over Sam's brokenness, and a day or two since he woke up. But Cas's tone makes him think it sounds more than that, a lot more.

"Years, many centuries, I lost count." Cas tells him.

Dean inhales sharply, "How?"

"Do you remember that time, when you yelled at me in the hospital and I flew to the dayroom, and I told you I had been there for three weeks?"

"Trying not to." Dean remembers as clear as day just how angry he was at the time. He regrets nothing more about scaring Cas away now. "I'm sorry, I didn't --"

Cas gently stops his apology with his gesture. "It wasn't the first time I flew back in time," he continues. "Meg knew. She ran into me playing chess with that time-travelled version of myself. But I didn't tell her, that wasn't the first time either."

"You flew back years, even centuries," Dean murmurs in astonishment.

Cas nods. "I needed time to recover. And even in that state when I first woke up, I knew I'd need more time than we had to fix myself. We didn't have enough time in the current time, but I spent them in the past, to save *you* the time we would have needed."

"But you would be alone all those centuries." Dean closes his eyes, heart clenching, voice choking. He imagines a broken angel that Cas was, wandering in the century-old street, alone, in his hospital gown, not really have a clear enough mind, not have anyone to turn to if he needed help. But he went there, so he could save them the most precious time that they couldn't spare on him. He feels his chest too tight to breath, and it's the first time he's reminded he's in the vacuum in the space.

Cas manages another tight smile. "I think, part of me also didn't want you see me as I was, the broken beyond repair version of me, the one too insane to be of any use --" For the first time, he closes his eyes when he talks, because there is too much pain in it, and it makes Dean's heart bleeds. And Cas finishes the sentence: "-- because I wouldn't know what to do, if you find me like that, and look at me with disappointment in your eyes. I was afraid I might kill myself."

"Don't say that." Tears flood out of Dean's eyes, as much as Cas's.

Dean has to pull him into a hug as tight as he can offer, just to let his dumb angel know his feeling. "I would never --" he catches his breath, feeling their wet cheeks touching. "It's never about you being useful, Cas. Dammit, don't ever say that." He chokes on his tears, finding it so hard to form a complete sentence now, but he has to say it.

The debris of the planet floats around them, as broken as he thinks his heart is now. And he has to say it, or else he might never will.

"It's *you* that I need, Cas. Not how useful or powerful you are, not because you're an angel. Just you. Because, because --" he takes a long and shattered breath, "-- because I love you."

It doesn't sound real until the words leave his lips, and then it becomes the only truth of the universe. Floating with the fragments of the planet, scattering into the dust of the space.

Cas stills in his embrace. He pulls back slowly, with tears still hanging on his eyelashes. His eyes wide with disbelief and awe. He whispers, so carefully as if his breath could break the dream, as if he's afraid of waking up, "You love me?"

Dean wipes his tears away, so he can see Cas's face and those astonishingly blue eyes without water in his eyes. And he starts smiling, then the smile turns into a true-hearted laugh, then the laugh just doesn't stop. "Yes, Cas, I do. I really do. I don't know why it's taking all the dinosaurs and fish and an exploded planet for me to realize it, but yes, I do. God, I have no idea, but I don't think I even know how to live without you. Those past months, you have no idea."

Cas's lips tremble, and when he speaks, his voice is so in awe. And he tells Dean, "I love you, too, from the moment I saved you from the Hell. I realized that, because I love you more than the dinosaurs, more than the Neanderthals, and more than a whole planet. I'd destroy them to save you, to save the world you're in, like we just did, and I don't regret any of that."

There is nothing more to say after that. So Dean just holds the angel closer, feeling the synchronized heaves and falls of their chests against each other, feeling the vibration of their hearts under the skin and bone. So close, as if they are melting into each other's existence. Dean thinks, in a way, they already are.

The planets spin quietly around them. The Sun shines on them. It feels like the whole universe is just breathing peacefully with them now.

Dean exhales long and slow, finding his breath come out easily this time. So is Cas's.
