They drop by Rufus' cabin briefly first -- need to pick up two passengers from the past.

Dean gives Sam a quick debrief to catch up, while Cas goes to the young boy, lowering himself so he can look the kid in the eyes and talk to him at the same height.

"I'm so sorry," Dean hears Cas saying quietly to the human kid version of Crowley, wondering what Cas is sorry for him about. He turns his attention to his conversation with Sam after that.

"It's going to be like re-sinking the Titanic. You sure you can do that? It's not going to be easy." Sam warns him in a quiet voice.

"No one said anything about easy," Dean glances at Cas absentmindedly, "but it has to be done. We're just changing things to make them the same as before, not like killing more people."

"It might end up feeling so. You sure you don't want me to come along?"

"Nah, we still need someone at the home base. You know, sending home beacon or something."

"Pretty sure you made that one up."

"Just, stay here, keep an eye on those Pompeiians, keep researching on Leviathans. We might be back before we head out."

Sam raises an eyebrow.

Dean shrugs. "You know, the time travel stuff, we might come back early or something. *Prisoners of Azkaban* stuff --"

"I know it!" Sam beams slightly. "I know you watched it too!"

"Shut up," Dean starts walking away toward Cas. "But yeah, point stands. Let's go save the timeline."

He puts a hand on Cas's shoulder, "Whenever you're ready."

Cas nods at Rowena and Fergus. And that's their only cue of the flight taking off.

<br>

Dean still remembers his last trip to Scotland. Which so happened to be also something related to Crowley -- to dig his human remains up so that he'd return Bobby's soul. He'd never stop making mental connections between this land and Crowley ever.

Rowena doesn't seem delighted to be back here. Dean doesn't blame her. Who would ever want to come back to a place where all her neighbors would want to burn her alive?

"Master Castiel, please," she starts, as they walk toward the village together. The little boy clenches to his mother's tail of shirt again.

Cas swallows, not meeting her eyes. "I'm sorry, I have to..."

"You will be killing me, you know that?" Rowena says, dropping the pleading tone. She has figured out their plan. "Me, and so many other women out here. Some of them don't even have magic to protect themselves."

Cas can't answer. Dean answers for him, "Blame that on me then. I'm the one asking him to do the damned thing. We have to save the world -- my world."

"So you'll watch *my* world and people like *me* burn, just because we are born three hundred years earlier than you. Great hero choice!" Rowena grits her teeth, snapping harshly.

"Dean, maybe we can still --" Cas starts.

"No, we can't." Dean already knows what he might be suggesting. Stash her somewhere, find some kind of loopholes in the timeline, trick the world and time and history, and pray it wouldn't bite them in the ass again. Which never comes as they wish. "We agreed. We're not killing them, we're just making sure they are as they were before. We're doing the right thing."

"Are we?"

Three hours later, they watch the villagers tie Rowena onto a burning hot pyre and start lighting the firewood. The villagers yell and sing with joy, shouting loudly "Witch" and throwing stones at her. Fergus hides behind a tree, crying.

Dean thinks he might know why Crowley is the way he is now. They might have just created the King of Hell themselves.

Cas turns his back on the scene, not wanting to watch anymore. Dean does the same after the first five minutes.

"This job, our souls, we're damned to Hell." Dean murmurs. He can still see the burning fire in the back of his eyes even if he's facing the crowd with his back.

Cas is holding back tears. "They are just humans, why are they even more cruel than demons?" he asks Dean.

Dean has no good answer.

"Humans are flawed." That's all he can say.

And that is only the beginning.

Rowena is hardly the most difficult to witness -- technically, since she *is* a witch, the villagers were at least not mistaken. But there are so many others that are not.

"That is the past me, saving them," Cas points to Dean, from the far side of the witch trial scene. Dean watches the past-Cas busily stashing innocent human women, hiding them from the villagers. Some of them are girls so young barely coming of age.

It does feel like committing murders now, just like Sam said. Dean thinks, biting his lips.

But then he remembers the explosions in his timeline, the global purple-cloud explosions, shaking the ground, starting from Scotland. One way or another, whatever good they think the past-Cas did trying to help these women, it's breaking the reality apart in three hundred years. That's a good enough reason to sacrifice those women (who were already meant to be and already did sacrifice, if they didn't do anything in the first place).

It doesn't make the whole process any easier.

"Damn you!" One of the young girls curses loudly, when they have to let the villagers know her new hideout location, and she's dragged by two arms toward the pyre.

Another woman holds the hand of her little daughter. The villagers don't even spare the daughter, saying the moment they came into the village, the plague started.

So many times, they stop on their way, looking at each other in the eyes, asking silently, "Is this really the right thing to do?"

And at least one of them would have to tell the other, "Yes." It's something they *have to* do.

So they continue doing that, until the last woman past-Cas saved is condemned and burned again. The screaming when the flame licks onto her skin is a piercing pain, passing through their ears and reaching the depths of their brain. Dean thinks he can see blood on his hands never able to be washed away ever since.

"Is this what it's like, to be an angel? Watching over humans from above, and never allowed to save them, even if you could or wanted?" Dean asks, as they walk out of Scotland on foot, just to stretch the moment, to let their heads cool down by the highland wind.

"For two thousand years I watched the Earth, we're not allowed to come down to the ground, or to make any interference. Not that I ever thought about doing so," Cas answers quietly. "That changed after we met."

Dean smiles bitterly. "And it's not making things any easier, isn't it?"

"No," Cas agrees, turning his head slightly, looking at Dean's side. But he doesn't elaborate.

And Dean thinks he can start to understand now. He imagines an angel sitting on the edge of the cloud, looking down at the earth. For thousands of years, Cas would just watch, and now, for the first time, he's walking among them. How can it possibly *not* be confusing and easy to make mistakes? How can they even remotely expect him to act the same way humans would do, making the same choices, the "right" choices as they'd make, in the difficult times? And yet, Cas is here, walking alongside him, keeping him company, making moves together with him. What more can he ask?

Dean glances at Cas, running into Cas's eyes. And he says, quiet and sincere, "I'm so sorry, Cas." and, "Thank you."

He doesn't explain why.

But he thinks Cas understands.

Because the angel has a tiniest curl on the tip of his lips. And Dean doesn't miss it.
