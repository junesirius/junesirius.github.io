The plan is disrupted by a massive explosion -- explosions, plural, and both figuratively and literally. The ground shakes violently once, twice, then a third time.

From outside their half-covered window, they can see purple smoke rising from the ground in the distance. Rowena's eyes light up with the same shade of bright purple light at almost the same time, inhaling sharply. "It's happening," she says, staring into the space in front of her, eyes unfocused, wide with excitement.

"What's happening?" Sam dashes to her, alerted.

"So many new lives in the magic, I can feel them. So many saved," Rowena mutters. "Oh I think the angel is saving us, saving us from all those terrible, terrible fates from those old, dark ages. Thank you, Castiel."

Dean changes an alarming look with Sam.

"What did he do this time?" Dean mouths.

Sam shakes his head, turning on the TV. The purple smoke and light aren't only happening in the states, apparently. The breaking news reports it's happening everywhere all over the world, but experts have located the first wave starting from Scotland, near the old site of villages where rumor has it the most women have been accused of witchery and burned to death during popular witch-hunting activities about three hundred years ago.

"The ground zero time matches," Sam murmurs quietly. "And the location."

"You think Cas bringing her here is causing all this?" Dean winces. They should know, when the time travel shenanigan has ever stopped being a pain in the ass and causes more trouble than it fixes? *Back to the Future*, *12 Monkeys*, *Doctor Who*, take your pick. They even had that *Titanic* accident merely a year ago, surely Cas wouldn't forget that?

Dean starts pacing without noticing. "Cas, whatever you're doing in Scotland, stop and come back to us, alright? We don't need another global witch problem on top of the Leviathan problem -- unless, I don't know, they cancel each other out. But I wouldn't bet on that."

He takes a breath, looking up at the ceiling. "I'm sorry about lashing out at you earlier, alright? I'm just..." he sighs. "We're running out of time, and I can really use your help. So, Houston to Cas, stop running around and come back here, you hear me?"

Dean closes his eyes and focuses on his thought, calling Cas's name in his mind a couple more times for good measure, then opens his eyes again.

He looks around, waiting expectedly. Sam, too.

The news flash on TV catches their attention before the fluttering air in the room does -- though they practically happen at the same time.

One second the reporter was standing in the Scotland high ground, showing a burst of purple-cloud explosion behind her, the next, the image is cut to a new breaking news from New York. The Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) reports their current exposition of volcanic exhibits has to stop, because the local government of Pompeii, Italy protests that the local people want their households back. In fact, their local government has made a long series of protests and announcements just as the reporters are going to the site, as if the people are just waking up from a collective dream. The archeologists in the city report that they are very confused as to why they were even there, since the city is vigorous with life, with no visible buried fossil under volcanic lava as they previously seemed to remember.

"That's our home!" A man speaks behind them, pointing at the TV screen.

Dean and Sam turn around sharply.

There, in the middle of the cabin, stand four people dressed like ancient Romans from vintage movies or shows, with long tunics and coats wrapping around their bodies and bare feet. The man standing in front of the group looks about middle-aged, with his wife and adolescent-looking son and daughter standing behind him.

With the accident with Rowena, Dean has a pretty good guess at why they are here. But he still takes another look around them, trying vainly to find their flight driver -- but unsurprisingly, the angel isn't anywhere in sight. Dean lets out another frustrated sigh.

"Great, more history refugee," Dean mumbles, making sure it's quiet enough only Sam can hear him.

"You think Cas did that?" Sam whispers back.

"You see a second man with wings flying around like a child?" Dean bites back.

"I thought you said you're gonna apologize to him! Not, you know, trigger him even worse!" Sam grumbles, not really accusing but it certainly sounds like one to Dean's ears.

"I did!" Dean glares at his brother, shifting his feet uneasily. "Sort of, I think. He has wings! What can I do to stop him from flying around? Not like I can fly with him, am I?"

Sam shakes his head disapprovingly.

"Can you tell me where we are and what happened?" The ancient Pompeii man asks politely.

They are so focused on their problem they'd even forget that mysteriously dropped family is probably still having some jet lag for a two-thousand-year fast-forward flight.

Sam takes the burden of showing them a warm welcome from 2012 -- as "warm" as they can manage, anyway.

The man's name is Caecilius. He tells them. With his wife Metella, daughter Evelina, and his son Quintus.

"We were just having a normal day, when that man came from nowhere," Caecilius recalls.

"Let me guess, blue eyes, ruffled hair, tan trench coat?" Dean chimes in tiredly.

"Yes." Caecilius looks up at him. "He said his name is Castiel, and we had to leave with him because we were in danger."

"Must be the Volcano Day, you think?" Sam asks sideways toward Dean, who nods slightly.

"What's 'vol-ca-no'?" Caecilius interrupts confusedly.

Sam frowns, then, "Oh, I almost forgot the word 'volcano' wasn't invented until that day."

"Is the big angry fire mountain near your house particularly active that day?" Dean asks instead, "Puffing hot smokes, bubbling dragon breath, grumbling sound from under the ground? Animals and pets running around, leaving the city?"

"Mount Vesuvius has always been like that," Caecilius considers, "but never anything real or dangerous coming out of it."

"Well, not until that day." Dean corrects him.

Caecilius looks from Dean to Sam, then back to him, frowning with thoughts. "But then why us? If that's true, there are twenty thousand people in the city, why only save us?"

"I'm pretty sure it's not just you." Dean glances at the TV, which is showing the street scenes in Pompeii now, seeming like just any other normal-looking village with normal people walking around on a normal day.

"Because I prayed, Dad," the daughter suddenly speaks, "and I think he's an angel. He heard me."

"Yeah, he does that," Dean nods reflexively, "sometimes. Can you give us a minute?" He pats Sam's shoulder as he stands up. The father turns around to talk rapidly with his daughter.

Sam follows him to the corner of the cabin, keeping a distance from the family and the still-purple-eyed wicky Rowena and the kid Crowley.

"You thinking what I'm thinking?" Dean starts.

"At least now we know the last place Cas visited, and the time. Pompeii's Eruption Day, of all the time."

"As if we're not busy enough to save one world at one time, he has to come around saving other ones. In history!"

"Maybe he's just trying to help?"

"How? How does a suddenly non-extinct city in Italy that's supposed to be buried underground two thousand years ago help us fight Leviathans?"

"I don't know, but maybe, alright? He's an angel; he might see things in a grand schema that we don't know about. And don't forget, Cas can be a strategist too; he led the Heaven Civil War before."

"Yeah, and that's when he decided unsinking the Titanic was a great idea! Why am I having the feeling he's not really being *strategic*, just wandering around in the timeline and doing what he can when he can, like... like a freaking child." Dean rubs his eyes tiredly. "I don't really know what to do anymore, Sam. I'm worried. If only he could just come back to us and listen, and talk!"

"Then ask that in your prayer. He might listen if you really mean it."

"You don't think I tried?"

"Try harder, Dean. It's Cas." Sam gives him a look.

Dean sighs, nodding briefly.

Sam goes back to the room now crowded with people.

Dean stands at the threshold of the cabin, looking up at the sky. "Cas," he whispers under his breath, thinking. He has to pause there for a second too long to compose his thoughts. He remembers the last wounded look on Cas's face when he couldn't help snapping at him, and the angel decided to run away to Scotland and Italy.

He lets his breath out, long and slow. "I'm not mad at you, Cas," he tells the sky slowly. "Please, we can fix this, together. You and me, whatever we did, " -- he managed to use "we" instead of "you" there, forcing himself not to turn into the angry Hulk mode again, "we can fix this. We can save lives." *I can save you,* his mind supplies, when his voice is choked in the throat, *like all those times you saved me.*

*Come back to me, Cas. Please.*

He stares at the sky hard. Feeling his eye sockets hot.

*I need you.*

*Whatever state you're in, at the end of the day, you're still my best friend, my family.*

Then he waits.

(**Notes after chapter:**

This chapter in its entirety is inspired by Doctor Who S04E02 *The Fires of Pompeii*. It's just too tempting not to write the crazy broken Cas pays a visit to Pompeii, trying to save as many people as he can, with a single mindset being "he has to save people" like Dean told him to.

There is a known loophole I don't want to get into trouble fixing so I pretend it's not there: Let's just pretend ancient people from Pompeii also speak fluent English so they can understand each other just fine without a translator.)
