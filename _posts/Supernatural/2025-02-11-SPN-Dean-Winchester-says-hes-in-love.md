(tag: S13E12, hurt/comfort, only a teeny tiny bit of hurt I promise, chick-flick, bitter sweet, fluffy in the end)

Dean hums a cheerful tune as he descends from the stairs, singing to himself a random jazz or sort that his own brain can't register. His feet tap on the ground along with the tune, even do a little spinning dance when he enters the library.

Cas is by the desk, some book spreading in front of him. He hears the sound, looking up, surprised, "Dean?"

Dean is smiling, not the grinning type, actually beaming with joy. Eyes sparkling with energy, lip smiling so wide they reach the ears.

"Oh Cas, you're back." Dean sees him, eyes sliding past him, going straight to the end cabinet where they keep the magical stuffs. He dances to the corner, keeping the tune in whistle. "Sam and I were just talking about giving you a call."

"Yes, about that," Cas sighs, eyeing his back, turning halfway round on the chair. "I'm sorry but that wasn't me, I was trapped by Asmo--"

"Ah here you are." Dean isn't listening. He is holding the Black Grimoire that he just brought out from the cabinet's top drawer, carefully unwrapping its cover cloth on the library desk.

Cas studies his face, contemplating, "you look happy."

Dean shoots him a quick glance, "because I *am* happy." He grins bigger, announcing, "I'm in love."

Cas looks at him. "Oh," he says, and pauses, taken aback.

Dean looks down at the uncovered book, sinking dreamily into his memory. "I mean, I'm like, I can't believe it can actually happen to me, you know? The love of my life, love at the first sight, Romeo and Juliet story, I thought those were like fairytales, but it's all real! Jamie, she's beautiful, she's sweet, she's so kind, I mean, she's just perfect. I just find my soul mate."

"Jamie." Cas chews on the name, listens to him talking, looking. Just looking at Dean's face with all his attention, eyes wide and deep blue. Dean looks so happy. Cas watches in total silent. He swallows.

"Do you trust her?" he asks.

"'Cause I do, can't love without trust, innit?" Dean answers absent-mindedly.

Cas swallows again, harder. "I guess so."

Dean looks up, fingers tapping on the book, corner of his eyes wrinkled with happiness, "I can't wait for you to meet her, either. Actually, I'm thinking of asking her to move in with me, you know, sorta big step, but I know she's the right one. You'd be cool with that?"

"Uh," Cas's throat works, squeezing through the lump. "Of course," he says, managing a tiny smile. "If she makes you happy."

Dean nods at him, reaching forward to pat Cas on the shoulder once. "Thanks. I know you'd understand. If it's Sam here, he wouldn't possibly take it easily. Speaking of, where's he anyway?" He only just notices Sam isn't in the room, not that he worries.

"Sam's in the county library," Cas tells him. "Said he just found a new book coming in earlier, left right when I came back."

"Tell him to prepare dinner for four, okay?" Dean says, thinking twice, smiling to himself. "Actually, make it five, Jamie has a sister, I might can help make the two of them a pair too, you know, the less attractive siblings, that's kinda cute, right?"

"I don't think..." Cas manages, but Dean's already turning around, grabbing the book and impala key from the desk.

"Where are you going?"

"I'm just gonna give her a small gift and bring her home." Dean looks over his shoulder, waving the Black Grimoire in his hand.

At that, Cas squints, starts standing up. "Wait, that's a powerful magic book." His face turns serious and concerning, walking closer, pinning Dean in the eyes, "Dean, did she specifically ask for this book, like by name?"

"Yeah!" Dean answers cheerfully. "Don't you think it's kinda like cosmic fate? What she wants, I happen to actually have it? Just like..." He waves his hands over the head, gesturing the brain explosion.

"Dean, Dean, slow down." Cas reaches him now, grabbing Dean by shoulder. "Maybe you want to think about it --"

"Life is too short, Cas, no time to waste, especially for love like this. I can't bear another minute not being with her." Dean looks at him, eyes intense with longing.

Cas winces, retreating his hand. "Ok," he manages, voice tight. "I'll come with you then. Didn't you say you want to introduce her?"

Dean considers for less than a second. "Why not?"

<br>

Impala rolls into the market parking lot where Dean went for the 6-pack. He pounds on the pedal harder than usual, jumping out of the car even before it fully stopped, waving hands high above head to two girls standing by a silver car.

Cas follows him out of the car with a sigh, falling two steps behind.

"Jamie!" Dean smiles even brighter than before. Cas watches from the side. The girls stop chirping.

Jamie is indeed a beautiful girl, Cas can't help noticing. Young, long wavy blond hair, big black eyes, tall and slim. Exactly the type Dean would like.

"Who's that?" The younger girl of the two asks, tilting her chin to point at him.

"You always bring body guard to dates?" Jamie looks at Dean.

Dean smiles at her, can't taking his eyes away from the stare.

Cas lets the two steps between them become three maybe four steps, staying at their peripheral, not walking any closer. Personal space, he remembers, Dean had mentioned it to him. Though he can still hear all the conversations, being a celestial being and all.

"No, uh, just a friend," Dean is telling her. "Want to introduce you to my friend, that's all."

Cas glances at the car, thinking about going back waiting in the seat. The girls look cute -- lovable, one may say. He can't sense any ghost or demon or immediate supernatural danger. Maybe it *is* what Dean said?

Dean puts the Black Grimoire into Jamie's hand. "The book you wanted, delivered as promised."

Jamie grabs it, stepping even closer than they already were, standing on her toes. "Good boys get a kiss." She whispers, their mouths inches away. Dean closes his eyes. Cas looks away.

"Oh, and one more thing," the younger sister suddenly says. "Where's the key? I want the impala."

Cas jerks his head up.

Dean fishes the key out of pocket, handing to her. "There you are, one gift for each."

Now, ***that***, is something completely wrong.

Cas charges the few steps in a blink, yanks Dean away, and grabs the key back from the Jamie girl.

"Who are you? What did you do to him?" he snaps, glaring at the girls. "Is that mind control? Or love potion? What is it?"

"Hey hey, what are you doing? Don't yell at her!" Dean gets loose of his hold, pushing him angrily away from the girls.

"Dean, you're not yourself! No way you'd give up the impala, whoever it is, that much I know for sure." Cas tries to get himself free from Dean's grab, but somehow it seems Dean suddenly appears to be everywhere on him now. His weight catches him by surprise. Both of them fall to the ground, arms and legs wrestled together. The girls giggle loudly several steps away from them.

"But I love her too much!" Dean yells back, struggling from the wrestle for freedom, hitting Cas's head and abdomen by his elbow. Cas didn't expect that, his head hit the ground, a small stream of blood dripping from the skull.

"Why don't you do me another favor, lover boy?" Jamie bends down a little, enjoying the view closer, before making sure the eye contact with Dean and telling him in a sticky sweet voice: "Kill him."

"Dean, don't!" A small strike of panic rises in his stomach. Cas wants to check on Dean but Dean's action already starts getting more violent. He is forced to have some small self-defense instead.

Dean's fists falling onto his cheek, Cas can feel something broken in this body of his, but the pain is dull. He grabs Dean's wrists. That's when Dean spots the glinting of the angel blade hidden in his sleeve.

"NO!" Cas gasps. Dean gets hold of the angel blade, swinging at him, pinning him down on the ground.

The sky is blue and bright, and Dean's face covered in blood stain and wounds. Cas belatedly thinks this view feel so familiar, and the other times the blade falls inches away from his skull. He wonders how this time it would end.

Dean raises the blade high above head, the other hand clenches his tie, pupils dilating and contracting, as if he's been shifting between in focus and out of focus.

"Cas?" For a brief moment, it seems Dean's back. He looks at Cas, then at the blade, confused, the indulging smile of obsession drops. He lowers the hand, the hand on Cas's throat loosens.

But next moment, his grips tighten again.

The two girls giggle so hard they are almost out of breath, before the younger one urges to leave -- the older one still have a hammer in her hand. They jump into the silver car they were leaning against before and drive away.

"Wait! Don't go! Don't leave me!" Even between hitting Cas's head to the ground, Dean manages to look at the direction the car leaves, crying out desperately.

Cas catches the breath, putting a finger on Dean's forehead. Dean's body falls limp onto the ground, fast asleep.

Cas straightens himself up from the ground, leaning onto the side of the impala, staring at Dean -- now with a purple eye and split lip, some stain of blood on his cheek that is probably tainted from Cas's, considering the warm and wet sensation that is belatedly beginning to register. Cas touches his own nose, seeing a full palm of blood.

Letting out a long sigh, he heals the both of them.

<br>

When Dean wakes up again, he's in his own room in the bunker. The room is dark without light, the clock on the nightstand says it's night now.

He touches his head, nothing hurt, nothing bleeding. His vision is clear again, without the shaky pinky bubbly distortion on the edge. He frowns to himself, trying to remember what happened, and why he's sleeping in the high afternoon with a weird dream of two young blondes and a bleeding Cas. Oh Cas-- his stomach twists, he hurries out of the room.

The library is empty. The kitchen has a light on. Cas sits by the table, his back towards the door, head low, motionless.

"Cas?" Dean walks carefully towards him.

Cas stands up suddenly, the chair stumbles back onto the ground. He snatches something that he's obviously been fiddling with inside the trench coat jacket, looking a little startled.

Dean holds up two hands, giving the peace gesture and a weak smile. "Easy, tiger, it's just me."

"Dean." Cas breathes out, almost looking ashamed, eyes moving down again. "How are you feeling?"

"Good, I guess." Dean puts down his hands, steps closer, reading his face. "What happened? You ok?"

"I'm fine." Cas says, not looking at him. "It's two witches -- three actually, if you count the zombie mom. I took care of them."

Dean nods, rounding the table, fiddling with the coffee machine, just to do something. "And the book?"

"Back where it was." Cas lifts the fallen chair up, sitting back down.

Dean looks at him from the peripheral of his eyes, frowning to himself, "Is that... is there a hex bag? It's a love spell, isn't it?"

Cas takes out the thing he hid in the pocket, putting on the table. A hex bag wrapped in red cloth, still closed.

Dean almost jumps at the sight of it, "What the hell? You didn't burn it?"

"The witches were dead, the spell should already lifted in your sleep. I don't see the necessity to burn it." Cas says, in a matter-of-fact tone.

"But it's still witchy stuff, man!" Dean eyes it cautiously, walking around it as if it's contaminating the air in its three-feet surrounding, "I don't know, just in case someone trips over it and gets hexed again or something?"

Cas answers with a light "Hmm", with his eyes locked on it. Deep in thought.

"Something in your mind?" Dean studies his pensive look, can't make out a why.

Cas hesitates.

"Cas?" Dean urges, pulling a chair next to him, sitting down by Cas's side. "What is it?"

Cas finally looks at him, eyes so deep like all the ocean on the earth is contained in there. He tells Dean, "I'm actually counting on that."

Dean tilts his head, "What'd you mean?"

Cas says, seriously, "I was thinking about asking you to use the hex bag on me."

Dean rolls his eyes, "Wha-- did you hit your head?"

Cas squints. "As a matter of fact, it's you --"

"No, never mind," Dean shakes his head, stands up, starts walking in circles in the small kitchen. "Why? It's a curse, why would you *ever* want to try it on yourself? And for no good reason? Not like this could give us some solution or whatever."

Cas looks at him, answering quietly, "I want to know how it feels like."

That makes Dean's steps dead on halt. "How *what* feels like?" He already knows the answer before asking.

"Love." Cas says, plain and straight.

At Dean's gaze, Cas continues, in the same quiet voice, "Apparently I get something totally wrong, before. About what it's like -- about what it *is*. Seeing how it *should* be, when you're under its effects..."

Dean scratches his already-messy hair, pulling them around, as if the fingers are dedicated to dragging a bunch down.

"... I'm getting some idea, but if I have been under the love spell, then I'd know for sure." Cas finishes, eyes still big and blue and all on Dean.

"Know *what* for sure?" Dean hears himself asking, can't help it.

Cas's eyes get watery for a second, before he breaks the stare, looking down on his own hands. "Know what I've been feeling is not it, and I'd know when it happens."

"Cas..." Dean hears something breaking, a glass somewhere in the cabinet? Or is it a heart? More than one, perhaps?

"Dean." Cas cuts him, fingers clenching to fists then releasing. "Please, I *need* to know. I *have* to know."

Dean has to lean on the edge of the table, hands holding his own weight, closing his eyes. Taking a long breath in, giving a long breath out.

In the darkness behind his eyelid, he sees Cas. He sees Cas storming into that barn, staring him down with the holy power from the Divine; he sees Cas frowning, sitting on the bench telling him something he wouldn't tell any other being ever existed; he sees Cas pinning him on the wall of the green room, eyes stern and pointy, right before he volunteers to face the anger of an archangel; he sees Cas spitting blood, Cas laughing with him outside that brothel, the drunk Cas, the gluttony Cas, the... the rain of flesh and blood when Lucifer kills him, then the Leviathans kill him, the purgatory, the fallen angels, the Mark of Cain...

Dean draws in a sharp breath. It wasn't even six months ago when he had to burn his body, thinking this time Cas wouldn't come back. What gets burned stays dead. But he always come back, he's always there. And here he is, sitting right across the dining table, in their home, telling him he has to be sure, because... because a stupid love spell tells him love is a moron chasing after a blonde instead of...

Dean makes a wet sound, opening his eyes. Cas is still waiting for him. Waiting for him to cast a love spell so Cas would know for sure what it *really* feels like if he *loves* him, so he would know what he is feeling now is not...

Dean blinks the wetness away. He chokes out, "It is."

Cas blinks, blank. "What is?"

Words completely fail him. Dean marches to him, dragging Cas up from the chair, into a hug. Just like the one they had before he heads out to take out Darkness with the soul boom, like the one Cas dragged him into when he came back to bunker from the supposed soul boom explosion, like the one he dragged Cas into when Cas came back from the Empty. Except, this time, no one is dying. Or just recently coming back from being dead, for that matter.

"Love." Dean closes his eyes again, holding the comforting warmth and weight in his arms tight to his body, not letting go.

"It is love, this is." Dean tells him. "You don't need a stupid love spell to be sure, because it already is. You said it yourself, that time when Ramiel stabbed you, we all thought you were gonna bite it, you said you love us, all of us."

"I said I love *you*." Cas corrects him, sniffing on his shoulder, hands on his back so tight the warmth passing through the fabric, directly onto the skin.

Dean waits until the moisture in his eyes recede to finally let go, Cas's hands still linger on his arms. Dean doesn't pull away.

"So you know," Dean looks at him, really looks at him this time, as if he hasn't seen Cas in forever. "Then why'd you still think it's not? Think I'm not..."

Cas gives him a look, corner of the eyes dropping, looking sad and regretful and utterly awful.

Dean regrets immediately for asking, fingers tracing his cheeks, palms holding his face, gentling shushing and rushing the words. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Cas. Whatever I did, all the harm I did to you all these years, I'm so, so sorry... I would never do any of that again, promise."

But Cas is shaking his head. Dean hesitantly starts pulling his hands away, only get grabbed by Cas's hands to hold them there, cheek leaning into them firmer.

"It's not you, it's me." Cas tells him, eyes closed, hints of tears catching sight at the corner. His face looks more painful than all these times when demons or angels or British's hurt him, Dean thinks. He wants to do everything to make that look not show up there ever again.

Cas looks as though having to take all the effort to push the words out. Dean squeezes his hands, hoping that's enough hint.

Cas continues, "You just said it yourself, '*can't love without trust*'. And I think -- I thought -- I have already lost all of that. Back when you told me you wished it changed anything, when... when you *trusted* me and I ruined everything..."

*I wish this changed anything.* That sounds oddly familiar, where is it from? Dean thinks, wondering, before all of that memory floods back through him. The time when he had to trap Cas in the holy fire circle, when they are... when they are enemy, almost. When things were bad, really, really bad. And then, Cas died. It seemed to be the only unchanging theme in all his memory -- seeing Cas die in all kinds of different ways, not knowing if he'd seen him again.

Part of his brains wanders far, thinking if that *was* the last time he'd ever seen Cas, how'd he feel. His mind hasn't came up with a thought, his heart already clenches hard, bleeding and breaking, the pain so sharp that he actually gasps, thinking he might have a heart attack right then and there.

"That was, what, almost seven years ago now?" Dean chokes out.

Cas gives a bitter smile. "Angels have good memory." Then, "so now you can understand why..." Tentatively, Cas is trying to draw his hand back, only to be held tight again.

"It is forgiven." Dean tells him, looking in the eyes and saying it again. "I forgave you, of course I forgave you, long time ago. You hear me? So no more self-beaten up crap now, we all good?"

At that, Cas nods and finally lets the grimace leave, a little bit at a time, gradually eased.

"Alright, enough chick-flick moment." Dean pats him gently on the shoulder, wiping his own eyes and face clean, standing up. "Where's Sam gone again? Library run can't possibly take this long."

"I'm gonna go check if there's missed phone call or anything." Dean walks towards kitchen door, when an afterthought hits him halfway. He turns, rubbing his forehead with one hand, pointing at the red hex bag that still lies on the table with other cups and plates. "And Cas? Do me a favor and burn that thing, will you? Don't need another reminder of this afternoon, and never tell anyone what happened, deal?"

Cas actually starts grinning a little. Tiny curve sprouts on the tip of his lips, the way how his grin usually starts. "Not even Sam?"

"Especially Sam!" Dean rolls his eyes. Cas giggles.

<br>

Sam comes back several more hours later. Probably right after library closes.

Dean hears his footsteps creeping down the front stairs. Dean hums a soft tune, grinning to himself while flipping through a book in front of him.

Sam walks into the room, eyeing him. "You're in a good mood. Any good news?"

Dean looks up from the book, eyes sparkling with joy, smile wide, "I'm in love."

Startled, Sam draws the pistol from his belt, aiming at Dean. "Who are you, what did you do to my brother?"

"Whoa, whoa, whoa." Dean stands up, raising hands in the surrender gesture. "Dude, it's me."

Sam narrows his eyes, regarding his brother, jerking. "Em-hmm, then what is it, love spell? Love potion? Somebody dying? Are you going to do anything stupid?"

Dean wipes the smile from his face, frowning. "What, I can't use the word '*love*' if I'm not fake or cursed or dying?"

Sam actually laughs with a scoff, lowering the gun but still holding it in the hands. "Have you met yourself, like, ever?"

Dean considers, and shrugs. "Fair, but --" The smile blooms back on his face. "-- I'm telling you, this time it's the real deal. I'm not just saying it, I'm *in* it."

He stretches his arms towards the sky, posing as if poets singing verses, doing a 360 degree spinning, and goes. "Love, what a wonderful word."

"That's enough," Sam stuffs the gun back to the belt, laughing. "You don't have to do things just to make me sick, Jerk."

"Bitch." Dean replies in knee-jump reflection.

"So who is it then, this lucky one you're so '*in love*' with?" Sam stretches his voice on the emphasis, mocking Dean's voice.

Cas walks into the room precisely this moment.

Dean thumbs over his shoulder at him, grinning. "This dude."

Sam breathes out a relieved laughter.

"Finally."
