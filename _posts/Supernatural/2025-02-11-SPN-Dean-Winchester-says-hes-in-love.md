(warning: graphic depiction of violence)

<br>

Dean hums a cheerful tune as he descends the stairs, singing to himself some random jazz or sort that his own brain can't register. His feet tap on the ground along with the tune, he even does a little spinning dance when he enters the library.

Cas is at the desk, some book spreading open in front of him. He hears the sound, looking up, surprised. "Dean?"

Dean is smiling -- not the grinning type, actually beaming with joy. Eyes sparkling with energy, lip spreading so wide in the smile it reaches the ears.

"Oh Cas, you're back." Dean sees him, eyes sliding past him, going straight to the end cabinet where they keep the magical stuff. He dances over to the corner, keeping the tune in whistle. "Sam and I were just talking about giving you a call."

"Yes, about that," Cas sighs, eyeing his back, turning halfway around in his chair. "I'm sorry, but that wasn't me, I was trapped by Asmo--"

"Ah, here you are." Dean isn't listening. He is holding the Black Grimoire that he just pulled out from the cabinet's top drawer, carefully unwrapping its cover cloth and placing on the library desk.

Cas studies his face, contemplating. "You look happy."

Dean shoots him a quick glance. "Because I *am* happy." He grins wider, announcing, "I'm in love."

Cas stares at him. "Oh," he says, pausing, taken aback.

Dean looks down at the uncovered book, sinking dreamily into his memory. "I mean, I'm like, I can't believe it can actually happen to me, you know? The love of my life, love at first sight, a Romeo and Juliet story, I thought those were like fairytales, but it's all real! Jamie, she's beautiful, she's sweet, she's so kind, I mean, she's just perfect. I just found my soulmate."

"Jamie." Cas chews on the name, listening to him talking, looking. Just looking at Dean's face with all his attention, eyes wide and deep blue. Dean looks so happy. Cas watches in total silent. He swallows.

"Do you trust her?" he asks eventually.

"'Cause I do, can't love without trust, innit?" Dean answers absent-mindedly.

Cas swallows again, harder. "I guess so."

Dean looks up, fingers tapping lightly on the book cover, the corners of his eyes crinkled with happiness. "I can't wait for you to meet her, either. Actually, I'm thinking of asking her to move in with me, you know, sorta big step, but I know she's the right one. You'd be cool with that?"

"Uh," Cas's throat works, squeezing through the lump. "Of course," he manages, forcing a tiny smile. "If she makes you happy."

Dean nods at him, reaching forward to pat Cas on the shoulder once. "Thanks, buddy. I knew you'd understand. If it were Sam here, he wouldn't possibly take it easily. Speaking of, where's he anyway?" He only just notices Sam isn't in the room, not that he worries.

"Sam's at the county library," Cas tells him. "Said he just found a new book coming in earlier, left right when I came back."

"Tell him to prepare dinner for four, okay?" Dean says, thinking twice, smiling to himself. "Actually, make it five. Jamie has a sister, I might can help make the two of them a pair too, you know, the less attractive siblings, that's kinda cute, right?"

"I don't think--" Cas hesitates, but Dean's already turning around, grabbing the book and impala keys from the desk.

"Where are you going?"

"I'm just gonna give her a small gift and bring her home." Dean looks over his shoulder, waving the Black Grimoire in his hand.

At that, Cas squints, starts to rise from his chair. "Wait, that's a powerful magic book." His face turns serious and concerning, stepping closer, pinning Dean in the eyes. "Dean, did she specifically ask for this book, like by name?"

"Yeah!" Dean answers cheerfully. "Don't you think it's kinda like cosmic fate? What she wants, I just happen to actually have it? Just like..." He waves his hands over the head, gesturing a brain explosion.

"Dean, Dean, slow down." Cas reaches him now, gripping Dean by his right shoulder. "Maybe you want to think about it --"

"Life is too short, Cas. No time to waste, especially not with a love like this. I can't bear another minute without her." Dean looks at him, eyes intense with longing.

Cas winces, retreating his hand. "Ok," he manages, voice tight. "I'll come with you then. Didn't you say you wanted to introduce us?"

Dean considers for less than a second. "Why not?"

<br>

The Impala rolls into the market parking lot where Dean had gone for a six-pack. He pounds the pedal harder than usual, jumping out of the car before it even comes to a full stop, waving his hands high above his head at two girls standing by a silver car.

Cas follows him out of the car with a sigh, trailing two steps behind.

"Jamie!" Dean beams even brighter than before. Cas watches from the side. The girls stop their chatter.

Jamie is indeed a beautiful girl, Cas can't help but notice. Young, long wavy blonde hair, big black eyes, tall and slim. Exactly the type Dean would like.

"Who's that?" The younger girl of the two asks, tilting her chin toward Cas.

"You always bring a bodyguard to dates?" Jamie looks at Dean.

Dean smiles at her, can't tearing his eyes away from the stare.

Cas lets the two steps between them stretch into three, maybe four, staying at their peripheral, not moving any closer. *Personal space*, he remembers, Dean had mentioned it to him. Though he can still hear all the conversations, being a celestial being and all.

"No, uh, just a friend," Dean is telling her. "Wanted to introduce you to my friend, that's all."

Cas glances at the car, thinking about going back to just wait in the seat. The girls look cute -- lovable, one may say. He can't sense any ghosts or demons or immediate supernatural danger. Maybe it *is* what Dean said?

Dean puts the Black Grimoire into Jamie's hand. "The book you wanted, delivered as promised."

Jamie grabs it, stepping even closer than they already were, rising on her toes. "Good boys get a kiss," she whispers, their mouths inches apart. Dean closes his eyes. Cas looks away.

"Oh, and one more thing," the younger sister suddenly says. "Where's the key? I want the Impala."

Cas jerks his head up.

Dean fishes the keys out of pocket, handing them to her. "There you go, one gift for each."

Now, ***that***, is something completely wrong.

Cas charges past the few steps in a blink, yanks Dean back, and snatches the keys from the girls.

"Who are you? What did you do to him?" He snaps, glaring at the girls. "Is this mind control? Or love potion? What is it?"

"Hey hey! What are you doing? Don't yell at her!" Dean gets loose of his hold, shoving him angrily away from the girls.

"Dean, you're not yourself! No way you'd give up the Impala, whoever it is, that much I know for sure." Cas tries to get himself free from Dean's hold, but somehow it seems Dean suddenly appears to be everywhere on him now. His weight catches him by surprise. Both of them tumble to the ground, arms and legs tangled together. The girls giggle loudly a few steps away from them.

"But I love her too much!" Dean shouts, struggling from the wrestle for freedom, hitting Cas's head and gut by his elbow. Cas didn't expect the blow, his head hits the ground, a small stream of blood dripping from his skull.

"Why don't you do me another favor, lover boy?" Jamie bends down slightly, savoring the view, before making sure locking eyes with Dean and purring in a sticky-sweet voice, "Kill him."

"Dean, don't!" A small strike of panic coils in his stomach. Cas wants to check on Dean but Dean's movements already start getting more violent. He is forced to have some small self-defense instead.

Dean's fists rain down onto his cheek, Cas can feel something broken in this body of his, but the pain is distant, dulled. He grabs Dean's wrists in defense. That's when Dean spots the glint of the angel blade hidden in his sleeve.

"NO!" Cas gasps. Dean snatches the angel blade, swinging at him wildly, pinning him down on the ground.

The sky is blue and bright, and Dean's face smeared with blood and wounds -- but still beautiful, still Dean. Cas belatedly thinks this scene feels over familiar, and that other time the blade fell inches away from his skull. He wonders how this time it will end.

'*Next time it won't miss.*' He remembers Dean's voice.

Dean raises the blade high above his head, his other hand clutches Cas's tie, pupils dilating and contracting, as if he's been flickering between in focus and out of focus.

"Cas?" For a fleeting moment, it seems Dean is back. He looks at Cas, then at the blade, confused, the indulging smile of obsession melts away. He lowers the blade, the hand on Cas's throat loosens.

But in the next heartbeat, his grip tightens again.

The two girls giggle so hard they are almost out of breath, before the younger one urges to leave -- the older girl still has a hammer in her hand. They jump into the silver car they had been leaning against before and drive away.

"Wait! Don't go! Don't leave me!" Even between slamming Cas's head into the ground, Dean manages to glance at the direction the car leaves, crying out desperately.

Cas catches the breath, putting a finger on Dean's forehead. Dean's body falls limp onto the ground, fast asleep.

Cas straightens himself up from the ground, leaning against the side of the Impala, staring at Dean -- now with a purple eye and split lip, some stain of blood on his cheek that is probably tainted from Cas's, considering the warm and wet sensation that is belatedly beginning to register. Cas touches his own nose, getting a palmful of blood.

Letting out a long sigh, he heals the both of them.

<br>

When Dean wakes up again, he's in his own room in the bunker. The room is dark without lighting, the clock on the nightstand says it's night now.

He touches his head, nothing hurt, nothing's bleeding. His vision is clear again, no more of that shaky pinky bubbly distortion at the edges. He frowns to himself, trying to remember what happened, and why he was asleep in the high afternoon with a weird dream of two young blondes and a bleeding Cas. Oh Cas-- his stomach twists, he hurries out of the room.

The library is empty. The kitchen has a light on. Cas sits at the table, his back to the door, head low, motionless.

"Cas?" Dean walks carefully toward him.

Cas stands up suddenly, the chair tumbling back onto the floor. He snatches something that he's obviously been fiddling with inside the trench coat pocket, looking a little startled.

Dean holds up two hands, giving a peace gesture and a weak smile. "Easy, tiger, it's just me."

"Dean." Cas breathes out, almost looking ashamed, eyes moving down again. "How are you feeling?"

"Good, I guess." Dean lowers his hands, steps closer, reading his face. "What happened? You okay?"

"I'm fine," Cas says, not meeting his eyes. "It was two witches -- three actually, if you count the zombie mom. I took care of them."

Dean nods, rounding the table, fiddling with the coffee machine, just to have something to do. "And the book?"

"Back where it was." Cas lifts the fallen chair, sitting back down. "The Impala's where it was too, no scratches, in case you're wondering."

Dean hums an approval, glancing at Cas from the corner of his eyes, frowning to himself, "Is that... is there a hex bag? It was a love spell, wasn't it?"

Cas takes out the thing he'd hidden in the pocket, putting on the table. A hex bag wrapped in red cloth, still sealed.

Dean almost jumps back at the sight of it. "What the hell? You didn't burn it?"

"The witches are dead, the spell should've already lifted in your sleep. I didn't see the necessity of burning it," Cas replies, in a matter-of-fact tone.

"But it's still witchy stuff, man!" Dean eyes it cautiously, walking around it as if it's contaminating the air in its three-feet surrounding. "I don't know, just in case someone trips over it and gets hexed again or something?"

Cas answers with a light "Hmm", his eyes locked on it. Deep in thought.

"Something on your mind?" Dean studies his pensive look, can't make out a why.

Cas hesitates.

"Cas?" Dean urges, pulling a chair next to him, sitting down by Cas's side. "What is it?"

Cas finally looks at him, eyes so deep like all the ocean on the earth is contained in there. He tells Dean, "I'm actually counting on that."

Dean tilts his head, "What'd you mean?"

Cas says, seriously, "I was thinking about asking you to use the hex bag on me."

Dean rolls his eyes, "Wha-- did you hit your head?"

Cas squints. "As a matter of fact, it was you --"

"No, never mind." Dean shakes his head, stands up, starts pacing in circles in the small kitchen. "Why? It's a curse, why would you *ever* want to try it on yourself? And for no good reason? Not like this could give us some solution or whatever."

Cas looks at him, answering quietly, "I want to know how it feels."

That makes Dean's steps dead on halt. "How *what* feels like?" He already knows the answer before asking.

"Love," Cas says, plain and straight.

At Dean's gaze, Cas continues, in the same quiet voice, "Apparently I get something totally wrong, before. About what it's like -- about what it *is*. Seeing how it *should* be, when you're under its effects..."

Dean scratches his already-messy hair, pulling at it like his fingers are dedicated to dragging an answer out.

"... I'm getting some idea, but if I were under the love spell, then I'd know for sure." Cas finishes, eyes still big and blue and all on Dean.

"Know *what* for sure?" Dean hears himself ask, can't help it.

Cas's eyes glisten for a second, before he breaks the stare, looking down at his own hands. "Know that what I've been feeling is not it, and I'd know when it happens."

"Cas..." Dean hears something breaking -- a glass somewhere in the cabinet? Or is it a heart? More than one, perhaps?

"Dean." Cas cuts him off, fingers clenching into fists then releasing. "Please. I *need* to know. I *have* to know."

Dean has to lean against the edge of the table, his hands holding his own weight, closing his eyes. Taking a long breath in, giving a long breath out.

In the darkness behind his eyelids, he sees Cas. He sees Cas storming into that barn, staring him down with the holy power from the Divine; he sees Cas frowning, sitting on the bench telling him something he wouldn't tell any another soul; he sees Cas pinning him to the wall of the Green Room, eyes stern and pointy, right before volunteering to face the wrath of an archangel; he sees Cas spitting blood, Cas laughing with him outside that brothel, drunk Cas, gluttonous Cas, the... the rain of flesh and blood when Lucifer killed him, then the Leviathans killed him, Purgatory, fallen angels, the Mark of Cain...

Dean draws in a sharp breath. It wasn't even six months ago when he'd had to burn his body, thinking this time Cas would never come back. What gets burned stays dead. But Cas always come back, he's always there. And here he is, sitting right across the dining table, in their home, telling him he has to be sure, because... because a stupid love spell tells him love is a moron chasing after a blonde instead of...

Dean makes a wet sound, opening his eyes. Cas is still waiting for him. Waiting for him to cast a love spell so Cas would know for sure what it *really* feels like if he *loves* him, so he'd know what he is feeling now is *not*...

Dean blinks away the wetness. He chokes out, "It is."

Cas blinks, blank. "What is?"

Words completely fail him. Dean marches over, dragging Cas up from the chair into a hug. Just like the one they had before he headed to take out Darkness with the soul boom, like the one Cas pulled him into when he came back to bunker from the supposed soul boom explosion, like the one he gave Cas when he came back from the Empty. Except this time, no one is dying. Or recently coming back from being dead, for that matter.

"Love," Dean whispers, closing his eyes again, holding the comforting warmth and weight of Cas in his arms tight to his body, not letting go.

"It is love, this is." Dean tells him. "You don't need a stupid love spell to be sure, because it already is. You said it yourself, that time when Ramiel stabbed you, we all thought you were gonna bite it, you said you love us, all of us."

"I said I love *you*." Cas corrects him, sniffing on his shoulder, hands clutching on his back so tightly the warmth seeps through the fabric, reaching directly onto the skin, sinking underneath.

Dean waits until the moisture in his eyes recedes before finally letting go. Cas's hands still linger on his arms. Dean doesn't pull away.

"So you know," Dean looks at him, really looks at him this time, as if he hasn't seen Cas in forever. "Then why'd you still think it's not? Think I'm not..."

Cas gives him a look, the corners of his eyes dropping, full of sadness and regret, looking utterly awful.

Dean immediately regrets asking. His fingers traces Cas's cheeks, palms holding his face, gently shushing and rushing the words. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Cas. Whatever I did, all the harm I did to you all these years, I'm so, so sorry... I would never do any of that again, promise."

But Cas is shaking his head. Dean hesitantly starts pulling his hands away, only get grabbed by Cas's hands to hold them there, his cheek pressing into them firmly.

"It's not you. It's me," Cas tells him, eyes closed, hints of tears pooling at the corners. His face looks more painful than all these times when demons or angels or British's hurt him, Dean thinks. He wants to do everything to make that look not show up there ever again.

Cas takes a breath, looking as though having to take all the effort to push the words out. Dean squeezes his hands, hoping that's enough hint.

Cas continues, "You just said it yourself, '*can't love without trust*'. And I think -- I thought -- I already lost all of that. Back when you told me you wished it changed anything, when... when you *trusted* me and I ruined everything..."

*I wish this changed anything.* That sounds oddly familiar, where is it from? Dean thinks, wondering, before all the memory floods back, soaking through him. The time he had to trap Cas in a holy fire circle, when they were... when they were enemies, almost. When things were bad -- really, really bad. And then, Cas died. That seemed to be the only unchanging theme in all his memories -- seeing Cas die in countless ways, never knowing if he'd see him again.

Part of his mind wanders far, thinking if that *had been* the last time he'd ever seen Cas, how'd he feel. His mind hasn't came up with a thought, his heart already clenches hard, bleeding and breaking, the pain so sharp that he actually gasps, thinking he might be having a heart attack right then and there.

"That was, what, almost seven years ago now?" Dean chokes out.

Cas gives a bitter smile. "Angels have good memory." Then, "so now you can understand why..."

Tentatively, Cas is trying to draw his hand back, only to be held tight again.

"It's forgiven," Dean tells him, looking in the eyes and saying it again. "I forgave you, of course I forgave you, a long time ago. You hear me? So no more self-beaten up crap now, we all good?"

At that, Cas nods and finally lets the grimace fade, a little bit at a time, gradually eased.

"Alright, enough chick-flick moments," Dean pats him gently on the shoulder, wiping his own eyes and face clean, standing up. "Where's Sam gone off to again? Library run can't possibly take this long."

"I'm gonna go check if there are any missed phone calls or something." Dean heads toward the kitchen door, when an afterthought hits him halfway. He turns, rubbing his forehead with one hand and pointing at the red hex bag still lying on the table with the other.

"And Cas? Do me a favor and burn that thing, will you? Don't need another reminder of this afternoon. And never tell anyone what happened. Deal?"

Cas actually starts grinning a little. A tiny curve sprouts at the tip of his lips, the way how his grin usually starts. "Not even Sam?"

"Especially Sam!" Dean rolls his eyes.

Cas giggles.

<br>

Sam comes back several hours later. Probably right after the library closes.

Dean hears his footsteps creeping down the front stairs. He hums a soft tune, grinning to himself while flipping through a book in front of him.

Sam walks into the room, eyeing him suspiciously. "You're in a good mood. Any good news?"

Dean looks up from the book, eyes sparkling with joy, smile wide. "I'm in love."

Startled, Sam draws the pistol from his belt, aiming it at Dean. "Who are you, what did you do to my brother?"

"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" Dean stands up, raising his hands in surrender. "Dude, it's me!"

Sam narrows his eyes, scrutinizing his brother, jerking. "Em-hmm, then what is it, love spell? Love potion? Somebody dying? Are you going to do something stupid?"

Dean wipes the smile off his face, frowning. "What, I can't use the word '*love*' if I'm not fake or cursed or dying?"

Sam actually laughs at that with a scoff, lowering the gun but still holding it. "Have you met yourself, like, ever?"

Dean considers, then shrugs. "Fair. But --" The smile blooms back on his face, brighter than before. "-- I'm telling you, this time it's the real deal. I'm not just saying it, I'm *in* it."

He stretches his arms towards the ceiling, posing like poets singing verses, doing a slow 360-degree spinning, and goes, "Love, what a wonderful word."

"That's enough," Sam stuffs the gun back into the belt, laughing. "You don't have to try so hard to make me sick, Jerk."

"Bitch," Dean replies in knee-jump reflection.

"So who is it then, this lucky one you're so *in love* with?" Sam draws out the words, mocking Dean's tone.

Right on cue, Cas walks into the room.

Dean thumbs over his shoulder at him, grinning. "This dude."

Sam breathes out a relieved laught.

"Finally."
