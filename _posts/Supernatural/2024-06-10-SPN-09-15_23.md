> Sam: They were just people, man. They weren't...demons. They weren't monsters. They...were just frickin' people.
>
> Dean: Yeah, well, like I said, people are sick.

> Crowley: <u>You don't know what it's like to be human!</u>
>
> Dean just stares at him.
>
> Crowley: <u>It's your DNA. It's my addiction, my cross, my burden!</u>
>
> Dean: All right, take it easy.
>
> Crowley: I see the darkness of it now, the Anthony Weiner of it. It makes you needy.

> Crowley: Poor moose. It's always a little tricky keeping up, isn't it?
>
> Sam: (looking up to find Crowley staring at him) What are you doing?
>
> Crowley: I'm still a little tainted by humanity. Makes me sentimental.
>
> Sam: Well, stop.
>
> Crowley: You and I both know we shared a mo back in that church. And on some level, we are bonded.

> Crowley: I wouldn't be in this mess if it wasn't for you two. You shoot me up. You make me a junkie. You keep me stashed away for months while my kingdom falls apart?!

> Sam: (ignoring the plea, stands up and holds the bowl out) Remember -- stay close, do what I say, and shut the hell up.

> Crowley: I know that Cain gave you his Mark for a reason. And I know that rather than embracing it, rather than looking at it as the gift that it is, you're sulking like you lost your knuffle bunny. Why are you fighting what you really are?
>
> Dean: I'm a hunter.
>
> Crowley: Who's a chip off the old Mark of Cain.
>
> Dean: No. When I kill, I kill for a reason. I'm nothing like Cain.
>
> Crowley: <u>Nothing like -- who are you talking to? I know you're not talking to me.</u>
>
> Dean: Eat me.
>
> Crowley: I saw you. I saw the two of you together. Nothing like Cain? <u>What's in that bottle? Delusion? I'm really starting to worry about you, Dean.</u>
>
> Dean: Yeah, well, why don't you worry about yourself?
>
> Crowley: I will. 'Cause like it or not, we're in this together. Your problems, my problems... Our problems.
>
> Crowley gets up and walks toward the back.
>
> Dean: Where you going now?
>
> Crowley: <u>I'm going to go water the lily. Care to cross streams? (Dean rolls his eyes) So serious.</u>

> Castiel: (looking at the honor bar fridge in the hotel room; mutters to himself) "Honor bar." What's honorable about a miniature bar in a motel room?
>
> Dean: (overhearing from the phone) Everything.
>
> Castiel: <u>(gently with a small smile) How are you, Dean?</u>

> GABRIEL: After it was raining winged men, hallelujah? Well, you know... total nigh-biblical chaos, Crowley and Aba-douche duking it out. Good times. And then there's our peeps, scattered like confetti.
>
> Castiel: There has been a lot of confusion.
>
> Gabriel: You think? Most angels aren't like us, Castiel. They can't handle this whole free-will thing. They're sheep, drones. But us? We're different. We're rebels... one without a 'cause, one with.
>
> Castiel: I'm just a soldier.
>
> Gabriel: Bitch, please. You've been God more often than Dad has.
>
> Castiel: (Chuckling) Yeah. Look how that worked out.
>
> Gabriel: Well, go ahead. Be a soldier all you want. I'm gonna need as many as I can find.
>
> Castiel: Why are you doing this, Gabriel?
>
> Gabriel: I always run...From Dad, from the family. I don't want to run anymore. I want to do what I was meant to do... lead.
>
> Castiel: Well, we need a leader. And I'm happy it's gonna be you.

> Dean: All right, so what if there is a stairway to heaven? We find it and get a drop on the guy.
>
> Sam: You want to sneak onto the Death Star, take out the emperor?
>
> Castiel: Okay I... I'm not sure what a fictional battle station in space has to do with this, but if taking out the emperor means taking out Metatron, I'm on board.
>
> Dean: (exchanging confused looks with Sam) Wait, did you... did you just understand a Death Star reference?
>
> Castiel: Yeah, I think so. But I don't understand what that has to do with heaven.
>
> Sam: It's halfway, I guess.

>
> Castiel grabs his arm and pushes up his sleeve revealing the Mark. Castiel's eyes darken as his stares at Dean.
>
> Castiel: What have you done?
>
> Dean: (yanks his hand back) It's a means to an end.
>
> Castiel: <u>Damn it, Dean.</u>

> MAN: (rips open his coat to reveals a sigil carved into his chest. He rams an angel blade through his heart as he yells) I do this for Castiel!
>
> The whole ice cream shop explodes. Video goes dead.
>
> Dean: What the hell was that?
>
> Castiel: I don't know. I didn't -- I would never ask an angel to sacrifice himself to kill innocents. I'm gonna be sick.
>
> Sam: Cass, why would an angel blow up a Colonel Scoop's in your name?
>
> Hannah: That's not what he was doing. Roll it back. There. (Hannah points the girl in the booth) That was an angel -- Esther. She's one of Metatron's.
>
> Sam: So, this was some kind of hit?
>
> Castiel: I don't know.
>
> Dean: Stop saying you don't know.
>
> Castiel: You can't think I would allow something like this.
>
> Dean: Cass, I know you try to be a good guy, okay? I do. You try. But what you got here, this is a a freakin' cult.
>
> Castiel: Dean.
>
> Dean: And the last time you had this kind of juice, you did kill humans and angels, and you did nothing but lie to me and Sam about it the whole damn time!
>
> Sam: <u>Can we, uh -- can we take this somewhere else, guys?</u>
>
> They enter Castiel's private office.
>
> Sam: Will you stow the baggage, Dean. Look, we've got a case. Let's work it. Cass, did you know the angel in that video?
>
> Castiel: Yes. His name was Oren. He was a new recruit. He worked in community outreach.
>
> Dean: And what does that mean?
>
> Castiel: Some of my troops are stationed at a local hospital. They help where they can. Minor miracles -- it's nothing that would attention.
>
> Sam: So, what was he doing in that video, with the stabbing?
>
> Castiel: The Enochian runes that were carved in his chest -- I...I think that they were meant to focus energy. When he stabbed himself, it unleashed all that power.
>
> Sam: So, what about the girl? What happened to her?
>
> Castiel: If she was the target, if the blast was focused on her, then more likely than not, she -- she was atomized. So, what do we do now?
>
> Dean: Well, you don't do jack. Me and Sam will head to the hospital, see if we can find somebody who knew this...walking nuke.
>
> Castiel: Hold on. These are my people. I can help.
>
> Dean: Well, that's sort of the problem. I mean, the Manson girls aren't gonna give us a straight answer with Charlie in the room, so just hang back.
>
> Castiel: So, I should just sit here?
>
> Dean: Pretty much.
>
> Castiel: No. If you don't want my help, then I will follow Josiah's trail to Colorado. I have to do something, Dean.
>
> Dean: All right, fine. But Sam's coming with you.
>
> Sam: What?
>
> Castiel: <u>Because you don't trust me?</u>
>
> Dean: To help.

> DELETED SCENE
>
> *INT. COMMAND CENTER*
>
> Sam and Dean leave Castiel'S office.
>
> Sam: Dean, wait. <u>What the hell, man? You don't really think that he--</u>
>
> Dean: Look, I don't--I don't know what to think. All right? Look, we've got angels turning into terrorists, we've got these flying douchebags wanna shiv each other, that's fine. But when people get caught in the middle... that's not happening again, not on my watch.
>
> Sam: And Cass?
>
> They look back and see Castiel talking to Hannah as they look at a file.
>
> Dean: Look, I hope it was just some nutbag, okay? <u>I hope that Cass is telling the truth. But if he's not, we'll burn that bridge when we come to it. You just keep an eye on him.</u>
>
> Sam: Is that an order? 'Cause you've been giving a lot of those lately.
>
> Dean: Dude, come on.
>
> Sam: No, you come on, Dean. We're a team here, remember?
>
> Dean: You're right, yeah. I just got caught up, my bad.
>
> Sam and Dean leave the command center as Castiel and Hannah watch.
>
> Hannah: Are you sure one of us shouldn't come along? I mean, <u>the way he talked to you, I don't trust them.</u>
>
> Castiel: Sam and Dean may be a little rough... <u>but they're the best men I've ever known.</u>

> Sam and Castiel drive down the road in Castiel's car.
>
> Castiel: Abaddon is dead.
>
> Sam: And then some.
>
> Castiel: Oh, no.
>
> Sam: Okay. Um...Ominous.
>
> Castiel: <u>Does Dean seem different to you?</u>
>
> Sam: Yeah. Lately, he seems to be...amped up --you know, on edge.
>
> Castiel: Effects of the mark?
>
> Sam: What else?
>
> Castiel: He does seem angry. I mean, he's always a little angry, but now it seems like...more. <u>I think a part of him actually believed that I ordered those angels to, you know...Sam, you don't, do you?</u>
>
> Sam: No, man. Cass, listen. You got a weird thing going on back there. Those other angels, the way they stare at you, I-it's like you're part rock star, part L. Ron.
>
> Castiel: They've put their faith in me.
>
> Sam: And maybe that's the problem. I mean, people have been doing messed up crap in the name of faith -- in the name of God -- since forever.
>
> Castiel: Well... I'm not trying to... play God. I'm just trying to get my people home.

> Hannah: You gave us order, Castiel, and we gave you our trust. Don't lose it over one man. (She hands a blade to Castiel) This is justice.

> Dean: So, batteries...
>
> Castiel: I'm fine.
>
> Dean: No, you're not. <u>How long you got?</u>

> Castiel: <u>Long enough to destroy Metatron, I hope.</u> But without an army...

> Castiel: Dean. Those bombers -- you don't really think that I --
>
> Dean: <u>Cass, you just gave up an entire army for one guy. No, there's no way that you blew those people away.</u>
>
> Castiel: You really believe we three will be enough?

> Metatron: Ah. So Gadreel bites the dust. And the Angel tablet -- arguably the most powerful instrument in the history of the universe -- is in pieces, and for what again? Oh, that's right -- <u>to save Dean Winchester</u>. That was your goal, right? I mean, <u>you draped yourself in the flag of heaven, but ultimately, it was all about saving one human</u>, right? Well, guess what. He's dead, too.
>
> Castiel's horrified eyes shoot to Metatron's face.

> Crowley: Your brother, bless his soul, is summoning me as I speak. Make a deal, bring you back. It's exactly what I was talking about, isn't it? It's all become so... expected. You have to believe me. When I suggested you take on the Mark of Cain, I didn't know this was going to happen. Not really. I mean, <u>I might not have told you the entire truth. But I never lied. I never lied, Dean. That's important. It's fundamental.</u> But...there is one story about Cain that I might have... forgotten to tell you. Apparently, he, too, was willing to accept death, rather than becoming the killer the Mark wanted him to be. So he took his own life with the Blade. He died. Except, as rumor has it, the Mark never quite let go. You can understand why I never spoke of this. Why set hearts aflutter at mere speculation? It wasn't until you summoned me... No, <u>it wasn't truly until you left that cheeseburger uneaten...that I began to let myself believe.</u> Maybe miracles do come true.
>
> Crowley moves to the bed and places the First Blade into Dean's right hand and lays them both on Dean's chest.
>
> Crowley: Listen to me, Dean Winchester, what you're feeling right now -- it's not death. It's life -- a new kind of life. Open your eyes, Dean. <u>See what I see. Feel what I feel. And let's go take a howl at that moon.</u>
