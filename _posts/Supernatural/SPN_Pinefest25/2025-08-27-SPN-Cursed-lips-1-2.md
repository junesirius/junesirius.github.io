> The sun was gentle and warm for a November day. Kids were running and laughing in the playground. Dean looked at them, savoring the moment. The air beside him stirred with a light flutter of wings on the park bench. Dean didn't take his eyes away from the kids.
>
> "Let me guess. You're here for for I-told-you-so," he said nonchalantly.
>
> "No," Castiel answered simply.
>
> "Well, good," said Dean, turning halfway to the angel, "'cause I'm really not that interested." The light mood of seeing the kids playing in the park vaporized.
>
> "I'm not here to judge you, Dean," the angel said quietly, frowning slightly, turning to look at Dean.
>
> Dean realized he didn't know when he turned to face him fully, and now his gaze was fixated on Castiel's eyes again. He frowned a little, forcing his brain to focus on the conversation instead of the view. "Then why are you here?" he asked.
>
> "Our orders --" Castiel started, but immediately cut off by a fed-up Dean by saying "I've had about enough of these 'orders' of yours --" He even shot the angel a challenging look with a raised eyebrows to pull a full set of irritated look.
>
> But Castiel did not give up his speech easily. He continued as if undisturbed, staring Dean down. "Our *orders*," he gritted the word, grasping the human's attention, "were not to stop the summoning of Samhain. They were to do whatever you told us to do."
>
> Dean blinked dumbfoundedly, confused. *That can't be right.* "Your orders were to follow my orders?" He was almost amused by the idea. *Who was he to order two angels? To order angel like Castiel what to do?* The mere thought of that alone felt wrong. He studied the angel's face intently, hoping to see a sign of trickster, that it was a joke.
>
> But Castiel only nodded small. "It was a test," he told the human. "To see how you would respond under battlefield conditions, you might say." He thinned his lips, almost as if he was particularly fond of the decision and the tests Heaven put Dean through. As if he was angry on Dean's behalf. Or empathetic. Dean watched those lips letting out a tiniest sigh, unsure of what exactly he saw there. Or why.
>
> Dean wetted his dry lips, weighing the words that were thrown onto him. "It was a witch. Not the Tet Offensive." He aimed for a light tone and a casual shrug, as if saving the life of one thousand, two hundred and fourteen people in this town wasn't such a big deal. The joke was lame, even Dean knew, the moment it left his tongue.
>
> But even Castiel allowed a small smile. Barely a facsimile of a smile, really, but the very first one closest to a smile that Dean's ever seen him. Dean found himself magnetized by it. His gaze hovered at the little curve at the tip of the angel's lips.
>
> *He was beautiful.* Dean found himself thinking, and had to bite on his lower lip to pull back that train of thoughts.
>
> Castiel didn't answer to that, only stare at the grassland before them. Dean felt the obligation of filling the moment of silence between them, as well as the space between the benches they sit on. It was no more than a human's width, but it felt too far, like a gap in the universe he couldn't cross to reach the angel.
>
> Dean swallowed, forcing words to form and flow out of his throat. He took a short breath to smooth it. "So I failed your test, huh?" he started saying, thinking over what happened in the past two days, frowning deeper. "I get it. But you know what?" he paused briefly, considering his words, wetting his lips that became so quickly so dried again under the angel's eyes.
>
> Dean continued, slow but not hesitant, "If you were to wave that magic time-traveling wand of yours and we had to do it all over again? I'd make the same call." He gave Castiel a look that was saying *I do not regret what I did. That's who I am. So deal with it.*
>
> And the angel seemed to understand. Castiel nodded quietly, waiting for Dean to finish.
>
> Dean was encouraged by the look on his face, the glistening lights in his eyes, and that ghosting hint of a smile still lingering at the corner of his lips. "'Cause I don't know what's gonna happen when these seals are broken. Hell, I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow. But what I do know is that this here --" he gestured to the playground, the joyful bright kids and people, the bright sunshine above their heads, the grass growing under their feet, "-- these kids, the swings, the trees... All of it is still here because of my brother and me." He reasoned, but the angel wasn't the only one he tried to persuade. *Did he really miss the "bigger picture" like the angels told him? Did he just make another mistake like all the other mistakes in their life, and condemned six billion human beings because he wasn't willing to sacrifice one thousand?* Dean looked at the angel, wondering what Castiel really thought of his decision, really he thought of *him* now.
>
> Castiel turned fully to Dean, his face heavy with all the compassion and empathy. His eyes returned Dean's gaze, holding him there, anchoring him. There was no disapproval or disappointment in those blue eyes, only understanding, with a sprinkle of pain. "You misunderstand me, Dean," he said. "I'm not like you think. I was *praying* that you would choose to save the town."
>
> Dean was surprised. "You were?" That was something he didn't dare to have hope for, but Castiel surprised him.
>
> "These people, they are all my Father's creations. They are works of art." His gaze flashed to the people in park briefly before landing back on Dean. *Including you, Dean,* his eyes were saying quietly, *you are the best of all those creations and the most beautiful works of art.* The emotions stirred in those eyes like ripples in a lake, swirling darker.
>
> Dean winced under those eyes, unsure of what he read, uneased by the look of appreciation and other things that were too kind to be real because he was damn sure he didn't deserve them. He lowered his gaze, drifting down to the angel's mouth. It was as dry as all those other times he saw. Dean ran his tongue over his lips, as if it could wet the lips in his view.
>
> "And yet, even though you stopped Samhain, the seal was broken," Castiel was still speaking. His face hardened. "And we are one step closer to Hell on Earth for all creation. And that's not an expression, Dean. It's literal. You, of all people, should appreciate what that means."
>
> Panic flickered through him like an electric wave of shock. Dean took a shallow breath, and felt his chest too tight to let that sigh out. *If the Armageddon fell on Earth, couldn't say he wasn't warned. And he would know, with all the pain and consequence for all the eternity, it might just because of the mistake they made today, because he wouldn't let a town and a thousand people die -- even knowing that, he still wouldn't.*
>
> He looked at the angel, thinking, asking silently, *What should I do, Cas?* For once, without saying it out loud, Dean thought, he was properly scared. Less scared than when he watched Sam die in his arms, more scared than when he was dragged to Hell by a Hellhound. *How do I make the right choice? If you have the answer, please tell me.*
>
> And as if heard the voice in his mind, Castiel said, more quietly than before, frowning deeper than before, "Can I tell you something if you promise not to tell another soul?" His tone was so careful, so trusting, that Dean swallowed again around the lump in his throat.
>
> "Okay," he squeezed the voice out.
>
> "I'm not a 'hammer,' as you say," the angel confessed, his eyes averted, staring at his own clenched hands. "I have questions. I have doubts." He glanced at the sky, at Heaven's direction, and he looked away, as if he couldn't even bear to think about Heaven for too long at this moment, as if he was ashamed.
>
> Dean watched him intently, capturing every move of his eyes, every quiver of his lips. He didn't know the pain and uncertainty he witnessed, if they were the reflection of his or Castiel's. Perhaps both.
>
> And the confession stretched on. "I don't know what is right and what is wrong anymore. Whether you passed or failed here." They shared another glance, another stare. "But in the coming months you will have more decisions to make. I don't envy the weight that's on your shoulders, Dean. I truly don't."
>
> Dean clenched his jaw at that, rendered breathless by the knowledge and burden in Castiel's eyes and voice. *But at least I got you here with me, right?* He thought, not daring to say that out. *He felt too small and too big at the same time. They were talking about Apocalypse and Heaven and Hell and Angel and Demon here, and how could him, a vanilla human (okay, maybe adding a bit spice and juice) got to play on this big chessboard?* Even just talking with angels, with Castiel, still made his stomach flutter.
>
> Dean looked at the angel -- really looked at him -- thinking of the celestial being resided within this vessel, behind the cloth and flesh, behind those lines and curved on his face, behind those eyes and lips, the being that could destroy him within a blink. And yet, at the same time, Castiel was just sitting in a park bench with him, looking nothing different from a human, telling him, even as an angel, "he wasn't a hammer," telling him things that he wouldn't share with any other soul except for Dean.
>
> So here they were, on the park bench, under the sunshine of a November morning, staring at each other, long and quiet, both thinking dazedly: *The person sitting with them was so unbelievable* and *They are going to be so screwed*.
