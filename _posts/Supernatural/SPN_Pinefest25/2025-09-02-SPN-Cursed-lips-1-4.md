> Dean jumped when Cas's reflection popped into the mirror, barely inches away. His heartbeat raced like a frantic rabbit for a hot minute, and he could still feel his temples throbbing when he lashed out: "God! Don't do that!"
>
> He thumped the sink.
>
> The angel didn't seem to realize the problem, merely frowned slightly at his reflection, and answered with his classic opening flatly with his deep voice: "Hello, Dean."
>
> Dean pivoted from the place by the sink where he was cleaning the bloodstains on his favorite green jacket with a damped washcloth. And there he was, Cas -- the miraculously resurrected angel of Thursday, living for eons and not understanding a thing of delicate human social rules -- standing less than half a foot away from him. His lips less than three inches.
>
> Dean couldn't help his eyes flickering downward, attracted by them incorrigibly. His brain put up a pretended war, forcing his eyes moving up, lingering on the angel's eyes instead. Those eyes were too hot to stare at in this distance. Dean could practically feel the heat from his body and the flow of air from his breath. *It's too close. It's way too close.*
>
> Dean's eyes gave up the fight, moving down to the lips that were split with a small slit. Five o'clock stubble sprinkled across his lips.
>
> Dean had to use all his brain power to tear his eyes away. He spoke, but the words coming out in a whisper as if he was incapable of talking any louder when the angel stood this close to him. He whispered, "Cas, we've talked about this. Personal space?"
>
> Cas narrowed his eyes in confusion for a split second, eyes searching on the human's face. *What an annoying race with all the complicating rules.* But walking the Earth for little over a year, he did learn to pick up a thing or two on human emotions and facial expressions. And right now, he read "uneasy" on Dean's face, which was usually one step away from anger.
>
> Cas took a step back quickly. "My apologies." He lowered his eyes, a look of obedience.
>
> Dean threw him a quick glance, grabbed his jacket, and walked past the angel toward the bed. "How did you find me? I thought I was flying below the angel radar." He gestured at his ribs to illustrate the point. He wouldn't ever forget the hilariously startled and confused looks on the faces of x-ray technicians and then the doctors. He'd find it humorous too if he's not the one being carved. *Just how much imprints do Castiel have to leave on him? First with the handprint on his shoulder, then the rib carve. That's a possessive son of a bitch. Not like he owned him.* He found himself thinking, and the thought somewhat took a nosedive from unsettling to unbelievably erotic within merely a second. He swallowed the thought down.
>
> "You are." Cas confirmed his point, "Bobby told me where you were."
>
> *Traitor.* Dean thought, huffing out a quiet laugh.
>
> The angel didn't seem to notice, for he was busy scanning through the empty motel room, with one ruffled single bed and one duffle bag on the floor. No sign of the second brother.
>
> "Where's Sam?" Cas asked with a serious, growing frown.
>
> It was an easy topic and Dean really, really didn't want to have that discussion with the angel at this moment. He took a minute before answering, as nonchalantly as he could manage, "Me and Sam are taking separate vacations for a while." He put on his jacket as if it was a layer of armor he could protect himself with. Cas observed him quietly from two steps away, not commenting.
>
> "So." Dean pressed, eager to switch the topic. He sorted out the collar of the newly put-on jacket, turning to the angel with pointed eyes. "Did you find Got yet? More importantly, can I have my damn necklace back, please?" He almost felt compelled to let Cas know how that necklace never left him ever since twelve when he put it on for the first time. He didn't know what get the better of him to agree giving Cas that amulet, maybe that was the tone Cas told him "I lost everything for you, for nothing," or the fierce but broken look in his eyes. He just couldn't refuse at that time. And now it was almost like his brain and his body were all itching to have it back at the first chance.
>
> "No, I haven't found him." Cas answered matter-of-factly, tilting his chin mildly, meeting his eyes straightly. "That's why I'm here. I need your help."
>
> Dean busied himself with rolling his sleeves up so he wouldn't need to return the looks he knew Castiel was throwing at him. "With what? God hunt?" he murmured, semi-amused at the idea. "Not interested." It was easier to say no when he didn't have to meet Cas in the eyes, he learned his lesson by now.
>
> The rejection made Cas turn his head away, staring at the disorganized interior of the motel room. "It's not God. It's someone else." Worry started growing inside him. *He needed Dean*, the angel thought, despite his pride. But the human didn't seem to realize how big of a deal this was. Dean didn't change a bit since last year about how annoying he could get to, even if he might eventually agree on something, it would never be an easy persuasion.
>
> Cas's tone made Dean look up, fixing him with a more serious look. He paused a beat, knowing he'd regret asking but it was also so obvious Cas was trouble. Dean asked, "Who?"
>
> "It's an Archangel." Cas told him, getting increasingly more worried as he spoke, taking steps to shorten the three steps' distance between them until he stood right before Dean again, disregarding the personal space. "The one who killed me." Dean didn't know the exact details of his death, the moment when the Archangel's light falling onto him, the moment he stood in the prophet's house facing that dawning light, knowing without doubt that he'd be annihilated without a flesh from his vessel or a thread of light from his Grace. It was so instant that there was no pain or fear. His mind was on Dean at that moment, knowing he was doing the right thing, that they were saving the world, together and off-script. He was free, and a little fluttering in his heart. He would never tell Dean any of it.
>
> Dean watched him intently from six inches away, arching his eyebrows. "Excuse me?" People don't usually talk about their killers so lightly -- well, *people* don't usually come back after they were killed and then talking about the ones killed them with a flat tone and a minor frown. They still didn't know how Cas came back -- not that Dean complained about that particular miracle though, he just wondered who he should send a card and flower bouquet to.
>
> The muscle on Cas's cheekbone twitched with a ghost of emotion -- not hatred, exactly, more like a mild disaffection and displeasure.  "His name is Raphael," he told Dean.
>
> Dean raised his amused eyebrows higher and lowered his voice, stifling a muted laugh, "You were wasted by a teenage mutant ninja angel?"
>
> It must be one of Dean's usual culture reference that Castiel didn't have the patience to indulge or even just humor him with a look of confusion -- he knew how much Dean just enjoyed watching him tilt his head in confusion whenever he thought he came up with something clever and knew Cas wouldn't understand. For whatever reason, it seemed to give Dean some sense of joy or satisfaction. But today wasn't one of these days, the matter was too urgent, so Cas didn't indulge him today. Instead, he cut right back to the tricky problem by hand. "I've heard whispers that he's walking the earth. This is a rare opportunity."
>
> Dean regarded him carefully. "For what? Revenge?"
>
> "Information," the angel corrected him flatly.
>
> Dean huffed a small laugh, shifting his eyes away. "So you think if you find this dud, he's just gonna spill God's address?" He kept his tone light, and walked past Cas, went to pick up his knife and washcloth from the sink.
>
> Cas didn't turn around. "Yes," he said stoically, the plan was already there, he just needed Dean to help, to cooperate. He panned out the plan, "because we are gonna trap him and interrogate him."
>
> Dean paused on the work in his hand that was halfway cleaning his knife, and turned back at him. "You're serious about this." The lightness vanished from his voice.
>
> Castiel turned around to face him. His face dead serious. His eyes were as steady and... deadly (which was just another term for suicidal in his case, in Dean's mind) as the day he pushed Dean to the wall of the Beautiful Room before cutting his arm open for the sigil. And Dean recognized it with a shiver through his spine.
>
> "Yes," Cas pronounced simply.
>
> Dean let go of the washcloth in his hand, stepping toward the angel slowly, with the freshly cleaned blade waving in his right hand. His gut twisted, Dean realized, but he didn't know why. It must be the way Cas stared at him right this moment, the same heated look before his eyes asking *Do you trust me? I'm ready to die for you. Is this what you want?* And Dean didn't have a second to pause and really think it over before answering with a nod, before realizing the meaning of his nod.
>
> That day, he could have died -- he should have; Sam could have died; and Cas actually died, before all of them were magically brought back to life. He nodded at that time, telling Cas (without himself really knowing what he's asking, or rather, he did, but he didn't want to think about it too hard) *Go, die for me.*
>
> Dean paused before Cas, frowning with disbelief. *Is today a replay of that again? Are they going to die for some big bullshit cause again?* He thought, and he didn't have to ask to know the answer. It was the same look, same whirling shadow in his dark eyes. Cas's blue eyes were almost black now, and the lines on his face were tightened. His lips thinned to a line.
>
> Dean's eyes flickered across his face, treading through his eyes to his lips, and he had to force out a laugh to release the weight on his chest before he was able to speak again. Dean heard himself saying, "So what, I'm Thelma and you're Louise, and we're just gonna hold hands and sail off this cliff together?" His mind decidedly *not* wandered to the fact that *Thelma and Louise*, if anything, was probably *the* most classic road movie with same-gender characters that were most definitely *not* having romantic feelings with one another. It was just a story with two people dying together at the end of a long and fucked trip -- exactly what they were, weren't they?
>
> Cas just stared at him, frowning in aching confusion. Dean didn't know what he was waiting for exactly.
>
> He shut his eyes for a long second and let out an exhausted exhale, walking away from the angel to put his knife into his half-sorted duffel bag. "Give me one good reason why I should do this." He chose to say instead, his back to Cas. It was not a rejection per say, but close enough.
>
> Cas turned to him. "Because you're Michael's vessel and no angel will dare harm you," he answered dutifully. The strategic reason might be the easiest to pass for "one good reason" to persuade Dean, Cas reasoned quietly.
>
> Dean was stiff for a second halfway putting the rest of his gears into his duffel bag. He looked at Cas, a flash of hurt flicking through his eyes. "Oh, so I'm your bullet shield," Dean managed, trying hard not to let disappointment seep through his forced smirking voice, but his eyes were already glistening without permission. He really didn't know what he was expecting to hear from Cas -- that *he needed him? It wasn't like a freakin' angel would really need* him *for anything, was it?*
>
> That was when he sensed the said angel took the last step's distance he placed between them and talked into his face, slowly, quietly, one word at a time, "I need *your* help, because *you* are the only one who'll help me."
>
> The darkened eyes were so blue again when they looked into Dean's. The eyes that could express all the human language without saying a word was giving the same irresistible power, saying its own speech: *I have no one, now, Dean.* His eyes were visibly pleading, *I lost everything for you. I couldn't go back to Heaven. I was hunted. I would be killed again. I need your help, because you are the only one I have.*
>
> The angel's eyes were the sharpest blade made of broken glass, the color of glacier at the fringe of an avalanche, the shade of ocean in the eve of a storm. They were bright and dark, they were desperate and hopeful, they were bleeding and hurt, so pained and broken, yet they bored into his soul as if sprout growing from the dark and reaching desperate from a hint of sunshine through a crack. Cas looked at him, as if *he*, a mere human with no power and a broken, traumatized past, was the sunshine. Dean found himself petrified by those eyes, captured by the depth and emotions in them. He was breathless under the stare. He would do anything for him just so the bleeding pain in those eyes could stop breaking his heart.
>
> "Please," Cas finished, voice heavier than any time before.
>
> Dean swallowed, feeling his lips all the way to his throat were as dry as desert. He ran his tongue over his lips.
>
> "All right, fine," he softened, eyes lingering on the angel's lips, waiting to see the curve lifting slightly at the good news.
>
> Cas nodded appreciatively in relief, his stressed shoulders relaxed the tiniest. His eyes conveyed a quiet "Thank you" without his lips moving an inch. The curve did pull up a degree.
>
> Dean smiled fleetingly.
