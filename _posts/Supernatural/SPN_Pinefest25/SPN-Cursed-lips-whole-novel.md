# Main

## Outline

current time: 2013.5.1 (S08E21)

(main divergent from canon: bc Metatron doesn't help, Crowley killed Kevin, Metatron doesn't tell them third trial, they never figure out third trial. Sam sick but not dying)

start with meta-narrative, reading from Chuck's books: God POV, Dean/Cas pining & lips are all real and known to Metatron, canon-divergent, basically rewrite scenes from canon shows where Dean stares at Cas's lips, naturally transit to S08E21 events

background Sam bad condition after 2 trials

they find Metatron, ask for help. Metatron doesn't care about trials or Heaven/Hell, refuses to help. Instead, he's read all spn books by Chuck "Carver Edlund" and intrigued by destiel. He tricks Dean into saying he swears on Castiel's name (do you still believe in love, then swear on the person you love the most to prove you still know what love is, Dean's threatened bc desperate to save Sam? want to swear on Sam but Metatron points out he's lying to himself bc that's responsibility), curses Dean's lips just to see a good story, and threatens Dean if he doesn't kiss Cas, Sam dies; if he does, Cas loses his grace/power; and the curse can't be reversed or interfered by angel power, or Dean dies.

Dean's devastated, more repressed to keep himself away from Cas, disguise as anger on Cas even after Cas comes back to bunker after losing angel tablet (gut open by Naomi/Crowley, not recovered as quickly as he'd wish), Cas gets pushed away by Dean's pride and anger, but Dean regrets immediately when Cas's almost pushed to leave, Dean apologizes and goes soft and asks Cas to stay, confesses the curse. they'll research on reversing the curse but lower priority than finding ways to save Sam, Cas agrees to help, but also very hesitantly express he's fine to lose his power if it saves Sam, Dean refuses, Cas mistakes as Dean doesn't want them kiss, Dean knows he misunderstand but can't correct him, more torn apart. both self-torturing and painfully mistaken

Metatron annoyed at their slow pace, push them, drown Dean, Cas is forced to make choice, he kisses Dean to save him, loses his power to Metatron. Dean wakes up, more guilty and furious, "What have you done", finds Cas human now, promise they'll figure out how to fix him, but they'll stop Metatron and save Sam first

"Thank you." "Do you really think I'll let you die? I'll choose myself over you?" "I wasn't sure." "Now you do." "Does it hurt?" "Not so much, comparing to losing you."

## Chap 1 Previously On (Part One)

<!-- Meta-narrative: Metatron reads all about Dean/Cas lip-staring as in canon shows but all really happened to them, fast-forward their feelings (written in past tense, mimic Chuck's writing) -->

### Act 1 (S04E02)

> The early morning light seeped through the window blind of Bobby's place, just enough to illuminate Castiel's face. It looked almost like the angel was irradiating from inside by himself.
>
> Dean looked at that face -- with all the lines on the skin, the silhouette of his nose bridge in the thin light, the shadow it cast on his cheeks, the lips that looked always too dry, too thin, too harsh. Dean wondered how much he saw was the human vessel, and how much was the real angel.
>
> "You think of the seals as locks on a door," Castiel was saying flatly. That might be his first attempt of making an analogy -- a joke, almost -- using Dean's language, just so that the human could understand.
>
> And Dean did. He stared at the angel intensely, eyes scanning his face, searching. "Okay. Last one opens and...?"
>
> Castiel stood straight slowly, looking at him directly into his eyes and his soul. His voice was even lower than before as he leaned in closer, as if speaking it out loud would make it come true, as if he wanted to keep it a secret only between them, a taboo he wasn't supposed to share with a human but he couldn't hide it from the man before him. "Lucifer walks free."
>
> Dean's eyes widened. "Lucifer?"
>
> Castiel returned with a small nod, so small that not even the air before he was moved. Dean certainly felt the air around him was taken just by that.
>
> A gasp was forming but he swallowed it down. "I thought Lucifer was just a story they told at demon Sunday School. There's no such thing." Panic rose quickly in his chest, but he tried to press them down so hard, to appear brave, to appear a soldier like he was always trained to be. His eyes were still locked on Castiel, not blinking once. What he saw grounded him.
>
> "Three days ago, you thought there was no such thing as me," Castiel answered, almost amused. The corner of his mouth twitched ever so slightly, curving up in amusement, remembering the first time they met, the blast and the blade on his chest, the awe in the human's eyes when he looked at the shadow of his wings. He wondered if he should pull that act again, just to remind him of what he was. Hopefully it was not necessary, and that Dean could just understand, just cooperate.
>
> Dean's eyes fell onto his curled lips, lingering there for a moment too long. He remembered the exact same moment -- there was no way they had only met for three days, did they? It felt like he had known Castiel for far longer than days, or weeks, or even months. *Forty years,* he thought painfully, wincing, *how many of them did he spend watching angels coming down for him but he couldn't remember? How many of them did Castiel spend fighting all the way down to the deepest Pit to reach him, grab him, raise him, and rebuild him? He couldn't even begin to imagine.*
>
> Dean swallowed hard, feeling his tongue and lips too dry. He licked his lips.
>
> Castiel continued, his eyes never leaving Dean, not missing any move, "Why do you think we're here? Walking among you now, for the first time in two thousand years?"
>
> Dean had to pull his eyes away from those lips that were telling him horrible things -- things he never thought would possibly be real, but things that were very much happening *right now*. He could barely breath, only whispering with a hoarse voice, "To stop Lucifer." The name of the Devil gave him a shiver when it left his tongue.
>
> Castiel nodded, more firmly this time. "It's why we've arrived."
>
> Dean had to shift his look farther away, catching some air before his lung exploded. He dampened his lips again, aiming for a casual tone just to hide his panic, hoping in vain that the angel couldn't hear his heart racing in his chest. He said sarcastically, "Well, bang-up job so far. Stellar work with the Witnesses. It's nice."
>
> He leaned back on the edge of the kitchen sink, letting the cold tiles and metal calm the nerves on his lower back. He almost managed a wiggle of eyebrows even. He almost made the pretense convincing -- almost. There was no fooling for Castiel, however, who raised him, patched him, saw right through him -- but the angel was too busy defending himself from the accusation to point that out right now.
>
> "We tried," Castiel said, glancing at Dean with a light annoyance. *Who is this human to challenge his orders and Heaven's decision? He is the righteous man, and he personally saved him, but all those defiance and blasphemy was just far more annoying than necessary.* Castiel had thought more than once that this task with his human as his assignment should have been easier than fighting in Hell, but apparently, with Dean, nothing would ever be easy.
>
> Still, he told Dean, more patiently than he had ever been, "There are other battles. Other seals. Some we'll win, some we'll lose."
>
> Dean shifted his eyes again, glancing at the ceiling as if he didn't care -- even just to annoy the angel more, but even he didn't know why he'd do such thing; Castiel had been on his side so far, he didn't have much luck with supernatural beings, but this angel seemed to be an exception. *Good things do happen.* Castiel said to him the first time they met. *The good things,* Dean thought to himself, *does it include the angel standing before him, barely inches away?* He shoot those lips another look.
>
> "This one we lost." Castiel's tone turned more stern now. Dean couldn't help but scoffed again as his response -- just anything to make him look cool as cucumber, but with his heart beating like a frantic rabbit, it was getting increasingly difficult.
>
> Castiel was not pleased by that contemptuous expression. He took the last two steps between them in one stride, leaning so close into Dean's personal space to press the words into the air. Quietly, lethally angry. "Our numbers are not unlimited," he scolded, almost blaming him for the death of his brothers and the casualty in his garrison, even though both of them knew it wasn't entirely fair.
>
> Dean was cornered. It was just the space between the angel and the damned kitchen sink at Bobby's place, but he was cornered like a caged creature, with Castiel's face inches away.
>
> Dean fluttered his eyes, staring down. The lips that he noticed earlier were the first things flicked into his eyes, and he found himself unable to take his gaze away from them ever again. They flipped and flapped like butterflies, like wings of celestial creatures, like flower petals with patterns of ancient tree barks, like angel feathers he caught only a glimpse at. He wondered boldly how they would taste like and was startled by the sudden thought that came from nowhere, improper and hazardous. He wished the angel wasn't reading his mind and shoved the thought down, deep down.
>
> Castiel's voice pulled his attention back to the topic, but his lips were not helping. "Six of my brothers died in the field this week. You think the armies of Heaven should just follow you around? There's a bigger picture here."
>
> Dean swallowed again, his tongue darting out to wet his lips.
>
> Castiel leaned in even closer, his lips ghosting inches away from Dean. His tone was murderous, deadly, but Dean's mind already fell blank. He tried to avert his eyes but failed utterly. His eyes broke free of his mind's control, only focusing on the parts that were the sole thing that he could still see.
>
> Warm breath came out from between those lips and huffed onto his skin as Castiel stretched out his sentence slowly, terrifyingly, scarily, "You should show me some respect. I dragged you out of Hell. I can throw you back in."
>
> The angel didn't blink the slightest; his stare could quite literally burn a hole on Dean's face. He waited for the words to sink in.
>
> And Dean didn't breathe until he realized the angel disappeared without saying goodbye. He blinked then. *Well, that hell of a speech might be the hottest threat he'd ever heard.* He thought absently, replaying the view in his head over again, especially those eyes, that nose, that shadow and light on his face, and those lips. *He's so damned.*

### Act 2 (S04E07)

> The sun was gentle and warm for a November day. Kids were running and laughing in the playground. Dean looked at them, savoring the moment. The air beside him stirred with a light flutter of wings on the park bench. Dean didn't take his eyes away from the kids.
>
> "Let me guess. You're here for the I-told-you-so," he said nonchalantly.
>
> "No," Castiel answered simply.
>
> "Well, good," said Dean, turning halfway to the angel, "'cause I'm really not that interested." The light mood of seeing the kids playing in the park vaporized.
>
> "I'm not here to judge you, Dean," the angel said quietly, frowning slightly, turning to look at Dean.
>
> Dean realized he didn't know when he turned to face him fully, and now his gaze was fixated on Castiel's eyes again. He frowned a little, forcing his brain to focus on the conversation instead of the view. "Then why are you here?" he asked.
>
> "Our orders --" Castiel started, but immediately cut off by a fed-up Dean by saying "I've had about enough of these 'orders' of yours --" He even shot the angel a challenging look with a raised eyebrows to pull a full set of irritated look.
>
> But Castiel did not give up his speech easily. He continued as if undisturbed, staring Dean down. "Our *orders*," he gritted the word, grasping the human's attention, "were not to stop the summoning of Samhain. They were to do whatever you told us to do."
>
> Dean blinked dumbfoundedly, confused. *That can't be right.* "Your orders were to follow my orders?" He was almost amused by the idea. *Who was he to order two angels? To order angel like **Castiel** what to do?* The mere thought of that alone felt wrong. He studied the angel's face intently, hoping to see a sign of mischief, that it was a joke -- not as if he had ever found one from the angel.
>
> Castiel only nodded small. "It was a test," he told the human. "To see how you would respond under battlefield conditions, you might say." He thinned his lips, almost as if he was trying to express how much he was not particularly fond of the decision and the tests Heaven put Dean through. As if he was angry on Dean's behalf. Or empathetic. Dean watched those lips letting out the tiniest sigh, unsure of what exactly he saw there. Or why.
>
> Dean wetted his dry lips, weighing the words that were thrown onto him. "It was a witch. Not the Tet Offensive." He aimed for a light tone and a casual shrug, as if saving the life of one thousand, two hundred and fourteen people in this town wasn't such a big deal. The joke was lame, even Dean knew, the moment it left his tongue.
>
> But even Castiel allowed a small smile. Barely a facsimile of a smile, really, but the very first one closest to a smile that Dean's ever seen him. Dean found himself magnetized by it. His gaze hovered at the little curve at the tip of the angel's lips.
>
> *He was beautiful.* Dean found himself thinking, and had to bite on his lower lip to pull back that train of thoughts.
>
> Castiel didn't answer to that, only stare at the grassland before them. Dean felt the obligation of filling the moment of silence between them, as well as the space between the benches they sit on. It was no more than a foot, barely a step's distance, but it felt too far, like a gap in the universe he couldn't cross to reach the angel.
>
> Dean swallowed, forcing words to form and flow out of his throat. He took a short breath to smooth it. "So I failed your test, huh?" he started saying, thinking over what happened in the past two days, frowning deeper. "I get it. But you know what?" he paused briefly, considering his words, wetting his lips that became so quickly so dried again under the angel's eyes.
>
> Dean continued, slow but not hesitant, "If you were to wave that magic time-traveling wand of yours and we had to do it all over again? I'd make the same call." He gave Castiel a look that was saying *"I do not regret what I did. That's who I am. So deal with it."*
>
> And the angel seemed to understand. Castiel nodded quietly, waiting for Dean to finish.
>
> Dean was encouraged by the look on his face, the glistening lights in his eyes, and that ghosting hint of a smile still lingering at the corner of his lips. "'Cause I don't know what's gonna happen when these seals are broken. Hell, I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow. But what I do know is that this here --" he gestured to the playground, the joyful bright kids and people, the bright sunshine above their heads, and the grass growing under their feet, "-- these kids, the swings, the trees... All of it is still here because of my brother and me." He reasoned, but the angel wasn't the only one he tried to persuade. *Did he really miss the "bigger picture" like the angels told him? Did he just make another mistake like all the other mistakes in their life, and condemned six billion human beings because he wasn't willing to sacrifice one thousand?* Dean looked at the angel, wondering what Castiel really thought of his decision, more importantly, what he thought of *him* now.
>
> Castiel turned fully to Dean, his face heavy with all the compassion and empathy. His eyes returned Dean's gaze, holding him there, anchoring him. There was no disapproval or disappointment in those blue eyes, only understanding, with a sprinkle of pain. "You misunderstand me, Dean," the angel said slowly. "I'm not like you think. I was *praying* that you would choose to save the town."
>
> Dean was surprised. "You were?" That was something he didn't dare to have hope for, but Castiel surprised him nonetheless.
>
> "These people, they are all my Father's creations. They are works of art." His gaze flashed to the people in park briefly before landing back on Dean. *Including you, Dean,* his eyes were saying quietly, *you are the best of all those creations and the most beautiful works of art.* The emotions stirred in those eyes like ripples in a lake, swirling darker.
>
> Dean winced under those eyes, unsure of what he read, uneased by the look of appreciation and other things that were too kind to be real because he was damn sure he didn't deserve them. He lowered his gaze, drifting down to the angel's mouth. It was as dry and parched as all those other times he saw. Dean ran his tongue over his lips, as if it could wet the lips in his view.
>
> "And yet, even though you stopped Samhain, the seal was broken," Castiel was still speaking. His face hardened. "And we are one step closer to Hell on Earth for all creation. And that's not an expression, Dean. It's literal. You, of all people, should appreciate what that means."
>
> Panic flickered through him like an electric wave of shock. Dean took a shallow breath, and felt his chest too tight to let that sigh out. *If the Armageddon fell on Earth, couldn't say he wasn't warned. And he would know, with all the pain and consequence for all the eternity, it might just because of the mistake they made today, because he wouldn't let a town and a thousand people die -- even knowing that, he still wouldn't.*
>
> He looked at the angel, thinking, asking silently, *What should I do, Cas?* For once, without saying it out loud, Dean thought, he was properly scared. Less scared than when he watched Sam die in his arms, more scared than when he was dragged to Hell by a Hellhound. *How do I make the right choice? If you have the answer, please tell me.*
>
> And as if heard the voice in his mind, Castiel said, more quietly than before, frowning deeper than before, "Can I tell you something if you promise not to tell another soul?" His tone was so careful, so trusting, that Dean swallowed again around the lump in his throat.
>
> "Okay," he squeezed the voice out.
>
> "I'm not a 'hammer,' as you say," the angel confessed, his eyes averted, staring at his own clenched hands. "I have questions. I have doubts." He glanced at the sky, at Heaven's direction, and he looked away, as if he couldn't even bear to think about Heaven for too long at this moment, as if he was ashamed.
>
> Dean watched him intently, capturing every move of his eyes, every quiver of his lips. He didn't know the pain and uncertainty he witnessed, if they were the reflection of his or Castiel's. Perhaps both.
>
> And the confession stretched on. "I don't know what is right and what is wrong anymore. Whether you passed or failed here." They shared another glance, then another stare. "But in the coming months you will have more decisions to make. I don't envy the weight that's on your shoulders, Dean. I truly don't."
>
> Dean clenched his jaw at that, rendered breathless by the knowledge and burden in Castiel's eyes and voice. *But at least I got you here with me, right?* He thought, not daring to say that out. *He felt too small and too big at the same time. They were talking about Apocalypse and Heaven and Hell and Angel and Demon here, and how could him, a vanilla human (okay, maybe adding a bit spice and juice) get to play on this big chessboard?* Even just talking with angels, with Castiel, still made his stomach flutter.
>
> Dean looked at the angel -- really looked at him -- thinking of the celestial being resided inside this vessel, behind the cloth and flesh, behind those lines and curves on his face, behind those eyes and lips, the being that could destroy him within a blink. And yet, at the same time, Castiel was just sitting on a park bench with him, looking nothing different from a human, telling him, even as an angel, "he wasn't a hammer," telling him things that he wouldn't share with any other soul except for Dean.
>
> So here they were, on the park bench, under the sunshine of a November morning, staring at each other, long and quiet, both thinking dazedly: *The person sitting with them was so unbelievable* and *They are going to be so screwed*.

<p style="text-align:right">-- <i>"Supernatural: It's the Great Pumpkin, Sam"</i> (2008) by Carver Edlund</p>

### Act 3 (S04E22)

> Dean frantically paced in the Beautiful Room, pissed and caged. The echo of their last fight lingered in his mind, sounding way too loud to his ears in this fancy angelic place that didn't have much sound except for his own footsteps. He shattered the little white angel statue to the floor just to hear the sound of cracking. And within a blink, it looked the exact same again, standing on the edge of the high-end marble display desk. Cas didn't appear this time.
>
> *What is so worth saving? I see nothing but pain here. I see inside you. I see your guilt, your anger, confusion.*
>
> *There is a right and there is a wrong here, and you know it!*
>
> *What would you have me do?*
>
> *I do that, we'll all be hunted. We'll all be killed.*
>
> *If there is anything worth dying for, this is it.*
>
> The look on Cas's face at that moment haunted him. Dean closed his eyes and still couldn't unsee it -- a moment of hope, a beat of silence, a moment of understanding. *Maybe Cas would help,* he remembered thinking then. That deeply, deeply troubled look, the struggle, the pain, the torn-apart, the guilt, the apologies. But it wasn't enough.
>
> Dean let out a long sigh, pressing the heels of his palms into his eye sockets. He'd die for his family and friends in a heartbeat, and he really thought they were that -- family and friends. Cas helped so much in the past year, Cas *saved* him from Hell, and it shouldn't mean nothing.
>
> Yet still, here they were, parting on bad terms. It didn't matter that even Cas had said, "We've been through much together, you and I." Spending a year together saving the world didn't stand a chance against the brainwash of Heaven's lecture, it seemed.
>
> Dean started pacing again. The disappointment and hurt receded slowly in the quietness and emptiness in the room. Memory came to him like rising waves. He remembered the time when Cas told him "Just so you understand why I can't help" with that wary look on his eyes when all he did was to help him, when Cas came back from Bible Camp and saved them from demons, but the first sentence coming out of him was "I serve Heaven, I don't serve man, and I certainly don't serve you."
>
> "What happened in the Bible Camp, really, Cas?" Dean stared at one of the wall paintings that had Michael slaying a big ugly dragon with long horns and tail, but he decidedly not looking into it too closely. Instead, he sent a quiet and desperate prayer. That's the only thing he was left to do in here anyway. "You helped me more than once -- Hell, you helped me every time, whenever I needed you. I was so sure you were my friend, Cas. I'm still trying to believe it. I don't have many of them, and most of them are dead. But please tell me I'm not wrong, that whatever's happening, I could at least still have you."
>
> The room was still too quiet, too static, too dead, too fake. Everything was too fake in here, the overbright gallery light, the arts, the paintings, the beer and burgers.
>
> Dean turned around, standing at the edge of the table, staring at the food and drink basin but not really looking. Through his mind, in his prayer, he sent more than words now: he sent over the feelings and memories and images. The chilling thrill when he realized he was still alive, the joy of life after leaving Hell; the night when they met in the barn and he saw Cas's wings, the beauty of an angel that he was too frightened to believe it was true; the day they saved a town when the Destiny decided a different, more horrible fate for all the people and kids in there, the first small smile on Cas's face, the exchange of words and confessions; when he couldn't stand to watch the demon kicking his ass, choking him down, and speaking angel exorcism, that's why he picked up a crowbar and slammed it onto Alastair's head, even when the whole plan was to let angels and demons tear each other apart, he just couldn't bare to see Cas suffer like that; and so many times they looked into each other's eyes, when they shared a quiet comfortable moment, the quiet understanding and alliance.
>
> "Cas," Dean's lips quivered. He could barely hear his own words. It was getting teary. Desperate. He took a long breath in, trying vainly to steady himself. He tried again, "Cas, listen to me. I'm not mad at you, Hell, I'm more mad at myself most of the times. And I know I'm asking a lot, alright? I know. But I have to ask. You told me to have faith, and this is me having faith in you. You said to me 'Good things do happen', and you know what? I believe you, and I think that's you -- I couldn't remember most things happening between seventeen and twenty-nine, but I remember every single moment from this past year -- you were the best thing happened to me in my whole life, did I ever tell you that? And I think -- I hope -- I could just have that a little longer. Cas, you hear me?"
>
> He waited for two more seconds, listening to any flutter in the air. And he heard nothing.
>
> "Son of a bitch," Dean murmured, closing his eyes miserably.
>
> He lost. He lost his bet, he lost his only friend, and they lost the world, everything. It was over.
>
> He opened his eyes again, and the basin full of burgers and beers was the first thing came into view.
>
> He sighed, long and defeated. *What the Hell. He's gonna die any time anyway. Might as well go with the swing.*
>
> Dean grabbed a paper-wrapped burger, ready to take a bite.
>
> That was when he heard the sound of the wings again, disturbing the air behind him. Dean didn't even have enough time to turn his head when the hand on his shoulder abruptly spined him around and slammed him back into the nearest pillar.
>
> Castiel cupped his hand over Dean's mouth, the other hand reaching into the trench coat to pull the demon knife.
>
> Dean was panicked for a second, struggling under Castiel's hand for a second, before their eyes lock. One look, and he calmed down.
>
> Cas's eyes were vigilant and steady, not blinking when he stared into Dean's eyes, all the way boring into his soul.
>
> Dean didn't need words to hear him. Cas was saying *Are you ready? Do you trust me? This is me choosing you against Heaven. We're going to die. And I'm ready to die for you. Is this what you want?*
>
> One look, and Dean's heart ceased to beat, but then he nodded. Soundless, but certain, he nodded. *I trust you.* He answered with his eyes and thoughts. *I trust you with my life and my brother's. I'm ready. Do it.*
>
> Cas released him, and Dean staggered away from the wall two steps. Cas started drawing back his trench coat sleeve, cutting his own arm with the knife. The cut was so deep that it might drain half the blood in his body within minutes; blood gurgling out from the gash, and Cas didn't pay any attention. He started drawing a huge angel banishing sigil on the closest wall. Dean watched him dipping two-knuckle deep into the cut to draw the sigil, wincing at the empathetic pain of knowing how much it must hurt to a human body. Blood streaming down to the floor, pooling rapidly into a puddle, and Cas didn't give it a damn.
>
> Dean swallowed and licked his lips. *The end is right here*, Dean thought to himself, *they do this, they could all die tonight, and this might be the last time they see each other.*
>
> Dean drew his gaze all the way over Castiel, head to tail, top to bottom, from the crinkles between his eyebrows to the curve of his lips. He would like to save an image of the angel to remember at the moment of his inevitably coming death.
>
> *Thank you.* Dean thought, sending it through the prayer.
>
> That was before Zachariah barged into the Beautiful Room.

## Chap 1 Previously On (Part Two)

### Act 4 (S05E03)

> Dean jumped when Cas's reflection popped into the mirror, barely inches away. His heartbeat raced like a frantic rabbit for a hot minute, and he could still feel his temples throbbing when he lashed out: "God! Don't do that!"
>
> He thumped the sink.
>
> The angel didn't seem to realize the problem, merely frowned slightly at his reflection, and answered with his classic opening flatly with his deep voice: "Hello, Dean."
>
> Dean pivoted from the place by the sink where he was cleaning the bloodstains on his favorite green jacket with a damped washcloth. And there he was, Cas -- the miraculously resurrected angel of Thursday, living for eons and not understanding a thing of delicate human social rules -- standing less than half a foot away from him. His lips less than three inches.
>
> Dean couldn't help his eyes flickering downward, attracted by them incorrigibly. His brain put up a pretended war, forcing his eyes moving up, lingering on the angel's eyes instead. Those eyes were too hot to stare at in this distance. Dean could practically feel the heat from his body and the flow of air from his breath. *It's too close. It's way too close.*
>
> Dean's eyes gave up the fight, moving down to the lips that were split with a small slit. Five o'clock stubble sprinkled across his lips.
>
> Dean had to use all his brain power to tear his eyes away. He spoke, but the words coming out in a whisper as if he was incapable of talking any louder when the angel stood this close to him. He whispered, "Cas, we've talked about this. Personal space?"
>
> Cas narrowed his eyes in confusion for a split second, eyes searching on the human's face. *What an annoying race with all the complicating rules.* But walking the Earth for little over a year, he did learn to pick up a thing or two on human emotions and facial expressions. And right now, he read "uneasy" on Dean's face, which was usually one step away from anger.
>
> Cas took a step back quickly. "My apologies." He lowered his eyes, a look of obedience.
>
> Dean threw him a quick glance, grabbed his jacket, and walked past the angel toward the bed. "How did you find me? I thought I was flying below the angel radar." He gestured at his ribs to illustrate the point. He wouldn't ever forget the hilariously startled and confused looks on the faces of x-ray technicians and then the doctors. He'd find it humorous too if he's not the one being carved. *Just how much imprints do Castiel have to leave on him? First with the handprint on his shoulder, then the rib carve. That's a possessive son of a bitch. Not like he owned him.* He found himself thinking, and the thought somewhat took a nosedive from unsettling to unbelievably erotic within merely a second. He swallowed the thought down.
>
> "You are." Cas confirmed his point, "Bobby told me where you were."
>
> *Traitor.* Dean thought, huffing out a quiet laugh.
>
> The angel didn't seem to notice, for he was busy scanning through the empty motel room, with one ruffled single bed and one duffle bag on the floor. No sign of the second brother.
>
> "Where's Sam?" Cas asked with a serious, growing frown.
>
> It was an easy topic and Dean really, really didn't want to have that discussion with the angel at this moment. He took a minute before answering, as nonchalantly as he could manage, "Me and Sam are taking separate vacations for a while." He put on his jacket as if it was a layer of armor he could protect himself with. Cas observed him quietly from two steps away, not commenting.
>
> "So." Dean pressed, eager to switch the topic. He sorted out the collar of the newly put-on jacket, turning to the angel with pointed eyes. "Did you find Got yet? More importantly, can I have my damn necklace back, please?" He almost felt compelled to let Cas know how that necklace never left him ever since twelve when he put it on for the first time. He didn't know what get the better of him to agree giving Cas that amulet, maybe that was the tone Cas told him "I lost everything for you, for nothing," or the fierce but broken look in his eyes. He just couldn't refuse at that time. And now it was almost like his brain and his body were all itching to have it back at the first chance.
>
> "No, I haven't found him." Cas answered matter-of-factly, tilting his chin mildly, meeting his eyes straightly. "That's why I'm here. I need your help."
>
> Dean busied himself with rolling his sleeves up so he wouldn't need to return the looks he knew Castiel was throwing at him. "With what? God hunt?" he murmured, semi-amused at the idea. "Not interested." It was easier to say no when he didn't have to meet Cas in the eyes, he learned his lesson by now.
>
> The rejection made Cas turn his head away, staring at the disorganized interior of the motel room. "It's not God. It's someone else." Worry started growing inside him. *He needed Dean*, the angel thought, despite his pride. But the human didn't seem to realize how big of a deal this was. Dean didn't change a bit since last year about how annoying he could get to, even if he might eventually agree on something, it would never be an easy persuasion.
>
> Cas's tone made Dean look up, fixing him with a more serious look. He paused a beat, knowing he'd regret asking but it was also so obvious Cas was trouble. Dean asked, "Who?"
>
> "It's an Archangel." Cas told him, getting increasingly more worried as he spoke, taking steps to shorten the three steps' distance between them until he stood right before Dean again, disregarding the personal space. "The one who killed me." Dean didn't know the exact details of his death, the moment when the Archangel's light falling onto him, the moment he stood in the prophet's house facing that dawning light, knowing without doubt that he'd be annihilated without a flesh from his vessel or a thread of light from his Grace. It was so instant that there was no pain or fear. His mind was on Dean at that moment, knowing he was doing the right thing, that they were saving the world, together and off-script. He was free, and a little fluttering in his heart. He would never tell Dean any of it.
>
> Dean watched him intently from six inches away, arching his eyebrows. "Excuse me?" People don't usually talk about their killers so lightly -- well, *people* don't usually come back after they were killed and then talking about the ones killed them with a flat tone and a minor frown. They still didn't know how Cas came back -- not that Dean complained about that particular miracle though, he just wondered who he should send a card and flower bouquet to.
>
> The muscle on Cas's cheekbone twitched with a ghost of emotion -- not hatred, exactly, more like a mild disaffection and displeasure.  "His name is Raphael," he told Dean.
>
> Dean raised his amused eyebrows higher and lowered his voice, stifling a muted laugh, "You were wasted by a teenage mutant ninja angel?"
>
> It must be one of Dean's usual culture reference that Castiel didn't have the patience to indulge or even just humor him with a look of confusion -- he knew how much Dean just enjoyed watching him tilt his head in confusion whenever he thought he came up with something clever and knew Cas wouldn't understand. For whatever reason, it seemed to give Dean some sense of joy or satisfaction. But today wasn't one of these days, the matter was too urgent, so Cas didn't indulge him today. Instead, he cut right back to the tricky problem by hand. "I've heard whispers that he's walking the earth. This is a rare opportunity."
>
> Dean regarded him carefully. "For what? Revenge?"
>
> "Information," the angel corrected him flatly.
>
> Dean huffed a small laugh, shifting his eyes away. "So you think if you find this dud, he's just gonna spill God's address?" He kept his tone light, and walked past Cas, went to pick up his knife and washcloth from the sink.
>
> Cas didn't turn around. "Yes," he said stoically, the plan was already there, he just needed Dean to help, to cooperate. He panned out the plan, "because we are gonna trap him and interrogate him."
>
> Dean paused on the work in his hand that was halfway cleaning his knife, and turned back at him. "You're serious about this." The lightness vanished from his voice.
>
> Castiel turned around to face him. His face dead serious. His eyes were as steady and... deadly (which was just another term for suicidal in his case, in Dean's mind) as the day he pushed Dean to the wall of the Beautiful Room before cutting his arm open for the sigil. And Dean recognized it with a shiver through his spine.
>
> "Yes," Cas pronounced simply.
>
> Dean let go of the washcloth in his hand, stepping toward the angel slowly, with the freshly cleaned blade waving in his right hand. His gut twisted, Dean realized, but he didn't know why. It must be the way Cas stared at him right this moment, the same heated look before his eyes asking *Do you trust me? I'm ready to die for you. Is this what you want?* And Dean didn't have a second to pause and really think it over before answering with a nod, before realizing the meaning of his nod.
>
> That day, he could have died -- he should have; Sam could have died; and Cas actually died, before all of them were magically brought back to life. He nodded at that time, telling Cas (without himself really knowing what he's asking, or rather, he did, but he didn't want to think about it too hard) *Go, die for me.*
>
> Dean paused before Cas, frowning with disbelief. *Is today a replay of that again? Are they going to die for some big bullshit cause again?* He thought, and he didn't have to ask to know the answer. It was the same look, same whirling shadow in his dark eyes. Cas's blue eyes were almost black now, and the lines on his face were tightened. His lips thinned to a line.
>
> Dean's eyes flickered across his face, treading through his eyes to his lips, and he had to force out a laugh to release the weight on his chest before he was able to speak again. Dean heard himself saying, "So what, I'm Thelma and you're Louise, and we're just gonna hold hands and sail off this cliff together?" His mind decidedly *not* wandered to the fact that *Thelma and Louise*, if anything, was probably *the* most classic road movie with same-gender characters that were most definitely *not* having romantic feelings with one another. It was just a story with two people dying together at the end of a long and fucked trip -- exactly what they were, weren't they?
>
> Cas just stared at him, frowning in aching confusion. Dean didn't know what he was waiting for exactly.
>
> He shut his eyes for a long second and let out an exhausted exhale, walking away from the angel to put his knife into his half-sorted duffel bag. "Give me one good reason why I should do this." He chose to say instead, his back to Cas. It was not a rejection per say, but close enough.
>
> Cas turned to him. "Because you're Michael's vessel and no angel will dare harm you," he answered dutifully. The strategic reason might be the easiest to pass for "one good reason" to persuade Dean, Cas reasoned quietly.
>
> Dean was stiff for a second halfway putting the rest of his gears into his duffel bag. He looked at Cas, a flash of hurt flicking through his eyes. "Oh, so I'm your bullet shield," Dean managed, trying hard not to let disappointment seep through his forced smirking voice, but his eyes were already glistening without permission. He really didn't know what he was expecting to hear from Cas -- that *he needed him? It wasn't like a freakin' angel would really need* him *for anything, was it?*
>
> That was when he sensed the said angel took the last step's distance he placed between them and talked into his face, slowly, quietly, one word at a time, "I need *your* help, because *you* are the only one who'll help me."
>
> The darkened eyes were so blue again when they looked into Dean's. The eyes that could express all the human language without saying a word was giving the same irresistible power, saying its own speech: *I have no one, now, Dean.* His eyes were visibly pleading, *I lost everything for you. I couldn't go back to Heaven. I was hunted. I would be killed again. I need your help, because you are the only one I have.*
>
> The angel's eyes were the sharpest blade made of broken glass, the color of glacier at the fringe of an avalanche, the shade of ocean in the eve of a storm. They were bright and dark, they were desperate and hopeful, they were bleeding and hurt, so pained and broken, yet they bored into his soul as if sprout growing from the dark and reaching desperate from a hint of sunshine through a crack. Cas looked at him, as if *he*, a mere human with no power and a broken, traumatized past, was the sunshine. Dean found himself petrified by those eyes, captured by the depth and emotions in them. He was breathless under the stare. He would do anything for him just so the bleeding pain in those eyes could stop breaking his heart.
>
> "Please," Cas finished, voice heavier than any time before.
>
> Dean swallowed, feeling his lips all the way to his throat were as dry as desert. He ran his tongue over his lips.
>
> "All right, fine," he softened, eyes lingering on the angel's lips, waiting to see the curve lifting slightly at the good news.
>
> Cas nodded appreciatively in relief, his stressed shoulders relaxed the tiniest. His eyes conveyed a quiet "Thank you" without his lips moving an inch. The curve did pull up a degree.
>
> Dean smiled fleetingly.

Metatron throws the last book (*Pac-Man Fever*) into the pile that he just finished, and sighs with relief that it's the last one of the whole series, published and unpublished. No more torture to continue reading more of that crap. It's just frustrating to keep reading the same thing over and over and over again -- those same two morons doing the same thing for *four freaking years* without making *any* progress? It's really not a good story. It wouldn't even crack the top ten thousand of the metric ton of books he's read in his lifetime just for that fact alone.

If *he* is the writer, he has so many more ideas for them.

He would make it a better story.
