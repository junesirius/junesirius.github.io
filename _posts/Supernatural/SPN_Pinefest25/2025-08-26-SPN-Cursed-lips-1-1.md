> The early morning light seeped through the window blind of Bobby's place, just enough to illuminate Castiel's face. It looked almost like the angel was irradiating from inside by himself.
>
> Dean looked at that face -- with all the lines on the skin, the silhouette of his nose bridge in the thin light, the shadow it cast on his cheeks, the lips that looked always too dry, too thin, too harsh. Dean wondered how much he saw was the human vessel, and how much was the real angel.
>
> "You think of the seals as locks on a door," Castiel was saying flatly. That might be his first attempt of making an analogy -- a joke, almost -- using Dean's language, just so that the human could understand.
>
> And Dean did. He stared at the angel intensely, eyes scanning his face, searching. "Okay. Last one opens and...?"
>
> Castiel stood straight slowly, looking at him directly into his eyes, his soul. His voice was even lower than before as he leaned in closer, as if speaking it out loud would make it come true, as if he wanted to keep it a secret only between them, a taboo he wasn't supposed to share with a human but he couldn't hide it from the man before him. "Lucifer walks free."
>
> Dean's eyes widened. "Lucifer?"
>
> Castiel returned with a small nod, so small that not even the air before he was moved. Dean certainly felt the air around him was taken just by that.
>
> A gasp was forming but he swallowed it down. "I thought Lucifer was just a story they told at demon Sunday School. There's no such thing." Panic rose quickly in his chest, but he tried to press them down so hard, to appear brave, to appear a soldier like he was always trained to be. His eyes were still locked on Castiel, not blinking once. What he saw grounded him.
>
> "Three days ago, you thought there was no such thing as me," Castiel answered, almost amused. The corner of his mouth twitched ever so slightly, curving up in amusement, remembering the first time they met, the blast and blade on his chest, the awe in the human's eyes when he looked at the shadow of his wings. He wondered if he should pull that act again, just to remind him of what he was. Hopefully it was not necessary, and that Dean could just understand, just cooperate.
>
> Dean's eyes fell onto his curled lips, lingering there for a moment too long. He remembered the exact same moment -- there was no way they had only met for three days, did they? It felt like he had known Castiel for far longer than days, or weeks, or even months. *Forty years,* he thought painfully, wincing, *how many of them did he spend watching angels coming down for him but he couldn't remember? How many of them did Castiel spend fighting all the way down to the deepest Pit to reach him, grab him, raise him, and rebuild him? He couldn't even begin to imagine.*
>
> Dean swallowed hard, feeling his tongue and lips too dry. He licked his lips.
>
> Castiel continued, his eyes never leaving Dean, not missing any move, "Why do you think we're here? Walking among you now, for the first time in two thousand years?"
>
> Dean had to pull his eyes away from those lips that were telling him horrible things -- things he never thought would possibly be real, but things that were very much happening *right now*. He could barely breath, only whispering with a hoarse voice, "To stop Lucifer." The name of the Devil gave him a shiver when it left his tongue.
>
> Castiel nodded, more firmly this time. "It's why we've arrived."
>
> Dean had to shift his look farther away, catching some air before his lung exploded. He dampened his lips again, aiming for a casual tone just to hide his panic, hoping in vain that the angel couldn't hear his heart racing in his chest. He said sarcastically, "Well, bang-up job so far. Stellar work with the Witnesses. It's nice."
>
> He leaned back on the edge of the kitchen sink, letting the cold tiles and metal calm the nerves on his lower back. He almost managed a wiggle of eyebrows even. He almost made the pretense convincing -- almost. There was no fooling for Castiel, however, who raised him, patched him, saw right through him -- but the angel was too busy defending himself from the accusation to point that out right now.
>
> "We tried," Castiel said, glancing at Dean with a light annoyance. *Who is this human to challenge his orders and Heaven's decision? He's the righteous man, sure. And he personally saved him, but all those defiance and blasphemy was just annoying.* Castiel had thought more than once that this task with his human as his assignment should have been easier than fighting in Hell, but apparently, with Dean, nothing would ever be easy.
>
> Still, he told Dean, more patiently than he'd ever be, "There are other battles. Other seals. Some we'll win, some we'll lose."
>
> Dean shifted his eyes again, glancing at the ceiling as if he didn't care -- even just to annoy the angel more, but even he didn't know why he'd do such thing; Castiel had been on his side so far, he didn't have much luck with supernatural beings, but he seemed to be an exception. *Good things do happen.* Castiel said to him the first time they met. *The good things,* Dean thought to himself, *does it include the angel standing before him, barely inches away?* He shoot those lips another look.
>
> "This one we lost." Castiel's tone turned more stern now. Dean couldn't help but scoffed again as his response -- just anything to make him look cool as cucumber, but with his heart beating like a frantic rabbit, it was getting increasingly difficult.
>
> Castiel was not pleased by that contemptuous expression. He took the last two steps between them in one stride, leaning so close into Dean's personal space to press the words into the air. Quietly, lethally angry. "Our numbers are not unlimited," he scolded, almost blaming him for the death of his brothers and the casualty in his garrison, even though he knew it wasn't entirely fair.
>
> Dean was cornered. It was just the space between the angel and the damned kitchen sink at Bobby's place, but he was cornered like a caged creature, with Castiel's face inches away.
>
> Dean fluttered his eyes, staring down. The lips that he noticed earlier were the first things flicked into his eyes, and he found himself unable to take his gaze away from them ever again. They flipped and flapped like butterflies, like wings of celestial creatures, like flower petals with patterns of ancient tree barks, like angel feathers he caught only a glimpse at. He wondered boldly how they would taste like and was startled by the sudden thought that came from nowhere, improper and hazardous. He wished the angel wasn't reading his mind and shoved the thought down, deep down.
>
> Castiel's voice pulled his attention back to the topic, but his lips were not helping. "Six of my brothers died in the field this week. You think the armies of Heaven should just follow you around? There's a bigger picture here."
>
> Dean swallowed again, his tongue darting out to wet his lips.
>
> Castiel leaned in even closer, his lips ghosting inches away from Dean. His tone was murderous, deadly, but Dean's mind already fell blank. He tried to avert his eyes but failed utterly. His eyes broke free of his mind's control, only focusing on the parts that were the sole thing that he could still see.
>
> Warm breath came out from between those lips and huffed onto his skin as Castiel stretched out his sentence slowly, terrifyingly, scarily, "You should show me some respect. I dragged you out of Hell. I can throw you back in."
>
> The angel didn't blink the slightest; his stare could quite literally burn a hole on Dean's face. He waited for the words to sink in.
>
> And Dean didn't breathe until he realized the angel disappeared without saying goodbye. He blinked then. *Well, that hell of a speech might be the hottest threat he'd ever heard.* He thought absently, replaying the view in his head over again, especially those eyes, that nose, that shadow and light on his face, and those lips. *He's so damned.*
