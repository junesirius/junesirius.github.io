> Dean frantically paced in the Beautiful Room, pissed and caged. The echo of their last fight lingered in his mind, sounding way too loud to his ears in this fancy angelic place that didn't have much sound except for his own footsteps. He shattered the little white angel statue to the floor just to hear the sound of cracking. And within blink, it looked the exact same again, standing on the edge of some fancy display desk. Cas didn't appear this time.
>
> *What is so worth saving? I see nothing but pain here. I see inside you. I see your guilt, your anger, confusion.*
>
> *There is a right and there is a wrong here, and you know it!*
>
> *What would you have me do?*
>
> *I do that, we'll all be hunted. We'll all be killed.*
>
> *If there is anything worth dying for, this is it.*
>
> The look on Cas's face at that moment haunted him. Dean closed his eyes and still couldn't unsee it -- a moment of hope, a beat of silence, a moment of understanding. *Maybe Cas would help,* he remembered thinking then. That deeply, deeply troubled look, the struggle, the pain, the torn-apart, the guilt, the apologies. But it wasn't enough.
>
> Dean let out a long sigh, pressing the heels of his palm into his eye sockets. He'd die for his family and friends in a heartbeat, and he really thought they were that -- family and friends. Cas helped so much in the past year, Cas *saved* him from Hell, and it shouldn't mean nothing.
>
> Dean started pacing again. The disappointment and hurt receded slowly in the quietness and emptiness in the room. Memory came to him like rising waves. He remembered the time when Cas told him "Just so you understand why I can't help" with that wary look on his eyes when all he did was to help him, when Cas came back from Bible Camp and saved them from demons, but the first sentence coming out of him was "I serve Heaven, I don't serve man, and I certainly don't serve you."
>
> "What happened in the Bible Camp, really, Cas?" Dean stared at one of the wall paintings that had Michael slaying a big ugly dragon, but he decidedly not looking into it too closely. Instead, he sent a quiet and desperate prayer. That's the only thing he was left to do in here anyway. "You helped me more than once -- Hell, you helped me every time, whenever I needed you. I was so sure you were my friend, Cas. I'm still trying to believe it. I don't have many of them, and most of them are dead. But please tell me I'm not wrong, that I could at least still have you."
>
> The room was still too quiet, too static, too dead, too fake. Everything was too fake in here, the overbright gallery light, the arts, the paintings, the beer and burgers.
>
> Dean turned around, standing at the edge of the table, staring at the food and drinks but not really looking. Through his mind, in his prayer, he sent more than words now: he sent over the feelings and memories and images. The chilling thrill when he realized he was alive, the joy of life; the night when they met in the barn and he saw Cas's wings, the beauty of an angel that he was too frightened to believe it was true; the day they saved a town when the Destiny decided a different, more horrible fate for all the people and kids in there, the first small smile on Cas's face, the exchange of words and confessions; and so many times they looked into each other's eyes.
>
> "Cas," Dean's lips quivered. He could barely hear his own words. It was getting teary. Desperate. He took a long breath in, trying vainly to steady himself. He tried again, "Cas, listen to me. I'm not mad at you, Hell, I'm more mad at myself most of the times. And I know I'm asking a lot, alright? I know. But I have to ask. You told me to have faith, and this is me having faith in you. You said to me 'Good things do happen', and you know what? I believed you, and I think that's you -- I couldn't remember most things happening between seventeen and twenty-nine, but I remember every single moment from this past year -- you were the best thing happened to me in my whole life, did I ever tell you that? And I think -- I hope -- I could just have that a little longer. Cas, you hear me?"
>
> That was when he heard the sound of the wings again, disturbing the air behind him. Dean didn't even have enough time to turn his head when the hand on his shoulder abruptly spined him around and slammed him back into the nearby pillar.
>
> Castiel cupped his hand over Dean's mouth, the other hand reaching into the trench coat to pull the demon knife.
>
> Dean was panicked for a second, struggling under Cas's hand for a second, before their eyes lock. One look, and he calmed down.
>
> Cas's eyes were vigilant and steady, not blinking when he stared into Dean's eyes, all the way boring into his souls.
>
> Dean didn't need words to hear him. Cas was saying *Are you ready? Do you trust me? This is me choosing you. And I'm ready to die for you.*
>
> One look, and Dean's heart ceased to beat, but then he nodded. Soundless, but certain, he nodded. *I trust you.* He answered with his eyes and thoughts. *I trust you with my life and my brother's. I'm ready. Do it.*
>
> Cas released him, and Dean staggered back two steps. Cas started drawing back his trench coat sleeve, cutting his own arm with the knife, and drawing a huge angel banishing sigil on the closest wall. Dean watched him dipping two-knuckle deep into the cut to draw the sigil, blood streaming down to the floor, and Cas didn't give it a damn.
>
> Dean swallowed and licked his lips. *The end is right here*, Dean thought to himself, *they do this, they could all die tonight, and this might be the last time they see each other.*
>
> Dean drew his gaze all the way over Castiel, head to tail, top to bottom, from the crinkles between his eyebrows to the curve of his lips. He would like to save an image to remember for his inevitable coming death.
>
> *Thank you.* Dean thought, sending it through the prayer.
>
> That was before Zachariah barged into the Beautiful Room.
