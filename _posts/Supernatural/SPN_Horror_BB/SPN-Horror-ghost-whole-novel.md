## Main

### Act 1 (Chapter 1)

> Dean recently moves into the town, get the new job, move into the new apartment, only to find it haunted -> Dean a bit on edge and freaked out (horror/suspension elements)

"The place is good enough, close to the office, good view, but no compete with California of course," Dean talks on the phone, pacing in front of the large floor-to-ceiling window that has the view of a running river right down below. The penthouse view. "But at least the rent is decent -- not crazy, in this economy -- says a lot already."

"Not like you need to worry about the rent." Jo laughs on the other side of the line. "Why don't you just buy it?"

"Hey, money is money. Think of it as probationary period." Dean paces back to the kitchen, grabbing the bottle of Master Cleanse and drinking a gulp. The taste still makes him frown, but at lease it's good for health.

"Like all businessmen say."

"Yeah why am I not surprised, the whole industry says that -- hell, the whole world says that, that's how we make money, am I right?" He grins into the phone.

"I wouldn't know." Jo's voice unimpressed. "Not like I'm going to be business major or anything."

"How's school? Everything okay there?" Dean's voice gets more straight now, dropping the teasing tone.

"Why, if I get bullied, you'll dash in here kicking their asses?"

"I might worry more about the other guy, you know, call an ambulance before you kill them or do something worse."

"Am I that bad?"

"You've been hitting dudes in the nose since like twelve, Jo. I would know."

"That's because they're all jerks."

"No argument there, but still, I got to look out for my little sister."

Jo snorts a laugh. "Bye Dean. Oh and, mom and dad said congrats on your new job."

Dean raises his eyebrows. "There's no shame to congratulate me yourself, you know."

"Oh I know." Jo chuckles, hanging up the phone.

*What a pain in the ass.* Dean amuses, putting the phone back into the pocket, walking back to the center of the living room.

The place was furnitured when he moved in, the sofa, the TV stand, the bed, all included and in good shape. And not the cheap stuff, he can tell.

He's actually impressed with everything and the view, the rent should at least go double or triple. He has asked the renting company about the reason why, but all he gets is a big vague "You find a good deal" as if they suddenly take an interest in the charity.

There is no such thing as free lunch in the business, and no one would let go of free money, so he did have suspicion. But after inspecting the place for three rounds, there is still no problem he can find, the building structure is compliant, the renting contract is legit, he even has his lawyer going through the lines and there is nothing suspicious. "Guess it really is a good deal then." His lawyer told him.

So he moved in. Not with many possessions, just a number of boxes with some clothes and books that can fit into his Prius. He's here, new job, new place, new life ahead. Fresh start.

Dean Smith feels good about the life.

<br>

*Probably just because it's the first night, in a new room, on a new bed.* Dean tells himself, trying the yoga breathing.

He's still turning and rolling over in the middle of the night, feeling uneasy.

He opens up eyes, staring at the ceiling. The alarm clock on the bedstand shows around two now. He only has another four hours before having to get up for the first day in office. He wouldn't want to be late for the first day.

The sleepiness is there, hiding behind the eyelids, he can feel it, his head and eyes heavy from the usual biological clock, but something is disturbing his gut. The feeling of being watched by something unseen in the dark.

Dean forces his eyes widen, trying to scan the room. There is nothing there, of course. The quiet night. So quiet he thinks he can even imagine neighbor's light snoring.

He closes eyes, trying hard, again, to hypnotizing himself into sleep.

That's when he thinks he hears the dripping sound from the bathroom.

*What the hell? Please not the leaking problem in the first day.* Dean moans, dragging himself out of the bed, turning on the light in the bathroom.

It's as fresh clean as any new bathroom can be. No dirt on toilet lid, no stain in the bathtub. No leaking tap.

*Then where the hell is the dripping water sound coming from? Pipes inside the walls?*

Dean glances at the walls, can't see anything except just feeling some chillness seeping through his nightgowns, making his feet cold. The temperature is lower than he expects. He sees condensed moisture forming some wetness on the wall, a thin layer of frost. Guess April is still not a warm season then.

He lays back to the bed.

The sound of dripping water continues.

He manages to count them in place of counting sheep, and finally gets a few hours before the alarm goes off.

The morning is filled with yawns and he's only back online after the second cup of coffee.

Dean gets on his way to the office.

<br>

Seven to five isn't an easy schedule but Dean gets used to it, at least it pays well with all the benefit package. The room is already dark when he comes back. Dark, and empty, and quiet. Not like he's expecting a wife and a warm dinner waiting for him at home or anything.

He prepares his own dinner and finishes it in front of TV.

Dishes done, trashes taken out, he sits down with a book, and that's when he notices that prickling feeling is back, the feeling from last night that he almost already forget or would think of it as a dream. The feeling that he's not alone. The feeling of being watched, being observed, being analyzed. The feeling of a prey right before the predator jumps on them. The feeling of a sitting duck.

Dean shifts in his ergonomic office chair, trying to ignore the strange sensation, mentally telling the standing hair on the back of the neck to ease. Two pages passed with no idea what he's reading, he has to put down the book and walks around the room, scouting.

He turns on all the light in the room, every corner bright and lit-up. He walks from one corner to another, inspecting the places where he already inspected during the apartment tour. There is nothing there. And of course there is no *one* there, either.

Dean laughs at himself. "Since when did you become a paranoid?"

He turns off the lights, leaving only the one above his desk.

The lamp flickers, blinking and diming, on and off, on and off.

"Come on!" Dean glares at lamp, as if his gaze can make the light behave.

It does not.

He turns it off and back on. The light shakes worse. His eyes hurt from staring at the blinking light, it's giving him headache.

He just turns it off.

*I'll deal with it tomorrow.* Dean thinks, taking a mental note for tomorrow's to-do item.

Standing in the dark, that is when he starts hearing sounds again. Someone is crying, he thinks, like a kid or a young woman. The sound is quiet and distant, like last night's dripping water sound.

*Some neighbor might be watching some drama TV then.* Dean tells himself, forcing down the unreasonable thoughts that are slowly creeping up inside his head. Not liking how they sound like.

*I'm not crazy.* He thinks, hard. Just some electricity problem and neighbor's TV and pipes in the walls.

<br>

He can't sleep, again.

Of all the things, this is the one that annoys him the most.

He can live with a busted lamp among everything else, but this feeling of being watched, being noticed, being surrounded by the darkness not knowing what's in there, it's killing him.

Dean curses, and sits up, turning on the lamp on bedstand.

Somber orange light showers over the room, taking away the dark shadow. The feeling does not ease, and Dean can't close his eyes and can't fall asleep. He scratches his head, exhausted. It's killing him but he doesn't know what's killing him.

He leaves a wall lamp on in the living room when he lies back down again, trying very hard to ignore that corner of the mind that tells him he's being a crying baby afraid of the dark.

The night does not go by easily.

<br>

Dean snaps out of the dream in a gasp, his chest heavy with weight. His hands clenching the chest, panting. He already can't remember the dream, just the lingering feeling of the weight on the chest, the breathlessness, the sweat on his back still remind him of a rough night.

He checks the clock, it still has twenty minutes before his usual hour. He gets up anyway, washing away the sticky feeling.

The shower water is freezing cold, for quite a while. He has to wait there, shuddering, cursing. And eventually it turns up, leaving the whole bathroom steaming with the hot vapor. The mirror covered by the steam.

Dean is wiping his hair, when he has a glance at the mirror. And that freezes him dead on spot. The steam on the mirror has four capital letters, unmistakably read: "DEAD."

He flees out of his apartment as fast as he can.

<br>

*There is something in his apartment.* Dean is sure.

They tell him there is nothing wrong with his apartment, the maintenance guys, after checking the lamp, the electricity, the pipe, and the AC. They tell him everything working perfectly, temperature warm and cozy, lights bright and constant. They wish him a good night and leave.

Dean has to gather up enough courage to go back into this place that is his new home for merely two days and he is already thinking about moving out.

*Jo would never let it go and it will forever be a troll.* Dean grimaces, slumping down on the chair.

They tell him the mirror is clean, but it might be a previous prank someone draw on it, leaving slight trace of skin oil or something, that's why the words show up. They try heating up and steaming again, but no words this time. "Probably nothing." They say.

But "probably" is not the same as "exactly" or "absolutely", is it?

Dean still cannot sleep. And after the words on mirror, it's getting worse. He always has to leave a wall lamp on in the nights now. And he has to use some melatonin to help.

He stares at his own image in the mirror, seeing the bag under the eyes growing larger and deeper and darker. He asks, "What the hell is going on?" The reflection stares back at him, exhausted, no answer for him.

The water tap turns on by itself in front of him, steam covering the mirror from bottom up. The letters start writing themselves, one stroke at a time, by some floating invisible hands: D - E - A --

Dean yells in terror and runs out of the apartment.

He sleeps in a hotel that day. And the next.

<br>

"*Something* is in my apartment!" He can't stop himself from snapping at the person on the other side of the line, someone from the housing management.

"Mr. Smith, there is nothing in your apartment, we had undergone multiple rounds of thorough investigation, both before you moved in and upon request. The latest one was only two days ago." The operator answers, tone unchanging, not too different from a robot.

"I'm telling you, I can feel it! And apparently, with all those Death Notebook memo, I'm given an early warning notice, and I'm not gonna ignore it!" Dean rubs at his eyes, feeling the temples throbbing. The lack of sleep is tearing him apart atom by atom.

"You will still have to pay all the rent for the rest of the year as well as the deposit money, if you end up deciding to move out early. It is written under section twenty six of the rent release, stating the situation where early termination is unavoidable." The robot tone tells him flatly. Too smooth.

Damn it. Yeah, he knows the clause. He frowned at it before signing, but it's kind of standard protocol.

"I could have been dead! Or might will be! The threat message is pretty straightforward." He tries again.

"The terms for death of tenant is covered in section thirty three. You or your representative will only need to give two months' written notice and continue the payment until then."

Dean snaps the phone shut, cursing.

<br>

He goes back to the apartment, eventually, before the week is over. *This is ridiculous,* he thinks to himself, *what he thinks he sees can't be real.*

Keeping distance between the troublesome source, sometimes the situation would just look more optimistic by itself. Same for the calming time before quarreling couples go into divorce. Same for a mysterious mischievous room.

Dean's courage grows back.

He steps over the threshold. The door slams behind him, locked by itself.

All the lights in the room, regardless it's on or off, connected or not, start frantically flickering. Blinking and flashing, dizzy and blinding, like the worst kind of club lighting.

The coffee machine and the blender on kitchen counter turns on by themselves, motors and blades humming and running, spinning in vain.

He can hear the tabs turning on, water overflowing in the bathtub and sinks, flooding to the floor.

His desk printer starts printing automatically, eating blank papers and spitting ones with letters. At a glimpse, he can see it repeats the same message over and over: a lot of D's, E's, and A's.

Dean jumps on his heels, turning around to try the door knobs, desperate. It holds still under his grip.

He shouts "Help" and pounds on the door -- no one comes to him. He fetches his phone for an emergency call -- the phone has no signal.

The air temperature is dropping, his breath condensed into white fog. He glances back, white smoke swirls and flutters in the center of the room, forming into some shape.

His throat already starts to get hoarse from the vain yelling, his hands and feet freezing cold.

Dean Smith thinks he is two seconds away from having a heart attack -- the kind that commonly known as: "scared to death".

<br>

### Act 2-1 (Chapter 2)

> The ghost turn out to be Cas, murdered in the house with his whole family (Jimmy/Amelia/Claire killed by Nick), unfinished business, haunting the place but didn't hurt Dean, doesn't remember who he is
>
> Dean/Cas (both) start learning about ghost 101 (iron, salt) from daily life accidents and Ghostfacers instruction video (like in S4E17), a little bit human/ghost domestic life
>
> Dean help find Cas's name/identity, some memory back

Dean is actually surprised that he still manages to stand on his two feet, not collapsing, yet. He stares at the white fog that is continuously changing shapes, dispersing and gathering, like a swarm of bees dancing, like something that might have some consciousness but not entirely sure yet. Like a bad old-time TV trying to receive the signal, making the snowflake image clearer.

In his gaze, the shape slowly settles, assembling into figure of a man. Human-like, almost, if not considering the flickering transparent color. Young, about his age, Dean observes. Casual business clothing but disheveled, tie and suit tousy, the trench coat splattered in red. He looks disoriented, his face as confused as a traveler lost in the woods.

Dean's hands are still gripped tight on the doorknob, but he forgets rattling it. He just stares at the figure that is most definitely a ghost -- fits every single ghost story in common urban legend, minus the whooping and chasing after him and killing part.

The ghost settles finally -- as stable as the old-time black-and-white TV can be, receiving its best signal already.

Dean swallows, leaning his back on the door. "Who are you?"

His brain almost starts mocking at him the moment his throat works. *Try starting a small conversation with a freaking ghost? What's he thinking?*

The figure shatters slightly, as if thinking and processing his words are taking too much of his energy that he can't focus on keeping the appearance. His eyes fall on Dean, intense, frowning. He's thinking hard, Dean realizes. But he still can't remember much.

"I -- don't really know." The ghost answers, hesitant, voice low, looking even more confused than moments ago.

The lights and noises around them start quieting out. Lights stabler, blender spinning slower, water tubs closing.

Dean gives a quick glimpse over the surroundings. No permanent damage done.

"This is you?" He uses his eyes to refer the rest of the home. The ghost gets the notion.

"I... guess so." Still hesitant, still slow and low. Looking slightly embarrassed, if Dean parses the dropping eyes correctly.

"Huh, Hell of an entrance." Dean huffs.

"Sorry." The ghost looks truly apologetic. "I didn't mean to. I don't even know I can..."

Then things go back to normal. The printer spits out the last paper, the blinking LED signal dies down, then it falls to silence. So does the coffee machine and blender and everything else.

Dean is taking these in, slowly, his brain still processing "he's talking with a real ghost that is haunting his loft" part of new information.

"Hmm, you're new? In this haunting thing?" Words roll out of his tongue without permission.

"I'm not sure about that either." This is probably the hundredth time tonight he hears the ghost say the same thing.

"What *do* you remember, then? A name, address, cause of death, anything?" Dean doesn't really know how, but somehow, he feels bad for the ghost. He tries to shake away the feeling, because -- that's just weird, isn't it?

The ghost looks down on himself, as if he's also just starting to take himself in, the hands, the cloth, the place he stands. He looks at his own transparent hands, then looks back at Dean. He says, quietly, "I'm dead."

<br>

Dean almost laughs. But he knows he shouldn't. Bad manner even for socializing with a ghost.

He holds back the pull in the lips, feeling the tight muscle on the shoulders start loosening. His hands leaving the doorknob long since. He forgets to check if the door is still locked or not.

"Yeah, I can see that." A pause, then adds. "Sorry about that."

The ghost tilts his head slightly, in appreciation. "It's ok." He says, gentle, "It's not your fault."

Dean is truly amused, this time. He walks into the room by a few steps, turning on the dining room light, taking a better look at the ghost.

He looks pale, not sure if he was like this all along or being a ghost would simply have the decoloring effect. His lips thin and tight, puckering into a sad line. His hair unraveling, his eyes bright blue, not shadowed even by the ghosty dim. The splattering blood stain on his trench coat can't help grasping for attention.

Dean gestures the proof of disaster or crime scene on his clothes, remarking. "That doesn't look good. Quite a lot of blood you got there, looks like some really bad tragedy to me."

The ghost nods, seriously. "I think so too." As if they're talking about some other people's tragedy on newspaper. His eyes lingering on Dean more than anywhere else.

Dean finds it hard to ignore his eyes even if he tries to, as if the most heavy thing this ghost has, is the weight of his stare. Dean swallows, suddenly realizing. "That's you hanging around, haunting me the last few days? Dude, it's freaking creepy! I got insomnia, and... and headache and all."

The ghost looks ashamed, shifting eyes then shifting the whole shape, his figure flickering violently as if he's going to disappear just because of the shame he's bearing and radiating. "Sorry." then, "I truly didn't mean to make you comfortable." The color of the white fog that forms him start dimming, slowly showing the trend of sinking into invisible transparency.

Dean doesn't realize he steps towards him automatically, reaching out a hand as if trying to grab a person, "Hey, wait. Don't go." Then he realizes the tip of fingers only sensing some chillness around that shape. He draws back his hands like he touches the electrical line.

The ghost frowns deeper, but his shape stabilizes. He stays.

"I thought..."

Dean touches the back of his neck. Uneasy. "I mean, you'll still be here even if I can't see you, right? Might as well stay."

The ghost contemplates on it. "I guess, but I wouldn't know if I can't sense my own existence, which leads to a philosophical question: what is *being*?"

"Can't we not go into metaphysics and philosophy? Reading those always make my head hurt, and I only do them because of college credits." Dean protests. The ghost complies in silence, lips compressed together.

"I can use some company too, not like I have many people to talk to outside of work." He gives another quick glance around the loft. This is a big place. Big, and full of empty space.

"I'm happy to stay." The ghost says. "Not like I have anywhere else to go."

Dean raises an eyebrow. "You can't leave this place? At all?" He gestures towards the door.

"Invisible walls like a prison cell." The ghost answers.

Dean huffs in sympathy. "Sounds no fun. Did you try 'Beetlejuice'?"

The ghost quirks his head, blank look. "I don't understand that reference."

Dean makes a short laughing sound. "Bad joke, sorry. A fun weird movie though, watched it when I was nine. But guess Tim Burton can't be a reliable ghost 101 guide."

"Then what is?"

"Real-life experiment, and research."

Dean makes a gesture that almost looks like he wants to pat someone on the shoulder, only to remember again and retract at the last minute.

<br>

"I never know there are so many people writing about ghosts all the time. Do they really know something about something or are they just keep making things up?" Dean frowns at his laptop screen, too many webpage opened, cramming the view, images and texts all over. The ghost stays a step away from him, looking from the side.

"Maybe both?" The ghost answers, half-heartedly.

"Wouldn't they get exposed lying if someone really tested their theories?" Dean throws a glance at the ghost, seeing his solemn look, eyes locked on the screen.

The light from the laptop shines bright, almost piercing through the foggy color the ghost is in, making him more transparent and pale than before. But somehow Dean thinks he can see him more clear this way, maybe it's the distance. He can see the five o'clock stubble covering his jaw, the skin tanned and covered with pole and hair, not the smoothened blank sheet that makes him like a two-dimensional illustration the ghosting glare makes him look. There was a real person there, before the ghost, underneath the ghost, maybe there still is. Dean blinks, taking a deep breath in then breathing it out.

"Then maybe there aren't so many ghosts around for them to be tested." The ghost says, thinking. "-- which makes me a weird one."

"Or a lucky one." Dean says quickly. "You never know."

The ghost turns his look from the screen back to himself, taking in his own bloody shape, then looking at Dean. "Doesn't feel like one."

Dean grimaces. "Point taken."

<br>

The suggestions from Ghostbusters are not exactly realistic, but the ones from Ghostfacers look like doable.

Dean checks their website and resumes. Their experiences seem to have a solid track records, with dates and locations and hows and whys.

Dean clicks open one of their headline videos titling "ghost introduction". The unprofessional -- in his businessman's customary mind -- unshaped opening lines delivered by the two boys that look barely out of school make him almost want to close the page five seconds in, but curiosity makes him stay. Besides, the ghost that is right by his side looks highly concentrated on what they're going to say.

Dean does not make any remark and keeps watching.

"The first step in any supernatural fight:" they say, then a lot more loudly together with the same words blink huge and brightly on the center of the screen -- "Figure out what you're up against."

Dean pauses the video, murmuring, "I never said I want a 'fight' or an 'up-against'." He checks his ghost, realizing he's glancing at him too.

"Thanks," he answers, eyes sad and loppy, "but still, it would be nice to know what I am or who I am."

Dean finds his heart twitch at the look on his face. "Don't worry, we'll find out." He tells him, saying it like a promise.

<br>

They work with what they know, which isn't a lot, but -- "Even the smallest hint can be a major lead sometimes, Holmes." says Dean, as he grabs a fresh new blank paper, start listing everything they know:

*\- You are dead -> the only thing you can remember*

("Wait, so, is that why you were writing the word 'dead' all over my mirror and printer? Because you can't think of anything else?" "Like I said..." "Yeah I get that, limited vocabulary resource, like the baby can only say one word.")

*\- You are a ghost -> fact by now, kinda undead then*

("So you're dead, but not dead enough? Like zombies. Do we know if we want to make you deader or undeader?" "How's that going to help?" "I don't know, just doing a little divergent thinking here, might give us some idea.")

*\- Can't leave house -> died inside this loft?*

("Got the idea from 'Beetlejuice' again, sorta make sense." "I told you, Dean, I don't understand..." "It's okay, I can stream it for you later.")

*\- suit, tie, trench coat -> tax accountant? sales? businessman?*

("Anything ring a bell?" "Not particularly.")

*\- a lot of blood -> murder? natural disaster? more than one man's blood?*

("Any idea how did you die or where are the wounds?" "Not really." "Can ghosts feel pain?" "I hope not.")

"Come over here." Dean waves him over, tuning the floor lamp to the maximum lumination, scrutinizing the blood stains more closely, studying their distribution and shape and quantity.

His brain does the automatic analysis -- cutting which vein could cause splatter like this, a broken artery can pump the spluttering blood as high as ceiling, a vena usually drip downwards instead of upwards unless they are close to heart atrium. The amount of blood and shape and direction of the splatter means...

The mind process startles Dean even himself. *How on earth does he know of all those things?*

"Looks like more than one victim to me," he finds his lips moving, giving the verdict of a conclusion. "And the weapon might be something sharp, blade maybe? Stabbed right into the heart."

He hesitates there. The ghost meets his gaze. "What?"

"The thing is, it's not your blood. You were there when those other people were killed, then the question, how did you die?" He narrows his eyes.

"Other people?" The ghost echoes, sounding even more hurt and sad than realizing that himself is dead, voice broken. Then he realizes the meaning in Dean's eyes. His eyes widens, "You don't think I'm the one that killed them, then suicide or something, do you?"

"I don't know what to think." Dean says, looking away, looking down at his own hand, looking at the screen that is still too bright and hurts his eyes, looking everywhere but where the ghost is. Then, his gut speaks, "No, I don't think it's you. I don't think it's in you."

The ghost looks relieved at hearing that.

Dean stares at the list, drafting lines and circles mindlessly on the written words, then suddenly realizes, drawing two circles and a line connecting them between "inside the loft" and "multiple murder", another arrow leading to: "cheap rent".

Dean breathes out long, relaxed like he just finished the Saturday's crosswords in The New York Times.

"What does that have to with anything?" The ghost shifts closer, pointing at the new words he just wrote down. The temperature near him drops a few degrees.

"Everything." He grins.
