## Main

### Act 1 (Chapter 1)

> Dean recently moves into the town, get the new job, move into the new apartment, only to find it haunted -> Dean a bit on edge and freaked out (horror/suspension elements)

"The place is good enough, close to the office, good view, but no compete with California of course," Dean talks on the phone, pacing in front of the large floor-to-ceiling window that has the view of a running river right down below. The penthouse view. "But at least the rent is decent -- not crazy, in this economy -- says a lot already."

"Not like you need to worry about the rent." Jo laughs on the other side of the line. "Why don't you just buy it?"

"Hey, money is money. Think of it as probationary period." Dean paces back to the kitchen, grabbing the bottle of Master Cleanse and drinking a gulp. The taste still makes him frown, but at lease it's good for health.

"Like all businessmen say."

"Yeah why am I not surprised, the whole industry says that -- hell, the whole world says that, that's how we make money, am I right?" He grins into the phone.

"I wouldn't know." Jo's voice unimpressed. "Not like I'm going to be business major or anything."

"How's school? Everything okay there?" Dean's voice gets more straight now, dropping the teasing tone.

"Why, if I get bullied, you'll dash in here kicking their asses?"

"I might worry more about the other guy, you know, call an ambulance before you kill them or do something worse."

"Am I that bad?"

"You've been hitting dudes in the nose since like twelve, Jo. I would know."

"That's because they're all jerks."

"No argument there, but still, I got to look out for my little sister."

Jo snorts a laugh. "Bye Dean. Oh and, mom and dad said congrats on your new job."

Dean raises his eyebrows. "There's no shame to congratulate me yourself, you know."

"Oh I know." Jo chuckles, hanging up the phone.

*What a pain in the ass.* Dean amuses, putting the phone back into the pocket, walking back to the center of the living room.

The place was furnitured when he moved in, the sofa, the TV stand, the bed, all included and in good shape. And not the cheap stuff, he can tell.

He's actually impressed with everything and the view, the rent should at least go double or triple. He has asked the renting company about the reason why, but all he gets is a big vague "You find a good deal" as if they suddenly take an interest in the charity.

There is no such thing as free lunch in the business, and no one would let go of free money, so he did have suspicion. But after inspecting the place for three rounds, there is still no problem he can find, the building structure is compliant, the renting contract is legit, he even has his lawyer going through the lines and there is nothing suspicious. "Guess it really is a good deal then." His lawyer told him.

So he moved in. Not with many possessions, just a number of boxes with some clothes and books that can fit into his Prius. He's here, new job, new place, new life ahead. Fresh start.

Dean Smith feels good about the life.

<br>

*Probably just because it's the first night, in a new room, on a new bed.* Dean tells himself, trying the yoga breathing.

He's still turning and rolling over in the middle of the night, feeling uneasy.

He opens up eyes, staring at the ceiling. The alarm clock on the bedstand shows around two now. He only has another four hours before having to get up for the first day in office. He wouldn't want to be late for the first day.

The sleepiness is there, hiding behind the eyelids, he can feel it, his head and eyes heavy from the usual biological clock, but something is disturbing his gut. The feeling of being watched by something unseen in the dark.

Dean forces his eyes widen, trying to scan the room. There is nothing there, of course. The quiet night. So quiet he thinks he can even imagine neighbor's light snoring.

He closes eyes, trying hard, again, to hypnotizing himself into sleep.

That's when he thinks he hears the dripping sound from the bathroom.

*What the hell? Please not the leaking problem in the first day.* Dean moans, dragging himself out of the bed, turning on the light in the bathroom.

It's as fresh clean as any new bathroom can be. No dirt on toilet lid, no stain in the bathtub. No leaking tap.

*Then where the hell is the dripping water sound coming from? Pipes inside the walls?*

Dean glances at the walls, can't see anything except just feeling some chillness seeping through his nightgowns, making his feet cold. The temperature is lower than he expects. He sees condensed moisture forming some wetness on the wall, a thin layer of frost. Guess April is still not a warm season then.

He lays back to the bed.

The sound of dripping water continues.

He manages to count them in place of counting sheep, and finally gets a few hours before the alarm goes off.

The morning is filled with yawns and he's only back online after the second cup of coffee.

Dean gets on his way to the office.

<br>

Seven to five isn't an easy schedule but Dean gets used to it, at least it pays well with all the benefit package. The room is already dark when he comes back. Dark, and empty, and quiet. Not like he's expecting a wife and a warm dinner waiting for him at home or anything.

He prepares his own dinner and finishes it in front of TV.

Dishes done, trashes taken out, he sits down with a book, and that's when he notices that prickling feeling is back, the feeling from last night that he almost already forget or would think of it as a dream. The feeling that he's not alone. The feeling of being watched, being observed, being analyzed. The feeling of a prey right before the predator jumps on them. The feeling of a sitting duck.

Dean shifts in his ergonomic office chair, trying to ignore the strange sensation, mentally telling the standing hair on the back of the neck to ease. Two pages passed with no idea what he's reading, he has to put down the book and walks around the room, scouting.

He turns on all the light in the room, every corner bright and lit-up. He walks from one corner to another, inspecting the places where he already inspected during the apartment tour. There is nothing there. And of course there is no *one* there, either.

Dean laughs at himself. "Since when did you become a paranoid?"

He turns off the lights, leaving only the one above his desk.

The lamp flickers, blinking and diming, on and off, on and off.

"Come on!" Dean glares at lamp, as if his gaze can make the light behave.

It does not.

He turns it off and back on. The light shakes worse. His eyes hurt from staring at the blinking light, it's giving him headache.

He just turns it off.

*I'll deal with it tomorrow.* Dean thinks, taking a mental note for tomorrow's to-do item.

Standing in the dark, that is when he starts hearing sounds again. Someone is crying, he thinks, like a kid or a young woman. The sound is quiet and distant, like last night's dripping water sound.

*Some neighbor might be watching some drama TV then.* Dean tells himself, forcing down the unreasonable thoughts that are slowly creeping up inside his head. Not liking how they sound like.

*I'm not crazy.* He thinks, hard. Just some electricity problem and neighbor's TV and pipes in the walls.

<br>

He can't sleep, again.

Of all the things, this is the one that annoys him the most.

He can live with a busted lamp among everything else, but this feeling of being watched, being noticed, being surrounded by the darkness not knowing what's in there, it's killing him.

Dean curses, and sits up, turning on the lamp on bedstand.

Somber orange light showers over the room, taking away the dark shadow. The feeling does not ease, and Dean can't close his eyes and can't fall asleep. He scratches his head, exhausted. It's killing him but he doesn't know what's killing him.

He leaves a wall lamp on in the living room when he lies back down again, trying very hard to ignore that corner of the mind that tells him he's being a crying baby afraid of the dark.

The night does not go by easily.

<br>

Dean snaps out of the dream in a gasp, his chest heavy with weight. His hands clenching the chest, panting. He already can't remember the dream, just the lingering feeling of the weight on the chest, the breathlessness, the sweat on his back still remind him of a rough night.

He checks the clock, it still has twenty minutes before his usual hour. He gets up anyway, washing away the sticky feeling.

The shower water is freezing cold, for quite a while. He has to wait there, shuddering, cursing. And eventually it turns up, leaving the whole bathroom steaming with the hot vapor. The mirror covered by the steam.

Dean is wiping his hair, when he has a glance at the mirror. And that freezes him dead on spot. The steam on the mirror has four capital letters, unmistakably read: "DEAD."

He flees out of his apartment as fast as he can.

<br>

*There is something in his apartment.* Dean is sure.

They tell him there is nothing wrong with his apartment, the maintenance guys, after checking the lamp, the electricity, the pipe, and the AC. They tell him everything working perfectly, temperature warm and cozy, lights bright and constant. They wish him a good night and leave.

Dean has to gather up enough courage to go back into this place that is his new home for merely two days and he is already thinking about moving out.

*Jo would never stop taunting him with that.* Dean grimaces, slumping down on the chair.

They tell him the mirror is clean, but it might be a previous prank someone draw on it, leaving slight trace of skin oil or something, that's why the words show up. They try heating up and steaming again, but no words this time. "Probably nothing." They say.

But "probably" is not the same as "exactly" or "absolutely", is it?

Dean still cannot sleep. And after the words on mirror, it's getting worse. He always has to leave a wall lamp on in the nights now. And he has to use some melatonin to help.

He stares at his own image in the mirror, seeing the bag under the eyes growing larger and deeper and darker. He asks, "What the hell is going on?" The reflection stares back at him, exhausted, no answer for him.

The water tap turns on by itself in front of him, steam covering the mirror from bottom up. The letters start writing themselves, one stroke at a time, by some floating invisible hands: D - E - A --

Dean yells in terror and runs out of the apartment.

He sleeps in a hotel that day. And the next.

<br>

"*Something* is in my apartment!" He can't stop himself from snapping at the person on the other side of the line, someone from the housing management.

"Mr. Smith, there is nothing in your apartment, we had undergone multiple rounds of thorough investigation, both before you moved in and upon request. The latest one was only two days ago." The operator answers, tone unchanging, not too different from a robot.

"I'm telling you, I can feel it! And apparently, with all those Death Notebook memo, I'm given an early warning notice, and I'm not gonna ignore it!" Dean rubs at his eyes, feeling the temples throbbing. The lack of sleep is tearing him apart atom by atom.

"You will still have to pay all the rent for the rest of the year as well as the deposit money, if you end up deciding to move out early. It is written under section twenty six of the rent release, stating the situation where early termination is unavoidable." The robot tone tells him flatly. Too smooth.

Damn it. Yeah, he knows the clause. He frowned at it before signing, but it's kind of standard protocol.

"I could have been dead! Or might will be! The threat message is pretty straightforward." He tries again.

"The terms for death of tenant is covered in section thirty three. You or your representative will only need to give two months' written notice and continue the payment until then."

Dean snaps the phone shut, cursing.

<br>

He goes back to the apartment, eventually, before the week is over. *This is ridiculous,* he thinks to himself, *what he thinks he sees can't be real.*

Keeping distance between the troublesome source, sometimes the situation would just look more optimistic by itself. Same for the calming time before quarreling couples go into divorce. Same for a mysterious mischievous room.

Dean's courage grows back.

He steps over the threshold. The door slams behind him, locked by itself.

All the lights in the room, regardless it's on or off, connected or not, start frantically flickering. Blinking and flashing, dizzy and blinding, like the worst kind of club lighting.

The coffee machine and the blender on kitchen counter turns on by themselves, motors and blades humming and running, spinning in vain.

He can hear the tabs turning on, water overflowing in the bathtub and sinks, flooding to the floor.

His desk printer starts printing automatically, eating blank papers and spitting ones with letters. At a glimpse, he can see it repeats the same message over and over: a lot of D's, E's, and A's.

Dean jumps on his heels, turning around to try the door knobs, desperate. It holds still under his grip.

He shouts "Help" and pounds on the door -- no one comes to him. He fetches his phone for an emergency call -- the phone has no signal.

The air temperature is dropping, his breath condensed into white fog. He glances back, white smoke swirls and flutters in the center of the room, forming into some shape.

His throat already starts to get hoarse from the vain yelling, his hands and feet freezing cold.

Dean Smith thinks he is two seconds away from having a heart attack -- the kind that commonly known as: "scared to death".

<br>

### Act 2-1 (Chapter 2)

> The ghost turn out to be Cas, murdered in the house with his whole family (Jimmy/Amelia/Claire killed by Nick), unfinished business, haunting the place but didn't hurt Dean, doesn't remember who he is
>
> Dean/Cas (both) start learning about ghost 101 (iron, salt) from daily life accidents and Ghostfacers instruction video (like in S4E17), a little bit human/ghost domestic life
>
> Dean help find Cas's name/identity, some memory back

Dean is actually surprised that he still manages to stand on his two feet, not collapsing, yet. He stares at the white fog that is continuously changing shapes, dispersing and gathering, like a swarm of bees dancing, like something that might have some consciousness but not entirely sure yet. Like a bad old-time TV trying to receive the signal, making the snowflake image clearer.

In his gaze, the shape slowly settles, assembling into figure of a man. Human-like, almost, if not considering the flickering transparent color. Young, about his age, Dean observes. Casual business clothing but disheveled, tie and suit tousy, the trench coat splattered in red. He looks disoriented, his face as confused as a traveler lost in the woods.

Dean's hands are still gripped tight on the doorknob, but he forgets rattling it. He just stares at the figure that is most definitely a ghost -- fits every single ghost story in common urban legend, minus the whooping and chasing after him and killing part.

The ghost settles finally -- as stable as the old-time black-and-white TV can be, receiving its best signal already.

Dean swallows, leaning his back on the door. "Who are you?"

His brain almost starts mocking at him the moment his throat works. *Try starting a small conversation with a freaking ghost? What's he thinking?*

The figure shatters slightly, as if thinking and processing his words are taking too much of his energy that he can't focus on keeping the appearance. His eyes fall on Dean, intense, frowning. He's thinking hard, Dean realizes. But he still can't remember much.

"I -- don't really know." The ghost answers, hesitant, voice low, looking even more confused than moments ago.

The lights and noises around them start quieting out. Lights stabler, blender spinning slower, water tubs closing.

Dean gives a quick glimpse over the surroundings. No permanent damage done.

"This is you?" He uses his eyes to refer the rest of the home. The ghost gets the notion.

"I... guess so." Still hesitant, still slow and low. Looking slightly embarrassed, if Dean parses the dropping eyes correctly.

"Huh, Hell of an entrance." Dean huffs.

"Sorry." The ghost looks truly apologetic. "I didn't mean to. I don't even know I can..."

Then things go back to normal. The printer spits out the last paper, the blinking LED signal dies down, then it falls to silence. So does the coffee machine and blender and everything else.

Dean is taking these in, slowly, his brain still processing "he's talking with a real ghost that is haunting his loft" part of new information.

"Hmm, you're new? In this haunting thing?" Words roll out of his tongue without permission.

"I'm not sure about that either." This is probably the hundredth time tonight he hears the ghost say the same thing and there will be hundred times more.

"What *do* you remember, then? A name, address, cause of death, anything?" Dean doesn't really know how, but somehow, he feels bad for the ghost. He tries to shake away the feeling, because -- that's just weird, isn't it?

The ghost looks down on himself, as if he's also just starting to take himself in, the hands, the cloth, the place he stands. He looks at his own transparent palms, then looks back at Dean. He says, quietly, a little sadly, "I'm dead."

<br>

Dean almost laughs. But he knows he shouldn't. Bad manner even for socializing with a ghost.

He holds back the pull in the lips, feeling the tight muscle on the shoulders start loosening. His hands leaving the doorknob long since. He forgets to check if the door is still locked or not.

"Yeah, I can see that." A pause, then adds. "Sorry about that."

The ghost tilts his head slightly, in appreciation. "It's ok." He says, gentle, "It's not your fault."

Dean is truly amused, this time. He walks into the room by a few steps, turning on the dining room light, taking a better look at the ghost.

He looks pale, not sure if he was like this all along or being a ghost would simply have the decoloring effect. His lips thin and tight, puckering into a sad line. His hair unraveling, his eyes bright blue, not shadowed even by the ghosty dim. The splattering blood stain on his trench coat can't help grasping for attention.

Dean gestures the proof of disaster or crime scene on his clothes, remarking. "That doesn't look good. Quite a lot of blood you got there, looks like some really bad tragedy to me."

The ghost nods, seriously. "I think so too." As if they're talking about some other people's tragedy on newspaper. His eyes lingering on Dean more than anywhere else.

Dean finds it hard to ignore his eyes even if he tries to, as if the most heavy thing this ghost has, is the weight of his stare. Dean swallows, suddenly realizing. "That's you hanging around, haunting me the last few days? Dude, it's freaking creepy! I got insomnia, and... and headache and all."

The ghost looks ashamed, shifting eyes then shifting the whole shape, his figure flickering violently as if he's going to disappear just because of the shame he's bearing and radiating. "Sorry." then, "I truly didn't mean to make you comfortable." The color of the white fog that forms him start dimming, slowly showing the trend of sinking into invisible transparency.

Dean doesn't realize it before he steps towards him automatically, reaching out a hand as if trying to grab a person, "Hey, wait. Don't go." Then he realizes the tip of fingers only sensing some chillness around that shape. He draws back his hands like he touches the electrical line.

The ghost frowns deeper, but his shape stabilizes. He stays.

"I thought..."

Dean touches the back of his neck. Uneasy. "I mean, you'll still be here even if I can't see you, right? Might as well stay."

The ghost contemplates on it. "I guess, but I wouldn't know if I can't sense my own existence, which leads to a philosophical question: what is *being*?"

"Can't we not go into metaphysics and philosophy? Reading those always make my head hurt, and I only do them because of college credits." Dean protests. The ghost complies in silence, lips compressed together.

"I can use some company too, not like I have many people to talk to outside of work." He gives another quick glance around the loft. This is a big place. Big, and full of empty space.

"I'm happy to stay." The ghost says. "Not like I have anywhere else to go."

Dean raises an eyebrow. "You can't leave this place? At all?" He gestures towards the door.

"Invisible walls like a prison cell." The ghost answers.

Dean huffs in sympathy. "Sounds no fun. Did you try 'Beetlejuice'?"

The ghost quirks his head, blank look. "I don't understand that reference."

Dean makes a short laughing sound. "Bad joke, sorry. A weird old movie though, watched it when I was maybe ten. But guess Tim Burton can't be a reliable ghost 101 guide."

"Then what is?"

"Real-life experiment, and research."

Dean makes a gesture that almost looks like he wants to pat someone on the shoulder, only to remember again and retract at the last minute.

<br>

"I never know there are so many people writing about ghosts all the time. Do they really know something about something or are they just keep making things up?" Dean frowns at his laptop screen, too many webpage opened, cramming the view, images and texts all over. The ghost stays a step away from him, looking from the side.

"Maybe both?" The ghost answers, half-heartedly.

"Wouldn't they get exposed lying if someone really tested their theories?" Dean throws a glance at the ghost, seeing his solemn look, eyes locked on the screen.

The light from the laptop shines bright, almost piercing through the foggy color the ghost is in, making him more transparent and pale than before. But somehow Dean thinks he can see him more clear this way, maybe it's the distance. He can see the five o'clock stubble covering his jaw, lips dry and chapped, the skin tanned and covered with poles and hairs, not the smoothened blank sheet that is no different from a two-dimensional illustration the ghosting glare makes him look. There was a real person there, before the ghost, underneath the ghost, maybe there still is. Dean blinks, taking a deep breath in then breathing it out.

"Maybe there aren't so many ghosts around for them to be tested." The ghost says, thinking. "-- which makes me a weird one."

"Or a lucky one." Dean says quickly. "You never know."

The ghost turns his look from the screen back to himself, taking in his own bloody shape, then looking at Dean. "Doesn't feel like one."

Dean grimaces. "Point taken."

<br>

The suggestions from Ghostbusters are not exactly realistic, but the ones from Ghostfacers look like doable.

Dean checks their website and resumes. Their experiences seem to have a solid track records, with dates and locations and hows and whys.

Dean clicks open one of their headline videos titling "ghost introduction". The unprofessional -- in his businessman's customary mind -- unshaped opening lines delivered by the two boys that look barely out of school make him almost want to close the page five seconds in, but curiosity makes him stay. Besides, the ghost that is right by his side looks highly concentrated on what they're going to say.

Dean does not make any remark and keeps watching.

"The first step in any supernatural fight:" they say, then a lot more loudly together with the same words blink huge and brightly on the center of the screen -- "Figure out what you're up against."

Dean pauses the video, murmuring, "I never said I want a 'fight' or an 'up-against'." He checks his ghost, realizing he's glancing at him too.

"Thanks," he answers, eyes sad and loppy, "but still, it would be nice to know what I am or who I am."

Dean finds his heart twitch at the look on his face. "Don't worry, we'll find out." He tells him, saying it like a promise.

<br>

They work with what they know, which isn't a lot, but -- "Even the smallest hint can be a major lead sometimes, Holmes." says Dean, as he grabs a fresh new blank paper, start listing everything they know:

*\- You are dead -> the only thing you can remember*

("Wait, so, is that why you were writing the word 'dead' all over my mirror and printer? Because you can't think of anything else?" "Like I said..." "Yeah I get that, limited vocabulary resource, like the little babies can only say one word.")

*\- You are a ghost, can walk and talk -> facts*

("So you're dead, but not dead enough? Like zombies. Do we know if we want to make you deader or undeader?" "How's that going to help?" "I don't know, just doing a little divergent thinking here, might give us some idea.")

*\- Can't leave house -> died inside this loft?*

("Got the idea from 'Beetlejuice' again, sorta make sense." "I told you, Dean, I don't understand..." "It's okay, I can stream it for you later.")

*\- suit, tie, trench coat -> tax accountant? sales? businessman?*

("Anything ring a bell?" "Not particularly.")

*\- a lot of blood -> murder? natural disaster? more than one man's blood?*

("Any idea how did you die or where are the wounds?" "Not really." "Can ghosts feel pain?" "I hope not.")

"Come over here." Dean waves him over, tuning the floor lamp to the maximum lumination, scrutinizing the blood stains more closely, studying their distribution and shape and quantity.

His brain does the automatic analysis: cutting which vein could cause splatter like this -- a broken artery can pump the spluttering blood as high as ceiling, a vena usually drip downwards instead of upwards unless they are close to heart atrium. The amount of blood and shape and direction of the splatter means...

The mind process startles Dean even himself. *How on earth does he know of all those things?*

"Looks like more than one victim to me," he finds his lips moving, giving the verdict of a conclusion. "And the weapon might be something sharp, blade maybe? Stabbed right into the heart."

He hesitates there. The ghost meets his gaze. "What?"

"The thing is, it's not your blood. Because otherwise it would be sputter outwards, not onto the clothes like this. Which means you were there when those other people were killed, then the question is, how did *you* die?" He narrows his eyes.

"Other people?" The ghost echoes, sounding even more hurt and sad than realizing that himself is dead, voice broken. Then he realizes the meaning in Dean's eyes. His eyes widens, "You don't think I'm the one that killed them, then suicide or something, do you?"

"I don't know what to think." Dean says, looking away, looking down at his own hand, looking at the screen that is still too bright and hurts his eyes, looking everywhere but where the ghost is. Then, his gut speaks, "No, I don't think it's you. I don't think it's in you."

The ghost looks relieved at hearing that.

Dean stares at the list, drafting lines and circles mindlessly on the written words, then suddenly realizes, drawing two circles and a line connecting them between "inside the loft" and "multiple murder", another arrow leading to: "cheap rent".

Dean breathes out long, relaxed like he just finished the Saturday's crosswords in The New York Times.

"What does that have to with anything?" The ghost shifts closer, pointing at the new words he just wrote down. The temperature near him drops a few degrees.

"Everything." He grins.

<br>

### Act 2-2

> The ghost turn out to be Cas, murdered in the house with his whole family (Jimmy/Amelia/Claire killed by Nick), unfinished business, haunting the place but didn't hurt Dean
>
> Dean/Cas (both) start learning about ghost 101 (iron, salt) from introductory video
>
> Dean learn about Cas's death cause tragedy, try to help revenge/find peace
>
> (start scene tightly continuous to previous Act (both will be same chapter during publish), Dean start researching the cover-up murders in the apartment, no news, but hacked into police coroner report, get the names)

"I would have called my lawyer if it's not this late." Dean checks the time, it is indeed way later than his usual beauty sleep time, but somehow he isn't sleepy at all. In fact, he can practically feel the adrenaline pumping through his veins right this moment. He decides sleeping can wait.

"Or find a private detective or something." Dean thinks aloud, at the same time opening the webpage and starts typing.

"But you seem like knowing what you're doing." The ghost watches his move.

Dean's eyes on the screen, fingers moving automatically. "To be honest I don't know anything, but it's like some kind of muscle memory, my fingers know what to do, so I'm just letting the gut control here for a minute."

His fingers click open the dark net, searching through the pages he never he has access to. The dirty dark side of the world he tends to choose to pretend they're not there and they have nothing to do with his life.

The real state report shows nothing, the history of the place is smooth and clean like a contract with no fine print. In fact, if he really thinks about that, it's just way too clean. How can a building never have even a single small accident? Not any elevator malfunction, not one person slipping in front of their door and breaking their legs?

He knew something might be off there when he rented the place, but never able to find any dirt. But now, it seems, he's digging into something.

The real state report might be covered, but the police reports and hospital reports are honest and accurate -- at least he hopes so. He searches back dates and months, then years. He doesn't really have to traceback too much before he stops at a coroner's report and photo of the body.

He reads the description, then checks the photo, then reads the report again. Dean swallows, tongues dry, throat tight. He steals a glance at the ghost, the silence between them stretches, but he knows they are both reading the same thing. The same bloody truth in their faces.

"I'm sorry." Dean finally manages, voice low and sorry. He wants to close the page.

The ghost is still reading the same page. With his name, his address, his date of birth and cause of death on it. He reads it, then re-reads it, then re-re-reads it. Dean doesn't know if he's just staring at it by this time or actually still reading it over and over again.

"Castiel." The ghost moves his lips, voice too quietly, barely audible. "My name is Castiel."

Dean nods, quietly.

The coroner's reports have a date of two months ago, with four bodies sending to the coroner's office at the same day, around same time of death, and same cause of death -- Castiel Novak, along with Jimmy Novak, Amelia Novak, and Claire Novak, all stabbed to death by multiple attacks of blade, in their home, in their sleep.

The police report says they have no other relatives to contact with, there are no parents or even any remote cousins or uncles. It is assumed that the Novak family is having a little reunion, Castiel Novak visiting his twin brother's family and staying at their home for the night. That is when the tragedy happens.

A "tragedy" -- that is the term they used in the report, not a crime, not a massive murder, as if it's just something natural but bad happened to land on their head. Dean thinks when he reads.

They say it's a crazy sociopath, a random killer, just randomly picked the house and force entered and committed the crime. Somehow there was some power outage around the area by that time, and none of the surveillance cameras were working. They never find the man, and with the too few leads and no family member to report to, the police just hang the case like a piece of pork on the hanger.

There is no closure. There is no justice. There is no consequence.

Just a pile of blood. Then a pile of ashes.

Their bodies were burned and stored with the city, probably no one would ever ask for.

This is just the worst ending anyone could ever have. Dean thinks, trying to imagine if it is the ending of himself, then can't help feeling the breath is too caught up in his throat he's going to choke.

He turns to the ghost -- it's Castiel now, now that he knows the name. But he doesn't know what to say. He doesn't know if there is even any language that's ever invented for something so tragedy, so sad, so hard to read, let alone accept. And there is even no one to feel sad for them. There probably isn't even a funeral at all.

"Hey," Dean murmurs, checking Castiel's looks. "Are you okay?"

Castiel's ghosty shape flickers, like the last time he tries to process the language or understand the situation or his own existence or the motion. Dean can't help notice the pattern.

"Hey, hey, Castiel. Just, don't wear yourself out. Just, breathe." Dean hurries, then kicking himself in the mind for the stupidity of the suggestion. But it seems Castiel understands his effort.

The shape swings and shakes, the desk lamp blinks, dimming and brightening, Castiel's chest rises and falls, as if air is actually still flowing through his pipe. His shape is still more vague than before, but at least it stabilizes.

"No," Castiel answers, finally, his sound teary, as if he wants to cry but there is no tear can be generated. "No, I'm not okay." He tells Dean, eyes unbelievably big and sad. "I'll never be okay."

"I'm really sorry." Dean feels terrible, and even worse, he doesn't know what to do. Should he comfort the ghost? Should he do something to help the ghost... live better? Or die better? Anything at all?

"They're all dead. Even Claire. She's only ten! Who could have done that?!" Castiel looks at Dean, his eyes piercing into his skull.

Dean swallows hard. "I, I don't know, and it looks like not even the police can do anything to help figure that out."

"So the world just doesn't care that we're dead? Nothing changes? No consequence at all? No one even *knows*?" Castiel's questions fall heavily in the air, making Dean's breathing difficult, making his chest tight like lead.

"No," He finds himself answering. "I know now, and I care. It's not right. Someone should fix it."

"But how? If the police can't find the killer, do you think you can?"

"No, I mean, help you. That must be the reason you stay as a ghost, right?" Dean gestures Castiel's feature. "Even if I can't help find the killer, maybe at least help you move on or something. We only just went through the first step in that video, and we know now who are you. Let's just see what else to learn."

<br>

The second step in a ghost-related situation, according to the legendary Ghostfacers members Ed and Harry, is to kill them.

Dean shifts in the seat uncomfortably. Even the mention of the word "kill" makes his stomach curls. He doesn't want to think about how Castiel would think about it. Who would ever think of *killing* a person twice, for Christ's sake?

But at least he learns something new about the ghosts now -- Salt is like burning acid to the them. Irons dissipates them instantly. And shotguns with fresh rock salt bullets apparently can disperse them extremely effectively. To make the ghosts disappear permanently, burn their remains. In the very rare situations when that's not possible, find their unfinished business that makes them ghosts, try solve them and help them get over and find peace.

They finish the video quietly. Let the screen pause on its own once it finishes. They exchange looks.

Dean finds himself in the stubborn stare contest with Castiel again, can't move his eyes away.

"Ugh," he manages to start, but fails to think of a single thing to say next.

"Are you going to burn my remains and make me disappear permanently?" Castiel asks quietly, not showing any sign of anger, just sad.

"No!" Dean blurts out without thinking. And it's true. With all the new information he just learned about "how to handle a supernatural ghost situation", he was not remotely thinking about getting rid of the ghost that's hanging around his place, no more than three feet away from him. He finds himself not afraid of him at all, especially with his bright blue eyes locked in him. Castiel looks more human than any ghost he would imagine, except for the rare times when he's apparently having some storm of thoughts and emotions flowing through and his shape flickers, or when Dean forgets he's not human and tries to touch him, that's when he's reminded.

"I think we have a bigger problem than you being a ghost." Dean explains. "I think the world would be a better place if the killer is gone, instead of you. Besides, didn't the report say you and your family are already cremated? So there wouldn't be any remains to burn anyway, you'll just have to hang around here and stuck with me for a bit longer while we figure those out."

Castiel widens his eyes. "You'll do that for me?"

Dean shrugs. "Not like I have anything else to do outside of work."

### Act 2-3 (Chapter 3)

> Dean/Cas (both) start learning about ghost 101 (iron, salt) from daily life accidents, a little bit human/ghost domestic life, start getting close
>
> Dean try to help Cas revenge/find peace

The work still comes first though. But at least now that he knows what -- who -- is out there in the dark, hanging around and glancing at him once in a while, Dean's sleeping problem is greatly improved.

"Would you mind not stay in my room when I'm changing or trying to sleep?" Dean says, with his eyes closed, facing the ceiling. He swears he can hear the sound of something extremely like clothes rubbing. But it might just because of the air flow making the clothes in the closet flutter.

"Sorry." Castiel answers, voice floating farther away, moving towards the kitchen. "I'll just, stay here then."

Dean hums. Focusing on trying to falling asleep again. But somehow his mind flows to the kitchen where he guess Castiel would be. Would he be standing there the whole night, or sitting in a chair? Can ghosts sit? What if he accidentally touch the salt sprinkler and hurt himself?

"Cas?" Dean says again, slightly raising his voice.

"Yes?" The ghost answers immediately, voice closing in on him again, but not close enough so he would know he's still on the other side of the bedroom wall.

"Be careful about the salt on the counter. Or the poker by the fireplace." Dean tries to think what else is made of iron. "I'll put them somewhere else tomorrow. Just, be careful."

"Okay." Castiel's answering voice is short, but somehow Dean thinks he can imagine the small curve on tip of his lips when he knows he's delighted by something he says.

Dean's own lips feel a pull at the tip. He falls into sleep shortly.

<br>

The alarm clock rings at seven.

Dean fumbles the key and turns it off before opening his eyes. He feels good, it seems to be a long time since last time he has a solid full night of sleep. And he almost forgets why.

He walks towards the kitchen, yawning lazily, his brain still in the process of loading. He walks into straight into Castiel and emerges from the other side. The soaking coldness wakes him up immediately like a buck of icy water pouring down from his head.

"What the hell?" He jumps, then he remembers.

Castiel still stands where he was two seconds ago, presumably exactly where he stays the whole night, looking curious and confused, but not unpleasant. "Sorry?" He says, carefully, a little unsure.

"Sorry, my bad." Dean echoes. "Should look at my way. Forget I'm sharing now."

"I guess it's good that I won't be bumped to the ground or anything." Castiel says, moving a few steps away, leaving the kitchen unoccupied.

"Yeah." Dean answers, reaching for the coffee to make his pot of latte for the day, when he realizes the cabinet door is opened, the coffee bag is tilted, as if someone was trying to take it from there but aren't quite successful.

He turns to the ghost. "You did that?"

Castiel averts his look. "Yes."

"Why?"

"Thought I'd try to make some coffee before you get up, but looks like I don't really have enough strength for that." Castiel looks at the floor in front of him. "It took me whole night to open that cabinet, almost exhaust me out. Sorry I can't really help with anything."

Dean raises an eyebrow. "You want to help make some coffee."

That's a statement, not a question.

Castiel is unsure if he should answer that, he looks up, hesitant. "Yes. You agree to help find the person who killed me, thought at least I can do is making you some damn coffee."

Dean smiles, turning to make himself the coffee, pouring the beans into grinder and the powders into the coffee machine. He says, when the room starts flowing with the sweet bitter smell of the freshly brew coffee. "Thanks for the effort. But don't stress out, I won't ask you to share the rent or anything."

Castiel simply nods.

<br>

Dean drives to the work. Then he has meetings with clients. Then he has meetings with his direct reports. Then he drafts a new quarter plan to be reviewed by his superior. Then he has lunch at the desk. And then more email correspondence. Followed by an unexpected phone call from a fellow colleague from the Finance Department about some new change in the forms.

He spins around the office like a spinning top, the phone and keyboard keep him busy like a bee. But this is just the job.

He puts the smiling face when he's in the meetings. He throws some light jokes on the table during the phone call with the clients. He types a hundred words per minute and doesn't feel a thing. He checks the clock on the wall, it's still not time to go home.

A man knocks on the door. "You get a minute?"

Dean takes off the earphone in a hurry, standing up from behind his desk, pulling a big grin. "Yes, of course, Mr. Adler."

His superior, the senior VP of the company, steps into his office. The man has so many years of experience in the industry that people can just tell from the way his forehead shines or his body holding up the starched-up suit.

"How are you setting in, Dean?" The man asks, eyes cutting into Dean like he can see through everything inside his brain. Dean feels there is nowhere to hide beneath those eyes. "New city, new job, hope there is no hassle?"

"No, sir, not at all." He answers cheerfully, automatically. "All going very well."

"Thought I see you not having enough rest last few days. New bed?" Mr. Adler observes.

Dean gives a little chuckle. "Yeah, new bed. A lot better now. Last night I slept like a baby."

"Good to hear. Let me know if you need anything." Mr. Adler pats on his shoulder. "Good work, Dean. Really important work here."

Dean echoes. "Yes I know, Mr. Adler. Really important work." He watches the man leaving his office.

It's still not the time to leave the work yet.

He answers more phone calls. He replies more emails. He writes more documents. He checks time again. And he doesn't really know where this restlessness come from. And he doesn't really want to think about it.

Five o'clock. Then six. By six thirty, he leaves the building.

Pressing the elevator button hard, marching to his Prius, driving home in the end-of-day traffic jam, he rushes to fish his keys out, pushing the door open.

Dean doesn't realize he's holding his breath when he turns on the light. Not like he's expecting a wife or a cooked dinner on the table.

But he does find Castiel standing by the window, staring outside. The river flows underneath, stretching from one side to the other, reflecting the night light from the buildings and traffic by its shores. The darkness and starry night light makes his figure looks more solid, as if just a human standing by the window, enjoying the penthouse view.

"You're still here." Dean says.

"Where would I go?" Castiel looks back at him, eyes deep. "I can't leave the house, remember?"

"Yes, but somehow I thought it might just be a bad dream or something." Dean has to admit. "Like maybe you're just my imagination."

"If that's the case, wouldn't you try to imagine something nicer? A blonde girl or something? Why would you even make me up?" Castiel retorts, quietly glancing down to refer his trench coat covered figure.

The answer is unexpected. Dean frowns. "What's wrong with having you? You're nice -- enough."

Castiel smiles at that. "Thank you?"

Dean shrugs, leaving his office bag by the door, entering the kitchen to prepare his dinner and tomorrow's lunch. "Any time." He says.

<br>

The salad is quick to prepare, the chicken breast takes slightly longer. The online recipe says you can just heat them up in the microwave oven, if you don't want to spend time preheat the oven, so Dean just places them inside a glass container and puts a ten minute on the microwave oven.

He leans his back on the counter while waits. Castiel hovers around the fridge, looks like he's trying to see Dean cooking but doesn't want to make it apparent. His eyes jump around the places, glances moving from the spinning oven, Dean's hands, the counter, Dean's eyes, the sink, Dean's shoulder, the fridge door...

Dean breaks the silence. "So what did you do today? Anything interesting?"

"There is a bird outside of the window in the morning." Castiel looks at him in the eyes now. "I was worried that would be a window strike, but it turns out the bird was just curious to see what's inside the room, I think. I wonder if it saw me."

Dean amuses with a laughter. "Do you think it would get frightened if it found out you're a ghost?"

Castiel considers it. "I hope not. But do you think there are ghosts of birds after they die? Do they go to places where humans go, afterwards?"

"I don't know, man." Then the microwave oven dings. Dean lets the topic slip.

He moves his dinner to the living room, turning on the TV.

Castiel hesitates at the threshold between living room and dining room.

Dean takes a bite at the dinner, noticing the stare now. Scooting over on the sofa, leaving half the space empty. A silent invite.

It turns out ghosts can sit. Castiel sits on the empty space, carefully not touching the spaces taken by Dean. He looks at the TV.

There are some baseball game playing on it right now.

Dean looks at it, but soon finds he's totally not following the game. Not the points of the two sides, not even who are the two teams.

He glances at Castiel from the corner of his eyes. He clears the throat. "Did you use to watch games like this?"

"I don't watch sports often." Castiel tells him, "Jimmy was more interested, he used to take Amelia and Claire to the games if they happen to be in town and they have an available weekend. I think Claire loves it too."

"What do you watch then?" Dean finds himself curious to know.

"Mostly nature. I love seeing the creatures and plants, all the lives that exist and thrive without human intervention. Isn't it beautiful?" Castiel's eyes lose focus for a second, casting long and far. Dean wonders if he's reminded of the life when he was alive again.

"Yeah it does sound beautiful." He can't help answering. "Did you use to live alone? So having dinner alone, watching TV alone, go to bed alone?" He pauses there for a second, adding. "Sorry if it intrudes..."

"It's okay," Castiel answers gently. "It's not like a ghost has much privacy or secret that still worth protecting anyway." Dean opens his mouth want to disprove, but Castiel carries on. "Yes, I lives -- lived -- alone. But it's not bad at all, I enjoy the solitary. I'm close to my brother, but we still have our different lives."

"Yeah I'm same with my family." Dean tells him. "I have a little sister, Jo. Still in school, pain in the ass. We're close growing up, but now that I moved to this new city, we mostly just talk over the phone now. I'm okay with the room being quiet too, in fact sometimes I think this is the only quietness I could ever get when I finally don't have to share a room with that little monster."

Castiel chuckles. "I remember when Claire was much younger, we call her little monster too. Sometimes she would almost tear the whole room apart, the toys scattered everywhere, parts by parts, but other times she was just like a small angel." His voice gets lower. Dean knows exactly what's in his mind.

He turns to face him straight, telling him what he has already said yesterday, voice gentle. "We'll find him, Cas, whoever did this, they'll pay."

Cas nods. "Thank you."

<br>

Dean spends the rest of the night in front of the laptop.

The police can't find anything, which means it's a difficult as hell puzzle to solve. But a person can't just vanish in the thin air -- not when they're not ghost. Then the identity must be there, and the answer must be there.

Dean searches the traffic cameras in the surround area outside of the power outage zones. But the area range is too big, and the hour is not exactly late enough to limit the possibility of suspect. It is no different from looking for a needle in a bottle of hay.

But he still tries. He watches the footages, he notes down the car plates crossing the view around that time, he takes screenshots of people walking around the area that look remotely suspect. Meanwhile --

"You know, Cas, it would be so much easier if you can just remember the face when it all happened."

"I'm sorry, but the memory is still too fuzzy."

"But it's coming back though, right? You can remember more things today than before, I can see that."

"Yes, it seems to be so. But I don't know if it will ever be clear enough to identify the killer or if it would even work as any proof in the court, if we want to send him to prison for punishment."

"We'll figure something out."
