## Draft

(canon-divergent?, pre-S04E17->post-S04E17)

(tag: ghost Cas, S04E17, Dean Smith)

normal human non-hunter Dean (parents Bobby/Ellen, sister Jo, went to Stanford, sales director, 3 weeks in Sandover Bridge & Iron Inc.), move into new apartment which is haunted by ghost that turned out to be Cas

human Dean + ghost Cas -> freaked out for a bit (horror/suspension at beginning before turn out to reveal it's Cas), then ~domestic life -> Dean know about ghost & supernatural is real, help Cas revenge his death (whole family Jimmy/Amelia/Claire killed by Nick), finish his unfinished business (Dean thought) but Cas still not ghost, Dean puzzled (new unfinished business bc of Dean) -> S04E17 event, Cas help figure out the spirit, Dean get rid of it without Sam -> Zach confront, Dean Smith: "I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover"

(more fluff than horror)
