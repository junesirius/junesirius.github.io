This is why Dean doesn't have many one-night stands or female romantic/sexual relationships after S4:

Because if they do, every time he's topless, they'd see the handprint on his shoulder and they'd be curious. He can't say anything about Hell or anything real, so he'd have to have a more-or-less standard prepared story/explanation. Something like, "I almost died that time, and I was saved by this other guy. He grabbed me tight and raised me from there."

The girls would study the handprint and just have more questions, like "what's he like?" "did he risk his life for you?" "are you close?", and then, "do you love him?"

Dean can't say yes and he can't say no. He'd already lost interest in that girl on the bed, his mind all around Cas and his handprint, thinking about how Cas saved him, thinking about all those questions the girl asked and he had asked himself a million times -- Is that dangerous? Did Cas risk his own life to save him? Did he love him? His head would be overwhelmed again by the image of Cas's glazing eyes and thunderous lightening and wing shadows. And his mind would just get lost in the rabbit hole and that's the doom for his "supposedly fun night out".

So yeah, a couple of times like that, Dean stops taking any girl to bed completely. And the alternative becomes he staring at Cas's lips for longer and longer.
