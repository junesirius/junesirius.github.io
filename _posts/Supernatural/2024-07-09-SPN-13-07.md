> Dean: Kid was pretty spun out. We'll find him. I mean, there's gotta be a sign at some point, right?
>
> Sam: Yeah.
>
> Dean: Kid can cause a tsunami with a hiccup.
>
> Sam: I don't know. Maybe he's covering his tracks.
>
> Castiel enters the room from the opposite side Dean did.
>
> Castiel: Or this apparent dearth of evidence is, in fact, the evidence.
>
> Sam: The evidence of...
>
> Castiel: Of some horrific misadventure that's befallen him, like being dragged down to Hell by Asmodeus. Or... (sighs) I don't know, possibly worse, being hijacked to Heaven by angels.
>
> Dean: Yeah, but isn't he too fast and furious for angels?
>
> Castiel: Maybe. Maybe not. That's what I'm gonna find out.
>
> Sam: Find out from who? From - from the angels?
>
> Castiel: Yes.
>
> <u>Dean stands up.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>All right. Well, let's go.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Dean, you can't accompany me. My contact is already anxious about meeting and won't speak in the presence of a stranger.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>So introduce me. Then I'm not a stranger. I'll bring a six-pack.</u>
>
> Castiel: Dean, I swore I would protect this boy. Let me do this.
>
> Castiel walks toward the war room.
>
> Dean: <u>Don't do anything stupid.</u>
>
> <u>Dean reluctantly sits back down with Sam as we hear Castiel climb the stairs and leave through the front door.</u>

> Castiel: Dumah, thank you for agreeing to meet with me. This is a matter of -- of great urgency. It's imperative that I locate Jack.
>
> Dumah: You mean the nephilim.
>
> Castiel: Yes. Do the angels have him?
>
> Dumah: No.
>
> Castiel: Okay, you're certain that he's not maybe sitting in -- in Metatron's old cell or --
>
> Dumah: If we had him, he wouldn't be imprisoned. He would be put to work.
>
> Castiel: What do you mean?
>
> Dumah: Castiel, <u>the angels... Our numbers were greatly diminished after the fall. No one's made new angels since the dawn of creation. We're going extinct. You would need a powerful force to make more of us.</u>
>
> Castiel: You mean Jack. Even if he had that power, what makes you think he'd cooperate?
>
> Dumah: He may not have a choice.
>
> Castiel: So you're planning to enslave him for some kind of experiment?
>
> Dumah: Castiel, <u>he's not your pet. He belongs to all of us.</u>
>
> Two other angels come through the sandbox portal behind Dumah.
>
> First Angel: You did well, Dumah. You delivered him as promised. (to Castiel) We hear you have influence with the nephilim. He'll listen to you.
>
> Castiel: <u>No. I will not help you.</u>
>
> First Angel: Ever the renegade.
>
> Dumah: Castiel, please, come with us.
>
> Dumah takes Castiel by the wrist, but Castiel resists. He pushes her away, and they both deploy angel blades. <u>Castiel fights off all three angels, but Dumah comes up behind him and restrains him with an angel blade to his throat.</u>
>
> Lucifer: <u>Drop the blade, Dumah.</u>
>
> Dumah stares at Lucifer, but continues to hold the blade to Castiel's throat.
>
> Lucifer: You hesitate? This isn't gonna one of those "make my day" moments, is it? Okay. Buh-bye.
>
> Lucifer stands up straight and his eyes glow red. Dumah releases Castiel and flees back to heaven through the sandbox portal with the other two angels. <u>When they're gone, Lucifer sits heavily on a bench, coughing and wheezing at the expenditure of power.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>What are you doing back in this world?</u>
>
> Lucifer: <u>What are you doing alive?</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>It's complicated.</u>
>
> Lucifer: <u>Same here. Obviously, getting here took its toll.</u>
>
> Castiel: You're weak.
>
> Lucifer: Yeah, I'm clearly not myself. (Castiel is going to charge towards Lucifer) But, oh, cowboy, I'm not that weak. And you and I need to talk.
>
> Castiel: I have no interest in talking to you. And if this is about your son --
>
> Lucifer: Okay, I get it, I get it. <u>Custody of my son is a non-starter.</u> But if you can please just shelve the eternal enemies thing for a second, we have a situation. And by "we," I mean everything alive. We're sorta... all gonna die.

>*INT. NICK'S BAR - NIGHT*
>
>Castiel and Lucifer sit across a table from one another as other patrons play pool.
>
>Lucifer: Everything I am telling you is true. You were there, man. You saw what that place was like. The Michael I just described to you is responsible for that.
>
><u>Castiel looks uncomfortable, his eyes everywhere but on Lucifer.</u>
>
>Lucifer: <u>What? What? What? What? Will you -- will you do me a favor and stop looking at the door every five seconds like you wanna get outta here?</u>
>
>Castiel: <u>You'll forgive me if I'm a little on edge. The last time we were together, you killed me.</u>
>
>Lucifer: Well, <u>last time we were together, you stabbed me.</u>
>
>Castiel: <u>(rolling his eyes and sighing) I'm sorry.</u>
>
>Lucifer: You wanna dwell on the past? I don't. I'm not myself anyway. What am I gonna do? Okay? Look, <u>it's time to save the world. Be the heroic Castiel instead of the butt of Heaven's joke.</u>
>
>Castiel: <u>I am not the b--</u>
>
>Lucifer: I'm, you know, just sayin'.
>
>Castiel: Okay. How do I save the world?
>
>Lucifer: We. We, save the world.
>
>Castiel: Oh, no.
>
>Lucifer: Yeah, yeah. Look, you protected my son. He trusts you. If you can convince him to be on our team, I think the combined power of the three of us can drive Michael back. I'm telling you, this guy is not the same Michael that we knew. He's much more powerful.
>
>Castiel: Okay, if this Michael come --
>
>Lucifer: Not if. When. When. The guy's on a mission.
>
>Castiel: Well, <u>you would seem to be the weak link on this team.</u>
>
>Lucifer: <u>Okay, that hurt. That... was unnecessary. I'm gonna let it go.</u> Yes, my grace is a little bit depleted, but give me time, man. Work this out with me.
>
>Castiel: <u>Hypothetically, um, let's say you're lying, and I help you find your son, and then you kill me again.</u>
>
>Lucifer: Cut me a little bit of slack. Please? That unhinged thing and that meth head Kevin Tran are about to bust through that door. God isn't here! It's just us.
>
>Castiel sighs deeply.
>
>Lucifer: We're all we got, in case you hadn't noticed.
>
>Castiel: Well, <u>I-I-I have to talk to Sam and Dean.</u>
>
>Lucifer: <u>(groaning and banging his forehead against the table) Why, why, why, why, why, with all their second guessing and their whining? This is an emergency, Castiel, and all they're gonna wanna do is -- is put me back in the Cage.</u>
>
>Castiel: <u>That's all I want.</u>
>
>Lucifer: But right now, you need me, I need you, and we both need my son. Look, not changing the subject, but we'll get back to it. I just wanna ask you, how did you hide him so well? I mean, I tried to get a bead on him, and no bueno.
>
>Castiel: Jack. Your son's name is Jack.
>
>Lucifer: Jack. Wow. <u>Is he... (chuckles) awesome? I mean, is he a chip off the old block?</u>
>
>Castiel: Thankfully, no. No, he seems to favor the mother.
>
>Lucifer: All right, that's nothing that we can't fix. But seriously, I mean, why can't I... you know, detect a presence?
>
>Castiel: I don't know. He...
>
>Lucifer: He is okay, though, right?
>
>Castiel: Oh, I'm sure he's fine.
>
>Lucifer: Well, you don't sound sure. Is he -- is he nearby?
>
>Castiel: No.
>
>Lucifer: Somewhere more distant?
>
>Castiel: Yes, more that.
>
>Lucifer: <u>Oh, my Dad. You have no idea where he is.</u>

> Sam clears his throat, shuts his laptop, and gets up to escort Ketch out of the library. <u>Dean dials his phone. Castiel answers, having left Lucifer's table for privacy.</u> He's standing by the "Gents" door in Nick's Bar.
>
> Dean: (over the phone) Cass, any news on Jack? We need to find him fast.
>
> Castiel: Nothing yet, but... interesting things are happening. We...
>
> Dean: What?
>
> Castiel: (noticing Lucifer is standing beside him) <u>Yes,</u> (cut to the bunker, as Dean makes a face of surprise and confusion as Castiel suddenly changes subject) <u>I would like to see you, too, the sooner the better.</u>
>
> Lucifer: Cass? You know, smooth was never your strong suit.

> Dean: Yeah. <u>How we looking? You still got a lock on Cass's signal?</u>
>
> SAM: Sure do. I nailed down his location. He's not much further, so... <u>Don't worry. You did tell him not to do anything stupid.</u>

> Back at Nick's bar with Lucifer and Castiel, they're now sitting at the bar, *Blues Are Turning Black* by Stephen Emil Dudas plays in the background.
>
> Lucifer: It's bad enough the Winchesters were babysitting my son, but then they managed to lose him? With Heaven, Hell, and everything in between hunting him down?
>
> Castiel: <u>In their defense, they were doing their best to educate him.</u>
>
> Lucifer: About what?! <u>What could they possibly know about an entity like Jack? About his potential?</u>
>
