> Dean's trying to plan Cas's birthday, when Jody calls Dean to ask if he and Cas have time to come over to help. Dean initially planed to prepare Cas a birthday setting in the bunker, thinks Jody has a case so they have to work, so Dean has to give up his plan unhappily, goes to Jody's with Cas. Only to find it's actually Claire tries to give Cas a surprise birthday party but too shy to tell Cas directly, so she made Jody make the call. So in the end all of them give Cas a birthday at Jody's.

> (where is Sam and Jack? working on something else somewhere else? Sam teasing Dean to be pining/sassy to be pining but still doesn't dare to confess and be together with Cas? Dean was initially planning to make some big move in Cas's birthday and not plan disrupted?)
>
> (something wrong with the cake or something small? easy to fix, but supernaturally wrong, like something in local grocery shop goes wrong when they go to buy something last minute (Jody sends them out just so keep them out of kitchen for a minute), so it's still a case and a job (djinn job? mess up with dream world), but one that's relatively easy to fix. Dean/Cas have a moment in the shop to fix it, BAMF Cas moment, Dean appreciates, lovable moment)

> (double dream setting? Dean wakes up from the dream in Jody's house, being alone in the bunker bedroom, remembering the reality is Cas is gone to Empty, Dean goes to look for Cas, goes to dungeon and remembers, sees black goo and God of Time telling him prophecy again?; Dean startles awake from that dream again, realizing the reality is Cas is back from Empty, they're together and retired, and it's Cas's birthday again, he's just too worried he'd mess Cas's birthday and having nightmare again first time in years, Cas comforts him, they cuddle a bit, Dean tries to cover up by suggesting inviting Jody/Claire over for the party, they'd go get cake and call Jody/Claire just in a bit after sun's up, right now it's cuddling time, Dean stays lazy and in Cas's arms)
