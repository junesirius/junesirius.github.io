Summary: For once, Dean tries to prepare a proper birthday surprise for Cas. That's before a phone call disrupts his plan.

<br>

Dean is biting a pencil and staring at a piece of paper with a frown when Sam passes the war room on his way to the stairs. Sam detours toward him, and Dean looks up.

"You going out?"

"What're you working on?"

They speak at the same time.

Dean blinks. "Shopping list," he answers briefly.

"Hm," Sam makes a funny sound through his nose. "We had a grocery run just yesterday. The fridge is so full it can barely close," he points out.

Dean scrunches his nose. "What? I can't go shopping for something other than groceries?"

Sam raises his eyebrows. "Except you never did," he studies Dean's face for a second, "but sure." He shrugs, and resumes his path toward the door.

"Where are you going?" Dean stares at his back.

Sam rubs the back of his neck. "Eileen called," he says. That's not really an answer, but enough information leaks. "Don't wait for me for dinner," he amends quickly, rubbing his cheek.

Dean's the one raising his eyebrows this time. "O--kay--" he says with stretched syllables. "Enjoy your little date, lover boy," he mocks.

Sam gives him a bitch face. "Shut up," he shoots, quickly glancing around the space. "Thought you'd be glad I leave you two alone. Speaking of, where's Cas?"

Dean's eyes drift away from Sam, falling back to the piece of paper before him. "You know him -- not an early bird," he answers vaguely.

Sam rolls his eyes. "It's past noon, Dean." He stifles a laugh in his throat, checking his watch. "In fact, it's almost two. What have you done that could possibly exhaust him like that? You know what, don't answer that. I don't wanna know." He retreats quickly toward the stairs.

Dean glares at him. "Shut up, bitch."

"Jerk," Sam answers automatically. The end of the syllable is eaten by a thump of the door closing.

The room falls back to silence when the echo dies down.

Dean slumps back into the chair, and continues biting the pencil.

<br>

The magic of the silence is broken by the vibration of his phone in less than ten minutes.

Dean picks up absent-mindedly.

Jody's voice comes out of the phone. "You got any plan for the rest of the day?" she asks straightforwardly.

Dean stares at the ether ten inches before him, a soft moan escaping his throat. "What's wrong, Jody?" Without answering, he asks instead.

Jody pauses for a second before answering, "We... might get ourselves into a situation. It would be nice if you could drop by. Cas, too."

Dean tenses. "What kind of a situation? Monsters? Anyone hurt, you, Claire?"

"No, nothing like that," Jody says quickly. "It's easier to explain if you and Cas can just come over."

"The fastest I can do is get there in about four hours," Dean checks his watch. Sam is right, it's almost two.

"That works," Jody answers, a little too cheerfully in the tone. There's some noise in her background, someone talking, but it's too vague to tell.

Dean frowns in confusion. "Everything okay there?"

"Yeah, nothing to worry," Jody reassures him. "Just, come. See you in a bit. Don't forget to bring Cas with you!"

She hangs up.

Dean stares at the hung-up phone screen for a second too long with a light frown. He shrugs to himself after that second ended, and turns to the corridor leading to their bedroom.

His shopping list is left forgotten on the war room table.

The first item reads: *birthday cake.*

Followed by a list of other things: *popcorn, paper hat, flower, wine, candle...*

And at the very bottom of the paper, a word is circled around multiple times, overstruck, underlined, decorated, followed by a question mark.

The word is: *ring?*

<br>

"There is no missing people report in Sioux Falls in months," Cas reports, scrolling his phone on the passenger's seat. It takes Dean five years to teach him how to use technologies, including but not limited to smartphones, laptops, TVs, and coffee machines. And Cas is getting as familiar with them as any human their age, especially with the phone.

"Neither is there any demon signs. Tonight is not full-moon, either." Cas frowns slightly.

"Jody did say it was not a monster situation, just *'a situation'* -- whatever that means." Dean glances at him quickly. Cas is in his usual clean button-up shirt and suits, but he leaves the trench coat folded on his lap. The September air is still a little heated outside in Kansas under the afternoon sun.

Dean continues, "And she seemed very insistent about you coming along. So I'd guess it might be something to do with you."

"Angels?" Cas prompts, the crease between his eyebrows growing deeper.

Dean shrugs lightly. "Hope not."

Cas presses off the phone screen, slides it back into his pocket, and leans back into the seat, relaxing against the leather. "Well, it's not like we have any plan or job for the rest of the day anyway," he considers. "I haven't met Jody or Claire for a while now; it would be nice to see them, too."

Dean casts him another glance, and hums noncommittally.

<br>

Jody's house is quiet when they pull over. Though Dean can swear he sees a flash of shadow behind the curtain.

He steps up the doorsteps gingerly, gesturing Cas to follow behind him.

"If there is any danger in there, I should be the one --" Cas whispers, half a step behind.

"Shhh --" Dean shushes him, putting an index finger to his mouth, giving Cas a nod, and then approaches the door.

He knuckles the door three times with his left hand, his right hand resting on his hip, a split second away from the gun on his belt if needed.

The door snaps open with an explosion of tiny, colorful streamers and confetti. Right on Dean and Cas's faces.

Dean blinks, wiping his face as if he was just poured a bucket of ice water from the head -- a bucket of colorful confetti, actually, not too far from the truth. Cas is doing the same, from the sound of clothes shifting.

"What the hell?" Dean bursts out.

"Happy birthday!" Claire jumps before them, as if popping out from the thin air.

"Whose birthday?" Cas asks flatly.

"Not mine," Dean answers automatically, staring at Claire for a second before the frown turns into a small smile with realization. He steps across the doorframe, half turning back to look at Cas with a curve pulling the tips of his lips.

Claire looks at Cas with widened eyes, "Yours, of course, Cas."

Cas follows Dean into the house, while still trying to shrug the remaining confetti off his shoulder. "I wasn't aware," he says slowly. "Angels don't have a date of birth, or we don't remember. It would have been millions of years ago, before the invention of the human annal calendar system. I sincerely doubt it would so coincidentally happen on September the Eighteenth. But nonetheless, I appreciate it."

"Ask him," Claire points at Dean. "He's the one said this is the day."

"When did I --?" Dean narrows his eyes. "-- Oh."

Cas eyes him. "Why today, Dean?"

Dean meets his eyes. "You walked the Earth for the first time like this, seventeen years ago today."

"I remember," Cas answers gently, a smile tugging at his lips. "That was the day we met for the first time, in that barn. But that was hardly the day I was born, you know that, right?"

Dean lets out a small huff of laugh, lowering his eyes. "From my definition -- from human definition -- the day of birth is the day you come to the Earth. So yeah, technically, that *was* your birthday. And technically, you were like, seventeen this year -- not voting age yet." He chuckles softly.

Cas tilts his head in consideration. "Alright," he approves eventually.

Jody claps her hands behind them. "Great, now that the most important matter is settled, shall we go and get seated? Dinner is going to be cold if you keep standing in my doorway forever."

Dean pivots to her sharply. "I thought you said you got a situation!"

"We do." Jody gestures to the dinner table full of plates with steaming food and the scattered fragments of confetti on the floor. "Welcome to the situation."

Dean huffs out a quiet laugh. "We were worried it might be monsters or some cases. I rushed the four-hour drive to three and a half."

"I told you we were okay." Jody looks away, turning around to walk toward the dinner table, smoothing the tablecloth. "At least I'm glad we didn't disturb any plan or anything."

"Yeah, about that," Dean says plainly.

Jody looks at him over her shoulder in surprise. "You do?"

Dean's mouth twitches faintly. "Doesn't matter now."

Jody puts up two hands. "Sorry about that. But don't give me the look, not my idea to start with. Someone missed Cas so much and was too shy to send out the invitation directly. I had to be the one making the phone call and be careful not to spoil all the fun."

"Jody!" Claire says loudly, feet shifting uneasily, staring at the floor.

Dean glances at her, surprised. "Huh."

Cas turns to Claire fully, landing a hand on her shoulder. "Claire," he says sincerely with a low voice. "Thank you! For preparing this for me."

Claire swallows, averts her eyes, and glances around. Her hands fly around, making wild gestures all over the place, toward somewhere behind them or somewhere near the ceiling. "I got you a gift too, but if we're doing things the right way, you need to wait after the cake and the song."

Cas nods solemnly. "I can wait." And once again, "Thank you."

Dean chuckles quietly beside them. "Of course there'd be cake and song. And candles?"

"Crap, I forgot the candles. How many do we need?" Claire curses under her breath, glancing at Dean with panic in her eyes. "You said seventeen years. I don't think we have seventeen. Dean, do you think you can grab some from the store real quick?"

"I don't think we really need --" Cas starts, hesitant.

"Yeah, sure," Dean answers rapidly, darting a look at Cas. "Gotta make it perfect for the angel, am I right?"

He turns to the door.

"I can go with you," Cas offers behind him, reaching out to grab his hand. Their fingers brush for a second.

Dean glances over his shoulder with a warm smile, squeezing his finger before letting go. "Nah, I'd be back in ten. You bond with Claire and... braid hair or something. Just, don't finish all the cake before I'm back."

"I will wait for you," Cas promises him with a solemn nod.

Dean leaves the house.

<br>

The closest retail store is just around the corner, barely two blocks away.

It's within walking distance, but Dean drives anyway. Anything to go back to Cas quickly.

He is just walking past the baking aisle when the lights on the store ceiling all start flashing and fluttering. The fluorescent lamps blink off for a beat or two, shivering unstably, then snap back to light. A few seconds later, it happens again. And again.

Dean glances around. The other customers in the store don't seem to be bothered, just picking items from aisles and moving them to the baskets or carts, as if nothing unusual just happened.

Dean shifts his stance, moving to the next aisle in a trained gait, his fingers twitching loosely around the handle of the pistol belted at his back.

There is a guy standing in the party supply aisle, where the candles are. A pale, young man with blue tattoos wildly spreading on his bare skin, covering his face to his arms. He doesn't seem to notice Dean's presence. His fingers linger on something on the shelf, as if just another customer, can't decide which greeting card to buy.

Dean holds the gun in his hands, waiting at the turn of the aisle.

"What are you waiting for, Dean?" The man turns to where Dean stands. His eyes flash electrical blue, and the patterns on his face and arms are lit up at the same time as if they're alive.

"You're a djinn," Dean states plainly, approaching him cautiously.

The djinn shrugs, as if saying without words, *Obviously.*

"Why are you here?" Dean can't help but ask. "This is not how djinns kill," he points out.

The light overhead glitters again. "And djinns don't affect electricity." Dean frowns deeply. Something is wrong, like fundamentally wrong, but he can't put a name to it. He grasps the gun tighter.

The djinn looks into his eyes calmly. "But angels do."

Before Dean can react, a flush of wind and the sound of fluttering wings announce Cas's arrival.

"Dean," Cas says grimly, his eyes locked on him, appearing behind the djinn, laying a palm on his skull.

The creature doesn't waver. "Dean, how sure are you that this is real?"

"Cas, wait --" Dean blurts out, but the overwhelmingly bright glow of grace light already pours out from Cas's palm. His eyes light up at the same time.

Dean covers his eyes with the curve of his elbow. When he lowers his arm, the djinn is just a small pile of burned ash on the floor. Cas's eyes are cooling down like newly ignited firewood, turning back to ice-blue in seconds, before his eyes.

"Are you alright, Dean?" Cas rushes to him, worried and caring. "Did he hurt you?"

"No," Dean answers dumbly, watching him attentively without blinking. His fingers loosen. The gun falls to the floor.

*How sure are you that this is real?*

Cas scrutinizes his face, a hand brushing gently against his cheek. "You don't look very well."

Dean closes his eyes, leaning to the touch. He shakes his head, wordless.

*How sure are you that this is real?*

A touch of warm lips fall on his forehead. Gentle, careful, as if touching something delicate.

"Better?" Cas's breath passes softly by his ear. His chest vibrates as he speaks.

Dean clutches his wrist, clinging closer. Can't help it.

*How sure are you that this is real?*

Dean lets out a shattered breath. "We don't need candles for the cake," he says, voice shaken.

"Okay," Cas answers quietly, still holding Dean in his arms.

Dean forces his eyes open. "Because there is no cake. And you're not here."

He cracks a broken smile. As pale and bleeding as a lone bloody-red rose standing in the snow.

"That's just djinn talking," Cas says, voice patient. "He's gone."

Dean looks into his eyes, his own glinting with tears. "So are you."

<br>

Dean snaps awake from the bed, breathing heavily. The corners of his eyes are wet.

*No.*

He clutches his chest, feeling it too tight to breathe through. His chest heaves and falls violently. His heart beats unsteadily under his rib bones.

His hand reaches up, idling near his jaw, the places where the ghostly touch still lingers. He takes a slow breath in, and breathes it out.

His days-old stubble prickles his own palm. He already forgets the feeling of that kiss on his forehead.

"Cas," Dean whispers, to the dark air in his room. The air in the bunker is too heavy, too dull, too suffocating.

He stumbles into a chair on his way out of his room, and almost trips over a step on his way down the stairs, down to the dungeon.

The bunker is quiet in the middle of the night. All the corridors are empty. Too quiet, too empty, too deadly.

The dungeon is as still and silent as the rest of the bunker. One pathetic light bulb dangles on the ceiling, leaving more dark shadows than light in the room. The demon trap remains the same in the center of the floor, so is the only chair at the end of the room.

Dean finds his green jacket on the floor, at the edge of the wall. Where he was shoved and crushed. Where he sat and cried and prayed for a whole night. And Cas didn't come back.

"No," his lips quiver.

"No, no, no, no, no." He rushes to it. His knees give way when he reaches the wall. He falls down abruptly, clenching the jacket in his fists.

Cas's bloody handprint still looks fresh on the shoulder of the jacket.

"Cas, Cas --" Dean whimpers, breathless.

*No, no, no, no, no --*

The memory of Cas's last moment crushing onto him like the wave of a tsunami, and he is the tiny human being buried under the surface. Drowning, falling, breaking apart.

"Cas, Cas, come back, come back to me -- Please."

<br>

"I'm here, Dean. Wake up. I'm right here." Cas shakes his shoulder gently, and Dean starts awake. He realizes his body is shaking like a leaf, as if he's been sobbing all this time. Cas's arms surround him, their chests touching.

"Cas," Dean tries. His voice raspy.

"I'm here, Dean. I'm here. It's just a dream." Cas leans in, holding him tighter. His cheek rests on top of Dean's head.

Faint light of early morning sky passes through the window blinds, leaving striped light and shadow in the room.

"Where are we?" Dean asks breathily.

"Our home. San Clemente, California," Cas answers in a low murmur. His palms draw small, soothing circles on Dean's back.

Dean angles his head, nestling in the hollow between Cas's chin and neck, pressing his forehead against the warm skin near his Adam's Apple. His eyelids fall slowly closed again.

His hands come around Cas's waist comfortably, like they belong there and they've belonged to the dips and the curves since the beginning of time. His legs are tangled with the angel's under the cover, before he remembers that's exactly how they were when he fell asleep the night before.

"When?" Dean's breath comes out smoother.

"September the Eighteenth, Two thousand and Twenty-Five," Cas answers patiently.

Dean's eyes fly open. "September the Eighteenth."

"Yes," Cas answers automatically, starting to frown mildly at his tone. His arms loosen slightly, in an attempt to pull away an inch to look at Dean's face.

Dean says slowly again, "It's today."

Cas doesn't follow, but he answers anyway, "Yes."

Dean lets out a small chuckle, but the sound is uneven. "I was just dreaming about today."

Cas raises his head from the pillow mountain an inch, tilting his head. "I thought you were having a nightmare when I woke you up."

"Yeah, that too," Dean's eyes follow the move. "It started okay -- actually pretty nice, you, me, Jody, Claire. Claire threw you a birthday party, there's cake and everything. But then it just turned bad." His voice falls quieter, before he forces a shallow chuckle. "You know what, I must be subconsciously stressed out about your birthday or something. Got something to prepare, you know -- it's your big day. Don't let my stupid dream ruin your happy day -- hasn't happened for years..."

Cas's fingers trace his jawline gently. "Dean," he starts slowly. Dean abruptly stops his babbling, glancing up at him, his eyes running right into Cas's gaze.

Cas shifts a little in the bed, so their eyes level. He continues quietly, "I never quite understand why you take this day as my birthday --"

"Told you before, it was the day you walked the Earth," Dean can't help chiming in.

"Yes. But it was also so much more than that," Cas says thoughtfully.

"What do you mean?"

"It was the day these eyes had the sight of you, these lips breathed the same air as you, these voice and words were heard by your ears. Dean, seventeen years ago, it was the day I met you, and it was the day I started to have a real, meaningful *life*. Life and meaning came to me, so it was *truly* the day I was born. You showed me life, you *gave* me life. That was how I was born. And I finally understand, for that, this day unquestionably deserves commemoration and celebration."

Cas finishes, and his eyes look at Dean with so much intense emotion overflowing from them that tears glint at the corners, threatening to roll down.

Dean swallows. He pulls Cas down, and presses his lips at the corner of his one eye, and the other, kissing the tears away.

He takes a unsteady breath, and whispers, "I love you, too. So much. You saved my life, too, so many times."

Cas blinks, then answers with a straight face, "We're not going to make all of them our birthdays, are we? It might become too many."

Dean laughs. He laughs so hysterically that he untangles his legs and curls up like a ball, the sound of his laugh trembling and vibrating in his chest, shaking the bed. "There I was, thinking it's just about cakes and balloons --"

"-- Shit. The cake." Dean's laugh jolts to a stop.

"What is it?" Cas tenses.

Dean throws himself back into the deepest pit inside the pillow mountains, buries his face in them. "Almost forgot, I still have to go shopping. The dream messed me up -- thought I already did it." He flashes a grinning look at Cas. "There's something I need to prepare."

Cas opens his mouth and quickly closes it, glances at Dean sheepishly once, and opens it again. "I, uh, may have accidentally seen your shopping list yesterday."

"Oh," Dean blinks slowly, pulling himself up from the pillows.

"And I have a question," Cas says carefully.

Dean stills, the smile disappearing quickly. "Yes?"

Cas looks into his eyes. "Why is there a question mark?"

Dean huffs out a loud laugh in relief. "You're right. Yeah, totally shouldn't."

They fall back to the comfortable, lazy cuddling position.

The sun is not completely up yet.

"I should probably give Jody and Claire a call later," Dean says with eyes closed.

Cas hums in agreement.

"When do you think Sam and Eileen would arrive? We'd have enough time to prepare before they're here?" Dean voices again.

"They'll call," Cas mumbles.

"And Jack, do you think he'll come this time?" Dean asks again.

Cas lets out a small sigh. "Dean," he grumbles, leaning in to peck on those chatty lips once, "will you shut that beautiful mouth up and let us just lie down like this quietly for a few more moments before getting up?"

"Bossy," Dean laughs quietly, biting his lower lip. "Always know you're an angry sleeper."

"Dean --"

"Yeah, alright, Cas, I can shut up -- if you let me say one more thing."

"Okay."

"Happy birthday, Cas."

They don't know whose arms wrap tighter, or who starts the kiss this time.

They do know neither of them wants any of it to stop, for eternity.

And this time, they can have -- they are already having -- all that they would ever want.

<br>

(**Words after work:** Dean never finds out what the birthday gift that Claire prepared for Cas is -- it's a bigger version of the grumpy cat, just like the one Cas gave her to compensate for her birthday.

I really love the idea of Claire giving Cas a birthday party and asking Jody to make the phone call. The rest of the story grows on its own accord, out of my control. I believe they will have a real birthday party at Jody's place sometime.

In case it's not clear enough, in the eventual reality, Dean and Cas are having a happy retirement life, living in their house, near the sea. Sam and Eileen would visit sometime. Everyone is happy.)
