(The cut scene from S15E15 where Cas takes out a photo of himself, bent in the middle)

I'd seen this screenshot a million times and crazy this is the first time I realize the edge of the photo isn't even. So it was actually a full-frame photo, with Dean supposedly right by Cas's side, just like we saw from the episode. (still wondering how Dean got it in the first place, asked Sam or someone else to take it for them?)

And DEAN CUTS HIMSELF OUT MANUALLY, so he can have a photo of Cas alone and keep it in his wallet...

I don't know what to say. Is that the self-hatred that he doesn't like to see himself, feeling unworthy standing next to Cas, or just purely only having enough attention to admire Cas in a cowboy hat?

<br>

And forever thinking about how it's so bent and worn in the middle, and it's folded inwards so Cas's face is hidden, so people won't see it immediately when he opens his wallet in public to pay for something or grab a fake ID. But he'd fold it and unfold it in sleepless nights, especially during S15 divorce curve.

Or, maybe he only starts folding it up after S15 divorce curve because it pains him to remember their big fight, his heart hurts too much seeing Cas's photo without him around in person, so he folds it in half. It used to be unfolded and just show there so he can always see immediately when he opens his wallet, which makes him very cautious of using his wallet in public, always very quickly and keep it hidden. (Now I have to watch every episode after 13x06 again to look for scenes when Dean uses his wallet)
