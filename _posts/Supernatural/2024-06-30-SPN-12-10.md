难得看见小情侣吵架了，从冷战到冷嘲热讽阴阳怪气全套集齐，但是出现外来威胁时仍然一瞬间就忘记之前还在生气一致对外了，到最后也说开和好了。中间有一句很喜欢的是Dean说“我们虽然偶尔会有意见不合but Cass knows who his real friend is”，两个人不管怎么吵架发脾气出现conflict，彼此对对方都有足够的信心，知道对方不会因此对他们之间的关系基础产生动摇，所有摩擦不合只是一种帮助关系变得更好的磨合。

当然知道文艺作品不可避免会对人际关系的交往模式进行美化，可仍然不可避免地羡慕这样的关系，这样的对彼此的信心，是非常健康又坚定的关系了。继而反思自己的人际关系，思考conflict这件事，试着回忆上一次跟人有真正的conflict然后处理好的例子，然后发现怎么都想不出来，感到至少在近五年都没有过的，突然感到这件事其实也是很有问题。习惯性地因为太过害怕conflict的产生所以极力避免，大部分时候的处理方式都是温驯地让步或者在不知不觉的冷战中结束一段关系，这完全不是健康的人际关系应对方式。

想到的例子大多是同网友的，但对现实关系似乎也适用，只感到自己越来越容易把朋友当做一段dispensable的关系，在每一段开始时就做好了它们会消失的准备，在隐约察觉到conflict开始积累时就开始准备后退，拉开距离，直到越来越生疏，直到不再说话，于是也顺利避免冲突的爆发。哪怕这冲突可能可以被解决，解决时候可以让这段关系变得更好，可似乎已经做不到拥有那样的信心了，潜意识的总会默认冲突会让这关系恶化，于是索性不进行尝试了。感觉真是很糟糕的习惯，又很无奈地不太敢做出改变，所以哪怕意识到了问题也没有什么用……

> *THEN* (S04E02)
>
> Sam is asleep on the couch. Dean is asleep on the floor nearby and wakes up to find Castiel standing in the kitchen. Dean checks on Sam, sees he is asleep, and walks over to join Castiel.
>
> Castiel: Excellent job with the witnesses.
>
> Dean: You were hip to all this?
>
> Castiel: <u>I was, uh, made aware.</u>
>
> Dean: Well, thanks a lot for the angelic assistance. You know, I almost got my heart ripped out of my chest.
>
> Castiel: But you didn't.
>
> Dean: <u>I thought angels were supposed to be guardians. Fluffy wings, halos -- you know, Michael Landon. Not dicks.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Read the Bible. Angels are warriors of God. I'm a soldier.</u>
>
> Dean: Yeah? Then, why didn't you fight?
>
> Castiel: <u>I'm not here to perch on your shoulder.</u> We had larger concerns.
>
> Dean: Concerns? There were people getting torn to shreds down here! And, by the way, while all this is going on, where the hell is your boss, huh, if there is a God?
>
> Castiel: There's a God.
>
> Dean: I'm not convinced. 'Cause if there's a God, what the hell is he waiting for, huh? Genocide? Monsters roaming the earth? The freaking apocalypse? At what point does he lift a damn finger and help the poor bastards that are stuck down here?
>
> Castiel: The Lord works...
>
> Dean: <u>If you say "mysterious ways," so help me, I will kick your ass.</u> So, Bobby was right... about the witnesses. This is some kind of a... sign of the apocalypse.
>
> Castiel: That's why we're here. Big things afoot.
>
> Dean: Do I want to know what kind of things?
>
> Castiel: I sincerely doubt it, but you need to know. The rising of the witnesses is one of the 66 seals.
>
> Dean: Okay. I'm guessing that's not a show at Seaworld.
>
> Castiel: Those seals are being broken by Lilith.
>
> Dean: She did the spell. She rose the witnesses.
>
> Castiel: Mm-hmm. And not just here. 20 other hunters are dead.
>
> Dean: Of course. She picked victims that the hunters couldn't save so that they would barrel right after us.
>
> Castiel: Lilith has a certain sense of humor.
>
> Dean: Well, we put those spirits back to rest.
>
> Castiel: It doesn't matter. The seal was broken.
>
> Dean: Why break the seal anyway?
>
> Castiel: You think of the seals as locks on a door.
>
> Dean: Okay. Last one opens and...
>
> Castiel: Lucifer walks free.
>
> Dean: Lucifer? But I thought Lucifer was just a story they told at demon Sunday school. There's no such thing.
>
> Castiel: <u>Three days ago, you thought there was no such thing as me. Why do you think we're here walking among you now for the first time in 2,000 years?</u>
>
> Dean: To stop Lucifer.
>
> Castiel: That's why we've arrived.
>
> Dean: Well... bang-up job so far. Stellar work with the witnesses. That's nice.
>
> Castiel: We tried. And there are other battles, other seals. Some we'll win, some we'll lose. This one we lost. Our numbers are not unlimited. Six of my brothers died in the field this week. <u>You think the armies of Heaven should just follow you around? There's a bigger picture here. You should show me some respect. I dragged you out of Hell. I can throw you back in.</u>
>
> Castiel vanishes, leaving Dean alone in the kitchen. Later Dean wakes up.

> Sam: You talk to Cass yet?
>
> Dean: <u>No.</u>
>
> Sam: <u>So, what, you're just gonna keep walking past each other in the kitchen, not saying a word?</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Maybe.</u>
>
> Sam: Look, yes, Cass killed Billie, but he saved us. He saved Mom. How long are you gonna stay pissed?
>
> Dean: I'm not pissed that he cares about us, you know. I'm -- I'm grateful. But Billie said there would be "cosmic consequences" if that deal got broken. You have any idea what that means?
>
> Sam: No.
>
> Dean: Neither do I, but I'm pretty sure it ain't jellybeans and g-strings.
>
> Sam: My point is, Cass thought he was doing the right thing.
>
> Cass: <u>I was doing the right thing.</u>
>
> Cass walks up to Sam and Dean.
>
> Dean: <u>You sure about that?</u>
>
> Cass: <u>Yes.</u>
>
> Dean: Yeah? Well, I'm not so sure. And when the other shoe drops --
>
> Cass: I'll deal with it.

> Cass: I have to go.
>
> Sam: Got a lead on Kelly?
>
> Cass: No. This is personal.
>
> Dean: <u>Meaning what?</u>
>
> Cass: Another angel. An old friend. He called out for help.
>
> Dean: Oh. <u>Good old reliable angel radio.</u>
>
> Cass: He was begging for help and then he just stopped. I need to know if he's still alive.
>
> Sam: Yeah, all right. Well... we'll come with you.
>
> Cass: <u>Both of you?</u>
>
> <u>Cass looks at Dean.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Sure. Yeah, we could help. Gotta make sure you don't do anything else stupid.</u>

> In the impala where it's quiet and awkward with the only sound being the engine of the impala.
>
> Sam: <u>All right, who wants music?</u>
>
> Dean: I'm good.
>
> Sam: You? Okay. Cass, is there anything specific we should know about your friend?
>
> <u>More silence. Sam looks around and shakes his head.</u>
>
> Sam: <u>All right. Guys, you know what? This -- this silent treatment thing, it's silly. It's not gonna work.</u> Whatever we're walking into, we should, you know, probably have an actual plan.
>
> Cass: (sighs) What do you wanna know?
>
> Dean: <u>Oh, he speaks.</u>
>
> Sam: Enough. Cass, you said when you heard Benjamin, he -- he was screaming.
>
> Cass: It was, um... Look, Benjamin wouldn't call for help lightly. And he wouldn't put himself in harm's way if he could help it.
>
> Dean: <u>Wow, this Benjamin seems like he's pretty cool, you know. Like he wouldn't make any half-cocked, knee-jerk choices.</u>
>
> Cass: <u>Yeah, you know what I like about him? Is that he's sarcastic, but he's thoughtful and appreciative, too.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Now what is that supposed to mean? (looks back at Cass)</u>
>
> Sam: <u>Okay, okay, the road, road. Dude, watch the road.</u>
>
> Dean: I got it.

> MAN: Sure, yeah. That's the official story. I mean, I was outside, and... Dead woman? No blood? Come on. And these crazy burn marks? It's a cult thing, right? That's why the FBI's -
>
> Cass: <u>Get out.</u>
>
> MAN: What?
>
> Cass: <u>Get out.</u>
>
> Dean: He means we can take it from here. Thanks.
>
> MAN: Yeah.
>
> Dean: We'll call you when we're done.
>
> Sam: <u>Dude. You all right?</u>
>
> Cass: <u>No. No</u>, Benjamin and I, we fought together. He was... he was a gifted soldier. I don't know how this could've happened.

> Sam: All right, who we meetin'?
>
> Cass: His name is Ishim. Before I, uh, commanded my own flight of angels, my own battalion, I served under him with Benjamin.
>
> Dean: And you think he knows what's going on?
>
> Cass: We'll find out. <u>You wait here.</u>

> Dean: Well, who wants some pie?
>
> Ishim: You know, when I knew Castiel, he was a soldier. He was a warrior. <u>He was an angel's angel.</u> Now look how far he's fallen.
>
> Ishim pours two more packets of sugar into his coffee.
>
> Dean: <u>How about a little coffee with that sugar?</u>
>
> Ishim and Dean stare at each other then Ishim looks at Castiel.
>
> Ishim: No wings, no home. Just a ratty old coat and a pair of poorly trained monkeys.
>
> Dean: <u>Oh. Well, you can go to Hell.</u>
>
> Cass: Dean, it's fine.
>
> Sam: <u>No. No, it's not.</u>
>
> Cass: Sam, this isn't about me. It's about Benjamin.
>
> Ishim: Now that is refreshingly accurate. But since you brought a couple of extra "people" to our little chitchat, we should go somewhere more private. I have a safe house nearby.
>
> Ishim stands.
>
> Ishim: I'll go get Mirabel. (bills rustling) So nice to see you, old friend. Have some pie.

> Ishim throws some money on the table before walking out.

> Cass: Uh, four dead angels indicate that perhaps she is not reasonable. If she has this dark power, it will take all of us to fight her. And I need to heal your wound.

> Ishim: The way you let those simians talk to you... Castiel, when did you get so gooey? You know why we're meant to stay away from them humans? Hmm? It's not because we're a danger to them. <u>They're a danger to us.</u> Case in point.

> <u>Dean hands Cass a beer.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>You earned it.</u>
>
> Cass: Well, this will do very little for me, but I-I appreciate the gesture.
>
> Dean: <u>What Ishim said... You're not weak, Cass. You know that, right?</u>
>
> Sam: I mean, obviously, you've changed, but it's all been for the better, man.
>
> Dean: <u>And you have been with us every step of this long, crazy thrill ride. And no matter how crazy it got, you never backed down.</u>
>
> Sam: <u>And that takes real strength.</u>
>
> Cass: Thank you.
>
> Dean: <u>Cass, I don't like how the whole Billie thing went down. Okay? I know you think you were doing the right thing. And I'm not mad. I'm worried. Because things like "cosmic consequences" have a habit of biting us in the ass.</u>
>
> Cass: I know they do. <u>But I don't regret what I did, even if it costs me my life.</u>
>
> Sam: Don't say that, man.
>
> Dean: So what are you gonna do if you find Kelly and, uh, Lucifer Junior? It is a Nephilim, right?
>
> Cass: Oh, no. It's more than that. An ordinary Nephilim is one of the most dangerous beings in all of creation. But one that's fathered by an archangel, the Devil himself? I...I can't imagine the power.
>
> Sam: But, Cass, at the end of the day, it's a mom and her kid. I mean, do you -- do you think you'll be able to...
>
> Cass: There was a time when I wouldn't have hesitated. But now, I don't know.
>
> Dean: What are we gonna do?
>
> Cass: <u>Let's drink, and hope we can find a better way.</u>
