Somehow this scene just loop in my brain, I can't get it out unless I see a gif made for it. Hear me out.

Remember that time Dick tells Charlie (probably not exact words): "You have ***sparks***. We can replace other ordinary people but people like you are irreplacible." Leviathan might be able to have all the same knowledge and memory but never that ***spark***.

And my brain's keep seeing this scene with "AI" on Dick's head, and "creative writer/artist" on Charlie's head.

All the dataset AI's eating are the people Leviathans devoured, with their memory and knowledge and invention and creation. But however many they eat, they don't have that ***spark***. And that's what only real human creator can do. That's why we can distinguish them so easily, more so for stories than arts (not really *easy* easy, like even Dean and them have trouble telling Leviathan from human, but we *know* how to tell if they have ***sparks***).

Feel like very apt for current AI situation out there in the world that so many people seem to like, but not us. We are Charlie.

We are the remaining survivors that Leviathans (AIs) are still trying to eat but we're fighting back. They are everywhere and taking over the world. And we're trying so hard to save the world.

Who says we're not living in spn world and doing exactly what the Winchesters and Charlie and Cas are trying to do to save it. The world-saving is always hard, but at least we are still on it.

Pat on our shoulders. We are the protagonists and heroes in this story. We might not be big in numbers in this fight, but we are not alone.
