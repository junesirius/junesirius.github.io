> *[TRANSCRIPT]*
>
> *INT. MEN OF LETTERS BUNKER – BASEMENT*
>
>
> Dean and Castiel re-enter the bunker through the library door and slam it shut behind them, returning it to sold brick.
>
> Dean: Come on.
>
> They keep running, upstairs to the main floor of the bunker, and the map room. Dean wanders the room.
>
> Dean: Come on, Dean. Think. Think!
>
> Castiel: Dean, where are you going?!
>
> Dean: I... I don't know!
>
> Castiel: You know she can find us anywhere.
>
> Dean: I know, I know that! I just... What do we do, Ca-
>
> Dean is interrupted by a sudden shock of pain as Billie arrives on the balcony behind him. He drops to the floor, clutching his chest, crying out in pain. Castiel, shocked, sees the culprit above them.
>
> Castiel: Billie.
>
> <u>He grabs Dean by the shoulders to guide him away.</u> On the balcony, Billie has her necrotic, injured hand outstretched, squeezing.
>
> Dean: My heart... I can feel her.
>
> Castiel: <u>Come on, Dean. We gotta go. Come on.</u>
>
> <u>Castiel pulls Dean away, almost carrying him through the bunker as Dean gasps and grunts in pain.</u> At the bottom of the stairs now, Billie follows them slowly, her hand still upturned and squeezing.
>
> Billie: It's you, Dean. It's always been you. Death-defying. Rule-breaking. You are everything I lived to set right. To put down. To tame.
>
> Dean collapses beside the bookshelves just out of view, gripping his chest. Castiel looks over his shoulder where Billie still approaches.
>
> Billie: You are human disorder incarnate.
>
> Billie arrives at the bookshelves, but Dean and Castiel are nowhere in sight. She continues to follow slowly behind where they must've gone, back downstairs. <u>In the downstairs hallway, Castiel's supporting Dean's weight with Dean's arm over his shoulders as he hurries him through the bunker, away from Billie.</u> Dean clutches his heart, groaning in pain.
>
> Castiel: <u>I've got you.</u>
>
> They round another hallway corner, but not far behind them is Billie, still holding her scythe.
>
> Billie: Come on, Dean. You can't escape me.
>
> Billie drags the blade of her scythe against the tile wall. Castiel and Dean hurry on as they hear the metal grinding.
>
> Billie: Don't you think it's finally time? Time for the sweet release of death?
>
> Around another corner, Castiel guides Dean into basement storage room 7B and closes the door behind them. Dean coughs, still holding his chest as he doubles over. Castiel finds a pocket knife in Dean's back pants pocket and uses it to cut his own palm. He uses the blood to paint warding onto the door. Billie approaches the door. The warding glows as it completes. Dean inhales, leaning back in relief as the pain subsides. Castiel turns towards him.
>
> Castiel: Did it work?
>
> Dean swallows hard and nods. Billie places her injured hand just in front of the door, sensing the warding.
>
> Castiel: It blocked her grip on you.
>
> Billie pounds her fist against the door. It shudders. The warding crackles, but holds. The slow pounding continues periodically throughout Castiel and Dean's conversation.
>
> Castiel: Dean, she said that wound was killing her. Maybe we can wait her out.
>
> Dean: Yeah, and if we can't?
>
> Castiel: Then we fight.
>
> Dean: We'll lose. (walking slowly towards the back wall of the room, hopeless) I just led us into another trap, all because I couldn't hurt Chuck. Because I was angry and because I just needed something to kill, and because that's all I know how to do.
>
> Castiel: <u>Dean... (approaches him)</u>
>
> Dean: It was Chuck all along. We shouldn't have left Sam and Jack. We should be there with them right now. <u>(tearfully) Everybody's gonna die, Cass. Everybody. I can't stop it. (approaches Cass) She's gonna get through that door.</u>
>
> Castiel: (quietly) I know.
>
> Dean: <u>And she's gonna kill you, and then she's gonna kill me.</u>
>
> Castiel and Dean exchange a look. Castiel agrees, this situation is hopeless, but he can't bring himself to say it.
>
> Dean: I'm sorry.
>
> Castiel: <u>(realizing) Wait, there is... There's one thing she's afraid of. There's one thing strong enough to stop her. When Jack was dying, I made a deal to save him.</u>
>
> Dean: You what?
>
> Castiel: <u>The price was my life. When I experienced a moment of true happiness, The Empty would be summoned, and it would take me forever.</u>
>
> Dean: Why are you telling me this now?
>
> Castiel: <u>(tearfully) I always wondered, ever since I took that burden, that curse, I wondered what it could be? What my true happiness could even look like. I never found an answer because the one thing I want... It's something I know I can't have. But I think I know... I think I know now. Happiness isn't in the having, it's in just being. It's in just saying it.</u>
>
> Dean: What are you talking about, man?
>
> Castiel: I know. I know how you see yourself, Dean. You see yourself the same way our enemies see you. You're destructive, and you're angry, and you're broken. You're "daddy's blunt instrument." And you think that hate and anger, that's... That's what drives you, that's who you are. It's not. And everyone who knows you see it. Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for love. You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world *for love*. That is who you are. You're the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless, *loving* human being I will ever know. <u>(he smiles, crying now) You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell... Knowing you has changed me. Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam, I cared about Jack... I cared about the whole world because of *you*. (sad laugh as a tear rolls down his cheek) You changed me, Dean.</u>
>
> Dean: (quiet, resigned) Why does this sound like a goodbye?
>
> Castiel: Because it is.
>
> Dean inhales, ready to argue, but Castiel confesses before he can.
>
> Castiel: <u>I love you. (he smiles)</u>
>
> Dean: Don't do this, Cass.
>
> There's a wet noise from behind Dean and he turns to see black goo from The Empty squeezing through the bricks in the bunker's wall as a portal begins to open. <u>They both know what this means. There are tears in Dean's eyes as he turns back to Castiel. Castiel is still smiling tearfully. The warded door busts open. Billie stands behind it with her scythe. There's no more time.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Cass...</u>
>
> Castiel puts his hand, bloodied from when he'd cut it for the warding, on Dean's shoulder.
>
> Castiel: Goodbye, Dean.
>
> Dean: What?
>
> Castiel shoves Dean aside. He hits the floor beneath the portal. A handprint of Castiel's blood remains on the shoulder of his jacket. Billie enters the room. <u>Castiel looks at Dean one last time, smiling, and inhales as the black liquid tendrils of The Empty wrap around him.</u> The Empty crashes against Billie, pulling her in along with them. <u>Dean watches in shock as the portal to The Empty closes, and he's left alone, panting, stunned.</u>
>
> Cut to Dean, who is <u>still alone in the basement of the bunker, still sitting against the wall where Castiel had pushed him.</u> He holds his cellphone in his hand. As it vibrates, ringing again, he looks at it. "Incoming Call: Sam" He stares at it, then looks around, tears in his eyes. He drops the phone, leaving it to ring on the stone ground as he buries his face in his hands and begins to cry.

> *[SHOOTING SCRIPT]*
>
> *INT. MEN OF LETTERS - STORAGE ROOM - DAY*
>
> The quiet of the bunker. Then-- the quiet is broken, as Dean and Cass spill out the door to Death's library. In desperate retreat from Billie.
>
> Dean: Come on.
>
> Dean and Cass hustle out...
>
> *INT. MEN OF LETTERS - LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER*
>
> Dean and Cass keep moving, retreating from Death--
>
> Castiel: Dean, where are we going--
>
> Dean: I don't know--
>
> Castiel: She can find us anywhere--
>
> Dean: I know-- I just--
>
> Dean's spun out. Doesn't know where to go, what the plan is. And then-- he MOANS. In *sudden agony*. He clutches his heart, nearly brought to his knees.
>
> On Castiel-- worried, we BEGIN AN INTERCUT WITH...
>
> *INT. MEN OF LETTERS - CROW'S NEST - INTERCUT*
>
> Billie stands. Her palms cut, festering from her fresh wound. She grips her scythe tight, knuckles flexing on the handle-- SQUEEZING. She's furious, imposing. As menacing as we've ever seen her.
>
> Billie: It's you, Dean. It's always been you.
>
> She SQUEEZES again--
>
> BACK ON DEAN, in the library-- in agony.
>
> Castiel: <u>Dean--</u>
>
> Dean: My heart-- I can feel her...
>
> He MOANS again-- in torment.
>
> BACK ON BILLE. Her hatred of Dean burning in her like a revelation.
>
> Billie: Death-defying, rule-breaking-- you are everything I lived to set right. To put down. To tame.
>
> <u>BACK ON CASTIEL... powerless to protect Dean, as he's brought to the edge of death. His heart's being crushed by Death.</u>
>
> And Cass hears Billie, getting closer-- Dean immobilized by pain. <u>Desperate, Cass hoists Dean's arm over his shoulder, starts dragging him away, pulling him around a corner--</u>
>
> BACK ON BILLIE, entering the library--
>
> Billie: You are human disorder-- *incarnate*.
>
> Billie arrives at where they were.. but they're gone. Her eyes track their escape, as she rounds the corner... to an OPEN DOOR. She follows their path.
>
> *INT. MEN OF LETTERS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS*
>
> <u>Cass struggles, dragging a moaning Dean down the hallway... as they round a corner, out of sight...</u>
>
> Death emerges at the end of the hallway. Hot on their tail. As she drops the scythe with a heavy CLANG, she resumes her slow, relentless pursuit--
>
> Billie: Come on, Dean. You can't escape me.
>
> As she does, she drags her scythe-- it rasps and scrapes along the floor-- terrifying. Utterly confident that she will kill Dean.
>
> Billie: Don't you think it's finally time? Time for the sweet release... of *Death*?
>
> Off Billie, implacable, menacing--
>
> *INT. MEN OF LETTERS - DUNGEON - CONTINUOUS*
>
> Cass maneuvers Dean inside-- as he releases Dean, he races to the door... cutting his palm, hastily slapping a BLOOD SIGIL on the door, activating it--
>
> BANG! Just as Billie arrives at the door. Stymied, for now.
>
> On Dean-- taking a deep breath-- rubbing his chest--
>
> Castiel: It worked. (then) It blocked her grip on you.
>
> Dean just barely nods-- still reeling, out of breath.
>
> Castiel: <u>She can't get us in here. You're safe.</u>
>
> On Dean. Recovering physically-- but still spun. <u>Something BREAKING in Dean. How did he end up here? How could everything have gone so horribly wrong?</u>
>
> <u>Cass sees this-- Dean's devastation. His uncertainty.</u>
>
> Castiel: She said that wound was killing her. We can wait her out.
>
> Dean: And if we can't?
>
> Castiel: We'll fight.
>
> On Dean. With eerie, sudden certainty--
>
> Dean: *We'll lose*. (then) I just-- I walked us into another trap. All because I couldn't hurt Chuck, 'cause I was angry-- 'cause I needed something to kill. (then) *Cause that's all I know how to do*.
>
> Castiel: <u>Dean--</u>
>
> Dean: It was Chuck all along. We should've stayed with Sam and Jack. We should be there, with them.
>
> They're both distraught. Everyone they care about is in danger.
>
> Dean: Everyone's going to die, Cass. And I-- *I can't stop it*.
>
> <u>Cass's heart breaks to see Dean so broken.</u> But just then-- BOOM! Billie's POUNDING at the door. Dean and Cass turn to the door. *Billie's outside, banging to get in.*
>
> She POUNDS again-- Cass looks around-- with each BOOM, the warding SPARKS... like it'll all come down, at any moment. <u>On Castiel, devastated-- he turns to Dean. Sees his resignation, his guilt and shame.</u>
>
> Dean: She's gonna get through that door. And she's gonna kill you-- then she's gonna kill me.
>
> BOOM. BOOM. <u>And as the light sparks again, illuminating Dean's face-- something occurs to Cass. The spark of an idea. He looks down at his bloody palm, then back at Dean.</u>
>
> <u>And we see Cass's POV of Dean again-- his face drawn, drained of hope. But still beautiful. Still Dean Winchester.</u>
>
> Castiel: There's something. One thing-- strong enough to stop her.
>
> Dean glances skeptically at Cass-- then stops. He sees: Cass is dead serious. BOOM. <u>Cass, coming clean--</u>
>
> Castiel: When Jack died-- I made a deal. A deal to save him.
>
> Dean: You what?
>
> Castiel: The price was my life. When I experienced a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be *summoned*. It would come for me, and take me into itself... forever.
>
> BOOM. Cass keeps going.
>
> Dean: Why-- why are you telling me this now--
>
> <u>Cass is pacing, processing-- working out *an epiphany*.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Since I took that burden, that curse-- I've always wondered what it could be-- what my true happiness would even look like. (smiling) I never found an answer. Because the one thing I want-- it's something *I know I can't have*.</u>
>
> <u>On Dean, arrested by this strange confession. Cass looks up-- eyes filling with tears. And the *beginning of joy*.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>But I think I know now. Happiness isn't in the having. It's in-- just being. Just-- *saying it*.</u>
>
> <u>And he fixes Dean with his stare.</u> BOOM.
>
> Dean: Saying *what*, Cass?
>
> Castiel: I know how you see yourself, Dean. The same way our enemies see you. You're destructive, angry-- broken. "Daddy's Blunt Instrument."
>
> <u>Dean senses Cass's urgency-- but he has no idea where Cass's words will lead.</u>
>
> Castiel: You think hate and anger-- that that's what drives you. You think that's who you are. (then) But it's not. And everyone who knows you can see it.
>
> Dean: <u>Cass?</u>
>
> BOOM. Cass, undisturbed, keeps going.
>
> Castiel: <u>Everything you've ever done-- the good and the bad-- you've done it for love. You raised your brother-- for love. You've fought for this world-- for love. (then) *That's* who you are. (then) You're the best and most caring man on Earth. The most selfless and loving human being I've ever known.</u>
>
> BOOM.
>
> Castiel: <u>Ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell... knowing you has changed me. Because you cared-- I cared. (then) About you. About Sam, and Jack-- and the world. You did that Dean... you changed me.</u>
>
> <u>Dean is emotional. Cass's words have hit him deeply--- striking right at the core of his self-doubt.</u> But--
>
> Dean: Cass. What does this have to do with-- <u>(then, emotional) Why does this sound like goodbye?</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>(beaming) Because it is.</u>
>
> <u>On Cass-- almost beatific. Eyes open, heart full-- somehow *happier than we've ever seen him*.</u> BOOM! The warding fritzing, SPARKLING-- about to come down. Cass pays it no mind.
>
> <u>Dean is stunned, confused. Cass is lit up, ready to speak his deepest truth.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>*I love you.*</u>
>
> <u>On Dean, shocked-- receiving this declaration from his best friend. On Castiel, filled with joy. Dean can't reciprocate, but Cass doesn't need him to. Saving Dean, sacrificing himself, speaking his truth-- Cass is at peace.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Cass--</u>
>
> The moment is cut short. As--
>
> BOOM! A DARK RIFT forms in the room. Leaking black ooze. Like the one we saw when Nick tried to summon Lucifer from the EMPTY last season--
>
> And at the same time--
>
> BOOM! The door FLIES OPEN, and Billie busts into the room-- scythe in hand-- a menacing silhouette... ready to kill them both.
>
> As she regards Cass and Dean-- and the DARK RIFT.
>
> <u>Cass pulls Dean close--</u>
>
> Castiel: Goodbye, Dean.
>
> Then, he SHOVES Dean aside as--
>
> FOOM! BLACK GOO erupts from the rift (like the goo that attacked Heaven last season)--
>
> Consuming Cass and Billie.
>
> Like a TIDAL WAVE. And then--
>
> We're ON Dean. As he recovers...
>
> <u>CASS. BILLIE. The goo. The rift. They're ALL GONE.</u>
>
> <u>Dean's all alone.</u>
>
> And off that <u>heartbreaking</u> image, we...
>
> BLACKOUT.
>
> *INT. MEN OF LETTERS - DUNGEON - DAY*
>
> <u>Dean's phone rings. But Dean doesn't answer. He's in the corner, back to the wall. His best friend dead-- only a bloody handprint on Dean's clothes remains. Shattered, hopeless, ALONE. And off that desolate image, we--</u>
>
> BLACKOUT.
