## Draft

丁后悔，疯狂努力要救回卡

Jack：我知道他只有在真正快乐的时候才会被虚无带走，我很高兴至少在他走之前你给了他他最想要的。你亲吻他了吗？

丁（震惊）：什么？

米：告诉我你至少给了他拥抱。

丁：（更震惊难过，taken back，speechless说不出话）

Jack/米：（也震惊）所以你什么都没有给他？那他怎么……？

丁：（痛苦后悔）

丁在1520死之前一直在想卡的时候，念念不忘，然后像1520一样死了，但是死之后上不了天堂，灵魂变成鬼魂，因为有unfinished business，卡就是他的unfinished business。为了让丁灵魂解放，米召唤Jack/new God（或者这个很早就试过了），但是Jack也做不到，虚无独立于上帝力量之外。丁无望地痛苦，感觉内心有缺失空洞，空洞越来越大，然后因为内心的空洞就是一种empty，所以他的灵魂也进入Empty了（文字游戏）。在虚无里见到卡，唤醒卡（可能卡本来就没睡），回应卡的感情，于是虚无不再虚无，内心被填满，用情感充满了虚无，于是让他们俩不再虚无，虚无也就对他们没有掌控能力了，所以他们得以一起逃脱虚无（简单俗气地说就是用爱打败了反派）。回来以后卡重新变成天使，丁灵魂上天堂，俩人在天堂重逢继续快乐生活。（卡也许也会提议让丁再次复活，但是丁可能拒绝了，地球反正还会有卡和米保护的，他想要休息了，he earned it）

1323丁想要的退休海边生活他说过这是他earn的但是从来没得到过，也许可以作为这里的结局

### Edit notes

(overall) restrain "think" V.O., more descriptive scenes, "show it, don't tell it", less adj., more n./v.

~~(overall) change some of the "Empty" to "Shadow"~~

~~(pace) after Dean goes into the Empty, the pace is a little rushed, need reread to follow -> make what happened clearer~~

~~(plot) after they reunite, could make it more emotional, more than hug, maybe a little first kiss (pending), some soul-grace entanglement maybe, make it more intense to balance out the angst~~

### Summary

Where does one go, when there is nothing left in them to be taken, when the hole in the heart is so vast that there is no heart remains, when the surrounding and the whole world matter nothing and have no difference to pure dark and black, indistinguishable from the void, when themselves *are* empty. Where do they go?

## Main

### Act 0

> (canon) Cas dies to save Dean, the confession, the devastation, the pain, the lost. Dean has to tell Jack, Jack asks what makes Cas truly happy, Dean realizes he gives Cas nothing.

*NO.*

*No, no, no, no, this is not happening.*

Dean feels his body moving forward, reaching out. Lips trembling.

*Cas.*

He cries out his name, matching his gaze. His throat is not working. But he's shouting the angel's name. *Cas, Cas --*

But Castiel does not hear him. His shouts are buried inside. Dean watches the teary smile, pinned frozen by the pained happiness in his eyes. The most hopeless, devastated happiness he's ever seen. And yet, it's happiness that he can see. It's Cas's happiness that he's witnessing, for the first time. And the last.

"Don't do this, Cas." his lips move. He pleads. His heart pounds as hard as Billie's fists against the door. The countdown to their deaths. Their separation. For eternity.

*Don't.*

His eyes are burning hot. He can't cry. Not now. Not when tears will blur his vision of the angel. Of Cas. Of Cas when he said he --

Dean breathes hard.

*Don't do this, Cas... Don't say goodbye. Don't leave me.*

Dean's mind is saying, screaming, he doesn't know if his lips follow. He can't breathe. His stomach twists the entire internal upside down, stirs into scramble, churning.

*Don't go, Cas. Don't die... Please.*

And then, all is over. Like a dream. A bad dream waking up. Or a good one interrupted.

There is just silence. Dead, empty, hopeless silence all over him. All around him.

No Cas.

No Cas anymore.

Forever. He said. Gone.

He just lost him. Again.

Dean's eyes burn boiling hot. He can't hold back anymore.

For the first time in a long time, he cries. It all happened so fast. Too fast then, too slow now. And too many times. Every second stretches -- seconds to minutes, minutes to hours, hours to eternity. Cas's last words echo in his mind, looping over and over.

He should have said something back. Why is there always so little time. Why does it always have to be goodbye.

The world is ending, outside. Dean buries his face between his knees, staring at the vibrating phone with Sam's name on it, realizing, distantly. But his world just ended. Already. Right in front of him. In a big pile of black ether.

<br>

Dean doesn't know how he managed to get out of the bunker, into the car, onto the road. The body did all the motions. He's not there. Not really.

There is no one on the road. He doesn't even notice at first -- not until he's on the road for far too long. The world is horribly wrong, but somehow the quiet, the emptiness, the silence outside the window feels right. It might feel worse if the Earth continued spinning and there were people still talking, laughing, living --

When Cas is gone.

Sam and Jack are waiting for him. The duty of saving the world still waits for him.

Dean drags himself out of the car. Feeling way too tired to focus on what comes next. *Why does it always have to be them?* But in the end, Cas sacrificed for him so he could do his job, Cas *loved* him for being good at it, for caring, for saving, for doing what he does, didn't he?

Dean walks toward them.

Everyone's eyes are full of grief. Everyone for a different reason.

Dean doesn't know if he can say anything, about what happened, or do anything, next. He feels the head dizzy, too heavy, dragging his body down. His whole body feels sick. Numb and sluggish. Shutting down.

*This can't be happening. Cas, the world, any of it.* Worse than the worst nightmare he's ever had. Is it still not the time to snap out of the bad dream?

"Where is Cas?" Two steps away from them, Jack is the first to ask. Sam looks at him with the same question in his eyes.

Another mountainous wave of sickness crashes over him. There is no word, more than sorrow, more than grief. What's the word for this ocean of pressure on his chest like water flushing him up and down, engulfing him, dragging him under the surface? He's breathless. Drowning.

*Lost.*

This is the word. *Lost.*

He can't look Jack in the eyes. How do you tell a son that his father is gone? Gone for him. *Because* of him.

But he has to say it. Sooner or later.

Dean swallows hard. There are blades in his throat. Every swallow, every syllable, the words are cutting him anew. Bleeding never stops. Wounds that will never heal again.

They already know the answer. Just by looking at him. The mess he is. But he has to say it. *Cas is... Cas...* He chokes at the thought. *Cas is gone.*

Dean forces the words out, one word at a time. Eventually. "Cas saved me."

He tells them about the deal -- the deal he only learned about moments before Cas was taken, the deal Jack had known all along but never said a word about.

He tells them all that he knows, except for the truth.

The truth of what Cas's true happiness was.

But none of them are fools.

Jack has sparkling tears in his eyes too. Dean only now realizes so belatedly just how close they must have been -- father and son. The bond he never really looked close enough.

But Jack smiles, looking into Dean's eyes. "But I'm glad," the kid says. "At least before he was gone, you gave him what made him truly happy. What he always wanted. Did you kiss him?"

Dean can't breathe. "What?"

Jack blinks, somehow surprised. "Please tell me you at least hugged him?"

Dean stares, speechless.

The kid -- barely three years old and practically knows nothing about how human emotions work, yet somehow able to sense so acutely -- widens his eyes. "You didn't give him *anything*? Then how... how did Cas find his true happiness?"

How indeed.

His stomach roils and lurches. Dean turns around, can't bear their eyes for one more second. Can't bear the thoughts crawling inside his own head one more second.

*Cas doesn't deserve this. He doesn't deserve Cas's...*

He didn't give him *anything*. He didn't even...

Dean forces his stare to stay on something in the distance, on the skyline, staring so long without blinking that tears fall down from the corner of his eyes again.

The world is mourning with him. The empty silence in the universe. The vacuum in existence, the tear in reality, the hole in the heart.

There is no bird singing, no dog barking, no human talking. No sound, no laughter, no life, because --

Cas is gone. So nothing is whole again. Nothing will ever be. Or it is just how Dean sees it -- would see it, even if it's not the reality.

<br>

### Act 1

> **Outline:** So after Cas is taken by the Empty, Dean gets so devastated that he spends most of his remaining time trying to access Empty and save Cas back but can't -- he thinks he can't but actually his yearning already reaches the Empty and wakes Cas up, except Cas can't come back to him, only can see him from beyond.

And then, there is the end of it. Just like all the finish lines of every other world-ending events, the good wins the evil, the "happy" ending where people celebrate. Chuck gets taken out, and Jack becomes the new God. So everything is settled.

Except, there is no celebration. Only mourning. Only a funeral.

They don't even have a body to burn.

Dean brings a trench coat that looks exactly the same as Cas's old one to the pyre. The pyre he insists on chopping and stacking all by himself.

Something about a ceremonial memorial.

Jack comes. Standing besides Sam and Dean. A deja vu of three years ago.

And the kid -- the new God -- apparently remembers what Sam taught him last time.

He says thank you, then says sorry, and at last, says goodbye.

Dean can't say anything. Eyes red, bloody and glassy, looking straight into the burning flames, watching scraps of fabric catch the wind and fly in the air.

He remembers standing right here watching Cas's body burn like this, three years ago. Watching the body wrapped by the white curtain turn to char, believing that was the end of Cas. The pain had nearly destroyed him back then. He doesn't know how he survived that -- or maybe he wouldn't have, if Cas hadn't come back. But he did, Cas came back. So maybe, just maybe, this time, luck can be on their side again? With a miracle and the new God on their side?

Dean's knees give way. Jack is startled. "Dean!"

Dean can't care about whether it's appropriate -- not to a boy who is like his son, not to a new and high celestial authority like the others he never knelt before. He can't think about any of that, he can only think of one thing -- one person.

"You have to bring him back." Dean chokes out, teary, looking up at the kid from low, pleading in a way he never has to anyone, for anyone, at any time. "You're the God now, Jack. I'll only ask you for this one thing and never trouble you again, but you *have* to bring Cas back."

"Dean--" Jack holds his arms and helps him up. His eyes are as clean and innocent as they used to be, as deep and sad just as Cas looked like, near the end. This is a miracle in itself that Jack even looks like Cas. But what he says is a blow to Dean's head.

Jack says, "I can't, Dean. I'm sorry. I tried, but it didn't work."

*But he did it last time, even before he knew what he could do, didn't he? He must be able to do it again.* Dean thinks, hard, arguing, and tells him so.

"God has no power in the Empty," Jack tells him, factually. "Not even I know how my pray reached Cas and woke him up last time. Maybe it's just because I wanted him back really, really bad."

*But I want him back just as bad. More. It has to be more.* Dean thinks, this time he doesn't say it out loud.

"Okay." He says, instead. "Guess I'll just keep praying."

<br>

And he does. Just like he said.

Dean prays every day and night. He prays to Cas every time he thinks of him, every time something reminds him of the angel. He prays in silence, in whispers, and in words.

He pours a cup of coffee from the bunker's coffee machine, and thinks, "Cas, didn't you use to order coffee from the Biggerson's?" He contemplates at the steaming hot bitter liquid. "Want to come by and try this one? Bet homemade is better than those premade ones."

He turns on the TV, flipping through a few channels until he stops at a nature channel, watching the creatures with the most bewildering names roaming and chasing, hunting and mating. Dean scoots over on the couch even without himself realizing, leaving half the space vacant as if someone is just going to walk straight into the room, sit next to him, share his popcorn and enjoy the show.

"You'd like this, wouldn't you, Cas?" he talks to the bowl of popcorn, then at the screen. Some creature on the screen chirps back at him in response. "Never could get you into westerns, but you know what? Nature works for me. You hear me? So better move your ass down here and don't keep me waiting."

The other side of the sofa stays cold.

<br>

Sam tries to talk to him once or twice. Or three times. But Dean brushes him off.

"You're praying to him again, aren't you?" Sam catches him staring at a plate of bacon with far too much attention one morning. "It won't work. And you know that. The denial, the pretense, all those stages. Dean, as much as I feel you, you have to move on. It's not healthy. Excuse me for saying this, but you were exactly like this when Dad was gone, and then when Mom was gone. Now with Cas... It's like it's getting even worse. Man, you need to buck up. I'm sorry, but he's gone, and he's not coming back this time."

Dean doesn't need to look at him to know the pitifulness in his brother's drooping puppy eyes. Sam doesn't know what he knows, how can he feel what he feels? Dean continues fiddling with his bacon with a fork, eyes focused on it but not looking.

"You never know," Dean throws a glance at Sam's general direction, not meeting his eyes. "Cas came back from the Empty before, maybe he just needs a little help to come back again. Hell, Nick woke *Lucifer* up from the Empty just by *thinking* about him strong enough, because that sicko thought he *wanted* the Devil back. Maybe we just haven't *wanted* strong enough? So quit talking me out of it, you should join me praying and thinking and *wanting*, we might bring Cas home faster."

Sam sighs. He might have said something about that was when Chuck was still around, maybe rules worked differently back then, maybe that mechanism expired with Chuck gone. Because... because certainly anyone with eyes can see if Dean's *want* is not strong enough, then no one's would ever be. Dean stops listening.

Sam leaves the kitchen without another word.

Dean just keeps doing what he's determined to do. Thinking, praying, wanting, yearning -- whatever you call it, whatever the universe or the Empty can work with -- he's taking Cas home. Even if it's the last thing he'd ever do for the rest of his life.

<br>

The fact is, the emotions *do* get transmitted into the Empty like a laser beam, shining brightly into the corner where the sleeping angel lies.

"Cas." Dean's voice knocks at his temple.

"Cas. We need you. *I* need you." Cas stirs in his eternal sleep, his body -- the body that is materializing slowly in the Empty -- twitches.

"Cas, please--" Dean is definitely crying. The muffled sound, the wet choking sniff, the pained desperate gasp, pierces through Castiel's sleeping ears, reaching deep down, tugging.

The angel opens his eyes, looking into the pure blackness before him.

*The Empty.* Castiel recognizes this place instantly. Arriving and fumbling around for the third round does make one get familiar with a place, want or not.

Cas stands up -- he can't see or feel his body, or the ground, or the air, the Empty is truly *empty*, but he thinks about the motion anyway, trying to anchor himself somewhere, instead of flowing in the pure void nothingness.

He anchors himself to the voice reaching him consistently -- Dean's voice.

Dean's voice that is calling his name, begging and pleading, among other things he's telling him, the random small daily human life things, the coffee, the popcorn, the bacon -- all the things that are on the Earth, with color and shape and texture and taste, all the things that are real enough and certainly *not empty*. He anchors his entire existence on it.

Cas thinks he can see his own body now -- finally solidified. The small amount of space closest to him lit up by some lumination radiating from something inside his chest.

He chooses a direction, and starts walking.

<br>

"Aren't you that annoying little bug, buzzing in my head again?" Not very surprised this time, the shadowy "friendly neighborhood cosmic entity" that is the personalization of the Empty takes shape several steps behind him -- the shape of himself.

Cas turns to it, looking at the Shadow that is so alike to his own reflection but also nothing close.

"Yes," he says, squinting, silently challenging, betting his chance. "It's me again. And I'm awake again."

The Shadow makes a truly annoyed sound. Cas wonders if the same trick and bargain could work twice.

"I know what you're thinking," it gloats. "Don't think for a second I'll let you go back again."

"Why not?" Cas straightens, head held high. He has to go back, one way or another -- he can't keep Dean waiting. He certainly can't let Dean sound like that broken for one more minute.

*How long has he been asleep?* Cas wonders. *How long has he made Dean so sad? Did they manage to win the ultimate fight and get their peace and freedom?* There are still so many things he wants to know, so many words to say. Even if nothing else, he wants so bad to just *be* there, by his side. In the end, it's all about just *being*, as he realized, isn't it? But he needs to *be*.

"Because," the cosmic entity says, tone mocking. "You would just keep popping in, and I have to keep popping you out. What am I, an amusement park ticket seller? This is just another theme park to you, you annoying undead creature?"

Castiel thinks hard. "I'll be careful this time," he says solemnly. "Won't disturb you for another eon, I promise."

The Shadow scoffs. "That's not the deal we made, remember? The deal was, you summon me, and I *own* you. Permanently. Period. No new deal, no nothing. Did you forget, everything comes to the Empty, stays in the Empty? Shouldn't have let you out the first time."

*So no deal then.* Cas thinks bitterly. What are his chances of scraping for something else?

"Okay, I stay here," he speaks as he considers, "but I assure you I won't go back to sleep. So what do you have in plan for the eternity to spend with me?"

Castiel aims for a smirking smile, thinking it's what Dean would say. "I hope you have a big enough stock of board games and DVD collections. I finished binging *Game of Thrones*, by the way."

The Shadow roars. Black hollow ether spraying and splashing like dirty water in waste pipes.

"What about I torture you for eternity, while you watch what you can never go back to, until you give up what you're holding on to and finally go back to sleep like a good boy should?"

At that, the view overhead opens up. For a split of second, Cas thinks he might be having hallucinations -- that he is flying among the clouds again like he used to, long ago, taking an upside-down swirl, looking down at the Winchesters' house from high above. The view clears. Through the ceiling of the bunker, he sees the brothers. Walking, talking, occasionally throwing some cold jokes at each other, but the smiles barely reach eyes for either of them.

He finds Dean, quickly. His eyes scrutinize him. Cas has no sense of time here, but Dean looks so much more worn out than he used to. His body is the same familiar shape as he memorized and built all these years ago, but it has aged, weathered by time that no one has control over. The wrinkled crow's foot, the dark bags under his eyes, the constant furrow between his brows. *How long has he been gone really?* Dean looks tired -- so drained that all strength has been sapped from his limbs, from his whole body. His head is low, fingers loosely clutching a bottle of alcohol, slumping into a chair. Is he crying?

And then, Dean's words reach him again. The familiar sound of this man -- this brilliant, beautiful man -- but so rusty. Cas's mind wanders afar. *Did Dean ever cry?* Cas has never seen him like that before. Is Dean feeling so sad all for him, because of him? The guilt of having to leave him like this crushes his heart.

Dean is saying, "Cas, I -- I probably should give up, like Sam said. But I can't. I just can't. With other people, after some time, maybe I can move on. But not you, Cas. Not you. I don't know why, but --" his voice chokes. "I just can't. Every time I think you might be in the Empty, alone, asleep, surrounded by other dead angels and demons, like in a giant awful graveyard. I -- I can't. No way I'd leave you there."

Dean glances upward. Cas's heart skips a beat, as if for that split moment their gazes might have met. But he realizes the impossibility just as quickly.

Dean continues, "I just hope you can hear me, Cas. With everything we lost, I can't lose you again. Not like this. You have to wake up, you understand? Come back to me. Talk to me. Let me know how I can help bring you back, because --" his voice breaks with a wet sound again, "because there are so many things I want to tell you."

Cas has to tear his eyes away from the view above. The opening in the Empty doesn't look like a real gate, more like a huge projector screen on the ceiling. No way through except to look.

"Is it real?" he asks, dubiously, redundantly. Dean's voice already tells the answer, but he has to ask.

"Very," the tip of the Shadow's lip jerks up. This entity is clearly enjoying itself too much.

"Why? Why show me all this, but not let me go back?"

"Because I want to punish you!" The Shadow scolds. "You're loud, you're annoying, and bad boys get punished. So consider this your eternal punishment. Hey, on the bright side, you get to watch your boyfriend from here for eternity -- oh wait, only until he dies -- while you, I assure you, will find that going back to sleep would simply be a far better option."

At that, the pain starts, in his body and mind. Black ether of emptiness shapes and wraps around him, acting like ropes and whips and knives. Everywhere it touches, the existence does not. Cutting him, piercing him, drilling holes, then reaching through the wounds, reaching deep inside. And when it retreats temporarily, Cas finds himself healed, wounds filled with fresh-grown, newly-materialized bones and flesh -- only to be cut open and drilled and minced, again, and again. Like Prometheus and the Greek eagle, with the repeatedly eaten and regrown liver. Trapped and punished for eternity.

Cas almost laughs. If he gets to be punished like Prometheus, that surely means he finally did something good, right? Saved the humans. Saved Dean.

If the Empty thinks *this* can make him succumb, then it doesn't know him very well.

Cas lets the sensation of pain and agony rest at the periphery of his mind, looking up through the projection at Dean again, smiling.

*If this is the cost to pay, if this is what can keep Dean safe, then it's all worth it.*

"Dean," he murmurs, knowing too well the human couldn't hear him from the Earth, but Cas says it anyway. "Don't worry about me. Just, go live your life. Be yourself. Be happy."

He chews on his own words, considering, then says it again. "I'm already happy enough, Dean. Now it's your turn. You should find your true happiness -- without me."

<br>

### Act 2

> **Outline:** Then Dean dies as 15.20 canon shows in an everyday vampire job, but after the death he can't go to heaven because he has unfinished business (he hasn't saved Cas yet, Cas is his unfinished business) so he becomes a ghost.

"Hey Cas, don't laugh at me, alright? But I might have called your phone way too many times. Remember you still have that ridiculous voicemail message? Yeah, we're so gonna change it when you come back."

"Cas, I know I told Sam I'd turn in early and get some sleep, but... I can't. I keep thinking about the early days when we first met, you know? So many times you'd startle me when I woke up and found you staring at me. Man, it's really creepy to watch people sleep, but uh, I wouldn't mind having that again now."

"Sam dragged me back into hunting again. I didn't want to go, but he insisted. Guess that must be how he felt like when I pulled him out of Stanford. And guess what, it's a ghost, a woman, just like the Woman in White. Sometimes it feels like time and everything is just a whole pile of bad jokes -- nothing's changed in fifteen years except we're getting older. And, uh, we don't have angels on our shoulders now. So Cas, want to pop in and prove me wrong?"

"Hey Cas, man, I know you don't need to sleep, this is probably catching up with all the sleep you've missed in the past already. So rise and shine, time to get up."

"We got ourselves a shapeshifter case today. I hate him so much. He read my mind and... and... and he turned into you. Sammy had to take him down because I couldn't. I'm sorry, Cas. I know he's not you, but... it's been so long. I still can't. I'm sorry... I..."

"Sam doesn't know why we had a birthday cake for dinner today, and I ordered extra champagne -- I drank your share, by the way. It's top-shelf stuff. I just realized, with everything going on, we never get a chance to decide a birthday or anything for you. Not even once. So, if no objection from you, I think I'll take the liberty and declare today your birthday. It's September 18th, Cas. You don't think I'd forget the day we first met, do you? Man, did I ever tell you about that day you walked in? Jesus, you were just... poof... you know. The light, the sound, the wind, it was crazy. It's... it's really awesome, I ever told you that? Sorry, rambling now, probably too much that... umm... I'll get another drink, I'll just --"

"Cas, I think there is no more angel or heaven or Empty-related book I haven't read in the world. Sam helped too, but I read them all, just to be sure. So is all the magic and lore and people with power we can seek help from, but... there is nothing. I can't believe it, there is just nothing on how to bring you back. But I'll keep trying, alright? I swear, if this is the only thing I do before the lights go out, I'll do it right and bring you back."

"Cas -- it would be especially good to have you here today. It's a whole pack of wolves -- so many more than we thought. Sam and I almost didn't make it out, but don't worry, we're fine now. A little hurt, but no big deal. Just... been thinking about what would happen if we check out now. Where would we go, how would that leave you -- I haven't brought you back yet. I have this one job, and I'm gonna finish it."

"Hey Cas, gonna head out to a case today, think it's vamp. Probably just a milk run, some kids missing, the nest isn't even hard to find. I'll tell you how it goes once it's finished, alright?"

<br>

Castiel watches, and listens. He hears them all. His body is in pain, his brain being poked and prodded, tendrils binding and scratching everywhere, but he keeps his eyes on the view the Empty gives him, locking his gaze on Dean and Dean alone.

He can see him, and he can hear him. Cas is already satisfied. This isn't even a too bad eternity, all things considered.

It's like listening to a voicemail in real time. You know the other side is right there, talking, but your hand is just too occupied to pick up the phone.

Castiel responds regardless -- in murmurs, in a choked voice, or in between spitting blood as his insides are twisted and torn. The black ethers reach into him, blending and slicing him like scrambled eggs. He thought the pain would dull over time, but it hasn't. It is still sharp and acute with every touch of the torture.

But he keeps his focus on the view -- on Dean -- strong enough, he can live with it, forgetting the torture most of the time.

Cas answers the prayers as if Dean can hear him. He always answers Dean's prayers -- from heaven, from Earth, from Purgatory. He goes to him if he can, speaks to him when he thinks he can hear, sends someone to check in on him when he has to -- never has he ignored Dean's prayers. Why should the Empty be any different? So hear him or not, Cas says them anyway:

"Be careful, Dean. Ghosts can be tricky too."

"That is a lovely birthday cake, Dean. I like it, but you can take the cherry on top if you want. I'm not going to fight for it. And... I think you probably shouldn't keep drinking."

"You're hurt, Dean! The werewolf wounds, even if not the bite mark, they can get infected. I wish I could be there to heal you."

"Dean, the vampires can be dangerous. Please be careful."

"Dean! Watch out for that metal bar behind you!"

"Dean!!"

*No, no, no--*

Cas's heart almost stops as the events in front of him unfold. He struggles so hard to reach toward the view that he nearly breaks free from the black entity's hold before being dragged back.

Dean is hurt. He is so clearly fatally hurt. A ragged wound on his back, blood streaming down. Each word and each breath push out so difficult.

*I should be there.* Cas can't help but think desperately. *If I were there, I could heal you.* His heart is crunched to pieces. But he's not there.

Dean is fading. And Cas can do nothing. He is too far away -- too dead, for him.

He understands the Empty's torture now. This is his ultimate punishment -- witnessing everything, but can't do anything, the absolute powerless, the inability to save the man he so desperately tried to save. In the end, it is a metal bar that takes him -- piercing through his body in the middle.

Castiel closes his eyes, letting the pain sink in. The physical torture and sensation returns, the wounds, the holes, the tears, they all come back. Is it the same feeling Dean is going through right now? But it's more than that, more than the physical pain. It's the eternal agony of knowing Dean Winchester is dead -- and he can't be there for him. He can't change it this time.

<br>

Dean breathes shallowly, bearing the pain. The metal in his back is probably the only thing holding him together now. Blood is draining fast. He can feel himself fading. His fingers already start to turn cold and feeble. His little brother looks at him in tears.

"It's okay." Dean smiles back at him, easily, exhaling slowly.

"No," Sam says, through wet eyes. "We'll figure something out. I can bring you back."

*Not this time, not anymore.* Dean thinks, determined, and tells him so. Enough of the ride, enough bending of the rule. If this is the day, then this is the day.

"If Cas was here --"

That makes Dean swallow hard. "But he's not." But he's not, he's... in a much worse place than he would go to next. The calm, easy facade shatters. Tears surge, flooding his eyes. This is his finish line, but he hasn't finished everything yet. Always too little time. Always too many things unfinished.

Death is almost an old friend now, during this hell of a ride. Metaphorically and literally. Dean lets his tears fall, and lets his last breath leave the lung. The pain eases, slipping away like stripping an old worn jacket. He walks out of his body, forcing his eyes away from his little brother, who holds the remains of him, wailing on his shoulder.

"Hello, Dean." Death, the original Horseman, greets him, holding on to his exquisite cane, leaning by the other wall. He looks exactly like he did ten years ago when Dean took him down.

Dean -- his soul, or his consciousness, whatever he is now that still holds his image -- takes half a step back, can't help himself.

"I'm sorry," is the first thing that slips from his mouth at the sight of this familiar old figure. The old man looks older than the entire universe.

"I'm sorry for what I did when I had to --" Dean hurries to explain, eyeing Death's expression carefully. He doesn't exactly have pickled chips for him this time as an apology.

"Dean." Death looks at him, expression soft and not unkind. "I'm not here to blame you, or hold an old grudge, if that's what you're worried about."

"You're not?" Dean controls his voice, tight on edge, stepping closer slowly, one hesitant step at a time. "But I killed you."

"About that --" Death tilts his head slightly, looking up for a moment -- the look of a human when they seek out God from above -- before locking his eyes with Dean again.

"You planned everything all along?" Dean realizes, gasping. "To reap God?"

"Told you God could die too, a long time ago, didn't I?" Death gives the faintest hint of a smile, eyes gleaming with approval.

"So what now?" Dean swallows, steeling himself for an answer that he might not like. Glancing upwards, then down, he wonders where Death will lead him -- to Heaven? Hell?

"I told this to your brother the last time we met, and I'm telling this to you now, Dean Winchester," In his iconic solemn tone, Death tells him. "I try very hard not to pass judgment at times like this, but you..." A pause, he regards him, then, "Well played, my boy."

Dean blinks. Approval from Death himself, he has to admit he never saw that coming. He nods in appreciation, flattered.

"Now, whenever you're ready." Death half-turns, leading the way to a door that vaguely can be seen floating in mid-air, glowing with a gentle warm light. Presumably the doorway to the afterlife.

Dean eyes the passage, considering. "Yeah, about that." He hesitates.

Death looks back at him, shooting a questioning look. "What's the matter? Do you want to stay behind?"

"Is there any chance you can help bring Cas back from the Empty?" Dean blurts out, then adds, "Please?"

"I see, unfinished business, is it?" Death muses, looking briefly at the ground before meeting Dean's gaze again. "Unfortunately, I can't. The Empty is.. in a one-way lockdown now, I'm afraid. I'm sorry."

Dean swallows again, nodding, thinking quickly. "One-way, you say? So there is some way in. Can I go there?"

"Unless you're a dead angel or demon, which you're not," It's just the fact they both know and Death points out again.

"Billie threatened us before, saying she'd toss us into the Empty if we die again. Doesn't that mean you can toss me there too?" Dean holds on to the last straw like a drowning man.

"Billie," Death ponders the name. "I can see why she'd say that. Tempting, isn't it? Funny how a threat could turn into a last hope. But that's all it is, a threat."

"So there's no way? Not even after I go to Heaven or Hell?" Dean swallows.

"Not even then. Especially not after Heaven. You will have peace, trouble like this will leave you."

"I'll forget about Cas?"

"In time, yes." Death tells him, flat.

Dean wipes his eyes, breathing out deeply.

"Sam's gonna hate me for this." He mutters, not as nearly a joke as he hoped it would land.

"What are you saying?" Death says, tone warning and slow. "Don't make the mistake."

Dean manages a small smile, his decision made. "Think I'll stay behind for a bit, if that's okay with you. I'll catch up once I get this one thing done."

"Dean," Death presses, his voice growing more intimidating now. "You don't want this. Becoming a ghost isn't what you think it's like. You can't bring the angel back as a living person, why do you think you can achieve that as a ghost?"

Dean gives him a grin. "Well, can't blame a guy for trying. For one, think I'd get more time working on it. But I know for sure I don't want to get to whatever afterlife paradise and forget Cas is still stuck in Superhell."

"Then I guess I don't need to remind you how it always ends up with your ghost cases and unfinished business? You'll become obsessive and violent about it, and in the end, you'll be the monster that needs to be put down."

Dean nods, bitter, but not regretful. Resolute. "Yeah, had read all the fine print long ago, know the whole package. But if it's the price to pay to get Cas back," he shrugs, "so be it."

"As you wish." Death's gaze remains fixed on him, disapproving. "Hope you get what you want, Dean Winchester."

With that, Death leaves the building.

Dean didn't notice when Sam had left too, along with his own old body. The room is empty again, with nothing alive -- only half a dozen dead vampires and one dead ghost ex-hunter.

*Great,* Dean thinks, mockingly, taking a breath -- doesn't need to anymore but old habits die hard, even if just to make the familiar motion for self-comfort.

He walks outside. The sun pierces through him, casting onto the ground without shadow. He examines his translucent hands and body, glancing back at the no-shadow.

"Got work to do," he sighs, casting a quick glance upwards automatically, as if sensing a gaze from a place that exists out of his reach, as if picking up something in another wavelength from his new spiritual form without registering it.

<br>

### Act 3-1

> **Outline:**  To free Dean's spirit and to save Cas, they call Jack to help, but God has no power in Empty, so it's up to themselves.

*No. This is not happening. Dean can't possibly be this stupid...*

Cas feels his heart clutch and squeeze. Or is it the Empty pulling at and poking it, nearly snapping it out of his chest?

"Enjoying the show?" The voice sounds behind him. Cas grimaces.

"This is not real." He glares at the entity. This has to be a lie, just to... to what? Make him give up? Surely Dean can't really make *that* decision? With all he knows, he still decided to stay behind?

The Shadow laughs. "But it is. As real as you and me -- or, well, just me."

The sensation from his body pales in comparison to what is happening inside his mind now. The desperation and sorrow hit harder than ever, and then, there is anger. Anger at himself for not being there, anger at Dean for making stupid decisions like he always does, anger at the world and the Empty for eternally teasing them, playing with them without end.

Bitterness, sourness, pain, angst -- every feeling mixed and blended together like a big thick bowl of emotion soup. The black ether of emptiness pokes into his brain, churning through them, scooping them up.

"But don't worry," the Shadow smiles, its grin widening merrily. "The show isn't over yet. You can take your time."

<br>

Sam is outrageous.

It takes Dean six months to figure out how to gather some of his spiritual strength and finally shows up as a semi-transparent form. Sam nearly shoots him with a rock salt gun.

"What the hell, Dean?" Sam growls, putting the gun down.

Dean tries to give him a smile but doesn't quite carry. "I had to."

"You *had to*?" Sam raises his brows. "What, like something here is keeping you so you can't go? Or some unfinished business?"

Dean doesn't want to make it so obvious, but his head just tilts enough of an angle to give it all away.

Sam breathes out sharply. "It's about Cas, isn't it? You still believe you can bring him back?" Dean gives a silent, ghostly nod. "It's been five years, Dean! There's no proof or anything giving us any sign that Cas can still *be* brought back! You can't possibly turn yourself into a vengeful spirit just for such a long shot."

"But it's still a shot. So I'll just keep trying," Dean snaps, not really listening to other things his brother has to say. Guess Death was right -- being a ghost limits your focus. You can only think about one thing, and for Dean, that's enough.

Sam smiles sadder than he saw him that time they were splitting half a dozen pies at the Pie Fest.

"Don't you dare salt-and-burn me now," Dean warns, reading his face, knowing what's in his mind. "I just need a bit more time, that's all."

"Except I already did." Sam gives him a glance before averting the look again as if he can't bear looking at him in this form for too long. "So if there is nothing else keeping you here, I guess thinking straight and accepting the truth is the only way to be free."

*But I am accepting the truth.* Dean thinks. *Just not the truth they think they know.*

Cas's look at him that night in the bunker. Cas's tears, his smile, and then... Cas's confession. The big secret truth.

It took Dean one second to realize it *was* the truth -- has always been, will always be, for both of them, for the longest time either can remember. But it only took the Empty half a second to be summoned and take Cas away.

Too slow. Too little. Too late.

So he can't give up, can't let go, can't move on. Dean decides. He just can't.

<br>

Dean doesn't expect to see Jack back in the bunker so soon again. Sam leads him to the dining table.

"I, uh, prepared too much dinner. Thought you might want a family dinner once in a while, you know." Sam sets an empty plate in front of the kid, scooping him a large spoonful of mashed potatoes. Jack looks like just a kid again, especially as he sits at the bunker's dining table, eating homemade mashed potatoes with chicken and sprouts -- Sam's specialty.

"Thank you, Sam," Jack tells him, enjoying the food. Sam watches him from across the table, gripping his spoon far too tightly, having the saddest smile. The corners of his eyes glisten with something wet.

Jack sees his face, putting down the spoon slowly. "Sam?"

"It's just... really good to see you again," Sam manages, forcing whatever food he was holding down the pipe, swallowing hard.

"I'm sorry about Dean," Jack says. All-knowingly. With a quieter voice than usual.

Sam looks up fast. "So you know."

"Of course I know. I'm God, remember?"

"Yes, yeah... umm." Sam pauses, glancing around, as if expecting someone to join them. He doesn't see Dean's flickering spiritual form. "Do you think there is any chance you can help get Dean out of this ghost phase? Please?"

Jack follows his gaze, checking around, also not seeing Dean, but he must have checked beyond just the bunker's dining room. "I can," the young God says. "But is that also what Dean wants?"

Sam puts down the food, almost snapping, but forces the voice controlled at the last minute. "Dean doesn't know what he's doing! He can't think straight these last few years ever since Cas was gone, he's certainly not in the right state of mind to make the decision to stay a ghost!"

"I heard he's been praying... to Cas, all the time." Jack is not affected by Sam's sudden rising voice.

Sam lowers his head sheepishly. "I think so too. I mean, I didn't hear it all the time, he didn't always say the words out loud, but yeah... wouldn't be surprised if he did."

"And you don't think it would work?" Jack asks him, his tone neutral.

Sam glances around. "Five years should be enough if it could work, right? But Cas is still not here. Guess that says it all."

"Maybe it needs ten years. Or longer." Dean pops up not far from them, leaning on the doorframe, his ghostly shape flickering for a second before stabilizing into his figure. "Ever heard of that shepherd's boy and the bird story? The bird that sharpens its beak on the diamond mountain every hundred years?"

"Hello, Dean," Jack turns to him, smiling a little. Dean nods at him in return, the same gentle smile.

"But you won't stay a ghost for five more years and still in your own mind, Dean! You wouldn't even remember your own name, who you are, what you've been through!" Sam rushes desperately.

"But I'd still remember the one thing keeping me here," Dean states, calm and matter-of-fact. "That I have to bring Cas home."

Sam gives a raspy exhale, turning back to Jack. "Jack, please, he wouldn't listen to me. Maybe he'll listen to you."

Jack fixes his gaze on Dean's form, only the tiniest twitch in his expression showing it's not as stoic as he was trying to maintain. "Do you really think you can bring Cas back? Do this one thing I couldn't do?"

Dean meets the kid's eyes, finding it as earnest as he'd found back when he was merely a newborn looking for his father, the very raw and bare look of a son, a child missing his father. Dean can't help swallowing hard.

"Yes," he tells him. "At least I will try my damn hardest, because, like you said, we all want him back terribly badly."

"Okay then," Jack nods and smiles, turning back to Sam. "I think it's okay then."

*The kid wants Cas back probably just as much as Dean, no wonder.* Sam realizes then, more than ever, that the new God is actually still *just* Jack, a three-year-old who loves Castiel like a father.

Jack flies away after dinner, after hanging around for a moment to help with the dishes and feed the dog.

Dean pops away as well, shortly after.

<br>

### Act 3-2

> **Outline:** Dean is painful and hopeless and keeps letting the *emptiness* in his heart eat him up, after long enough, his heart is so *empty* that he goes in the Empty too. Cas catches him as he falls in, they find each other.

Ghosts can't drive cars, not exactly -- except for that one time a ghost decided to *possess* Baby, which was unforgivable. So hanging out in the Impala is not an option anymore.

But popping in and out can do the trick too, Dean decides. Not as precise on the landing spot, and it exhausts him to the extent that he would fade behind the Veil so long that he nearly forgets what he was doing or where he was going. But still, it's the closest thing he's ever had that is remotely similar to flying. Maybe it's just like having angel wings to fly around. He haunts the idea.

The very first place he pops to is the graveyard he dragged himself out of the soil and ground, bones and metals blasted away from the central explosion point -- the place where he climbed out of the Pit.

That land is still deserted, the yard barren. The nearest gas station still has all the broken glass scattered across the floor. The very first place he ever heard Cas's voice, the first place he sensed Cas's existence before knowing anything about angels at all. He hovers around the threshold, then drifts inside through the window -- not like walls or glass can stop him now.

There is dried blood on the floor, cut by the broken glasses. Must have been his when he dodged the blast, trying to hide away from the sound that was so high-pitched that made his ears buzzing. He wonders what Cas was saying to him at that time, the very first words he was saying but he couldn't understand. Calling his name, perhaps -- that must be how the syllables of "Dean Winchester" sound in the angel's true voice. Pity that he can't understand, can't hear a thing. He doesn't even ever remember to ask Cas about that time, about what he had to say.

It was almost always Cas listening to what *he* had to say, not the other way around.

Dean swallows, feeling worse than before he entered this place.

He can't find anything here anyway, not like Cas has left anything behind on his way here for him to collect. Hanging around for mere minutes, and then he can't remember why he's even here. Just to know that Cas is not, and the place is just a big reminder of *empty* and lost.

His memory might just be as scattered as the glass on the ground, his heart bitten away one more piece by the nothingness in the place.

He moves on, hovering and lingering, wondering where and how and why. But nothing gives him an answer, nowhere has anything helpful, no one can even give him anything that is remotely any comfort. Just nothing, always nothing, always *empty*, always the lost.

Dean drops by the barn where he first saw him, the bench where they sat close by outside the witch's town, the deserted factory where he was asked to torture Alastair, the warehouse that was decorated as Heaven's greenroom in California, even the brothel he led Cas into for no more than a handful of hours, among all the other places.

The memory of when he was still a living human indeed fades fast, like Death warned. Soon enough, he can barely remember what they were doing the last year they were still hanging around together, let alone a decade ago. The locations blur together, and soon, so are all the people's faces.

Once, he finds himself wandering outside of the bunker not knowing where or why he's here. Sam happens to walk out of the door just then. Dean stares at him like a total stranger, like that time when the witch's spell wiped his memory clean, and the very few things he had to force himself to remember when staring at a mirror were: "I am Dean Winchester. Cas is my best friend."

He doesn't think he really needs that first sentence. And the second one could use a little change.

He's afraid he might forget about Cas's feature altogether. It's been too long. Too damn long. The photo in his wallet he used to take out at night, staring while praying, the photo of Cas in the funny cowboy hat that he's so fond of, has long faded and discolored. The memory of that time when he thought he lost him for good was imprinted in his human brain, but it's fading too just like the photo in his ghost brain, washing away like leaves in the tide.

Dean doesn't know how long it's been, where he is, or what he's doing. He doesn't know if he still has any heart left to be eaten away by more disappointment and hopelessness. He doesn't know how much memory he has left, or how much of himself has left. He's fading too, he thinks, just like smoke in the wind.

But he still prays. More like mere murmuring and whispering now. The one name, the one thing in his mind that is still hanging there.

"Cas."

"Cas --"

"Cas..."

Repeating it like it's a charm. A spell. A magic. A solution.

Tying whatever leftover remnants of his existence to it, holding onto it, like a drowning man holding onto the floating scrap of wood in the middle of the sea, in the middle of a storm.

The universe might as well be a hurricane, it makes no difference. Dean Winchester is drowning, fading, falling. Into the despair, into the end, into the utter, ultimate, absolute emptiness he has found in his heart.

The absence of Castiel, is the emptiest empty that any Empty can imagine.

<br>

And that, must be how *it* happens.

Castiel doesn't expect it, the Empty doesn't expect it, Dean certainly doesn't expect it.

But where does one go, when there is nothing left in them to be taken, when the hole in the heart is so vast that there is no heart remains, when the surrounding and the whole world matter nothing and have no difference to pure dark and black, indistinguishable from the void, when themselves *are* empty. Where do they go?

They go to the Empty.

Castiel sees it all, and he feels it all. He watches Dean popping in and out in his shaky flickering ghost form; he watches Dean talking to figures that are not there but are so obviously all variations of himself, Dean forgetting his own name but still murmuring his, Dean wandering the earth, lost, painful, hopeless, having nothing, *becoming* nothing, turning empty. It's always the Empty. The same Empty that is tearing him apart, the same empty they're sharing being separated.

He watches Dean falling apart, falling through, falling into the Empty where he is.

For a brief moment, Castiel doesn't realize what is happening. No one does.

The opening view over his head that the Shadow taunts him with tears open. Light from the living world and physical existence pour through, along with the broken figure of one Dean Winchester.

Cas reaches for him, desperate, instinctive. The tentacles from the black ether are still on him, dragging and pulling, tightening and locking, he might tear himself in half if he stretches too far, but nothing matters.

Castiel holds his hand, opens his palm, and in the center of the light, Dean falls into him. The essence of the ghost flickers, the last remnant of his soul blinks, this is still Dean, all the same.

He falls, but not into nothing, this time. But into the only existence that has ever mattered.

The light trembles, the shape wavers, and then he sees him. And the shape solidifies. Their eyes meet. Their minds register.

There is no word. Except for one. The only syllable on the tip of their tongues that has been hovering for so long without a place to land and now it finally does.

"*Cas.*"

"*Dean.*"

The universe restarts. The singularity point of the Big Bang is nothing more than this.

<br>

### Act 3-3

> **Outline:** Dean responds to Cas's confession, so now his heart is no longer *empty*, it's filled with feelings. And so the Empty is no longer empty, which is unbearable to the Empty and it loses control of them. So they use this feeling as their connection back to the earth and escape the Empty.

The shapes stabilize, the lights around them blaze, glaring and blinding, piercing through the abyss.

Dean can't believe it, neither can Castiel. They blink, they gasp, they choke.

They reach out. Their hands touch. Their bodies, cold and warm, tight and pained, but real. They're real.

Dean throws his arms around, and Cas meets him halfway. The embrace is so tight that nothing in the universe could stand in their way, not even the black tentacles of the Empty. They retreat in the dazzling light like wild animals intimated by a camper's bonfire.

Dean buries his face in Cas's shoulder, his body shaking, tears shredding free. "I thought I lost you for good."

Cas is the same, there is no stopping the stream down his face. "I thought so too when you became a ghost."

That creates seconds of silence. Dean stiffens at the words, but he doesn't let go. In sobbing sounds, he gasps, "You knew? You saw me...?"

Cas is smiling again, the tears tangling, the same watery smile that he had the last time they saw each other, but a truly happy one. "Yes," he tells him. "You woke me up, for a while already. I see you, all the time. And I hear you, everything. It was supposed to be my eternal punishment, but seeing you... hearing you... it was no punishment at all." He glances overhead. The opening rift is closed now, there is nothing to see because Dean is already here.

Dean pulls back from the hug, eventually, after a long, long while. Half a step back, he takes Cas in, up and down, down and up. Registering him, memorizing him, branding his figure into the deepest of his soul and brain.

He takes a breath, his voice shuddering. "Cas," he says, sound so broken that he can barely continue, but he pushes through, looking him in the eyes, more tears spilling over. "I *have to* see you, because I *have to* let you hear this --"

"I love you too."

Now, the smile on Cas's face *now*, *that* is the real true happiness he should have, not the shattered teary one back in the bunker.

Cas smiles, his eyes glitter with the brightest, the most beautiful light, his whole existence beams with happiness. He parts his lips, he answers, with one word that covers everything that all the languages in the universe and all the history that have ever been and would ever be invented have to say --

"*Dean.*"

And that is all Dean needs to hear. And he hears them all.

*There,* he thinks, *now he's okay if the universe ends, or begins, or grows into a million other different versions. He's okay with anything now.*

The hole in his heart grows back, the tear and the wound healed, filled with so many things that it's stuffed too big to even fit his chest. It overflows, turning into more tears and wider smiles and happiness and relief and all the things he doesn't know words for. He lets them all flow through him, lets them wash over him, feeling the brightness shining from his beating heart, the lightheaded sensation rush in the back of his head, the hope and joy and content and everything racing inside his veins. He looks at Cas in front of him, feeling new and reborn.

"The one thing you want --" he reaches for Cas's hand, pressing it over his own chest, heart beating fast and eager under, and then presses it to his lips. He tells him, "-- is something you already have -- Me."

Cas breathes out, happy. All the happiness the world has ever seen added together would have no match for the happiness at this moment, on his face, in his eyes.

Not too slow, not too little, not too late. Not this time. Not again.

Cas's eyes follow Dean's hand, then fall on the place where his own hands get led to, on the place where Dean's lips press. His eyes land on there, then flicker back to Dean's eyes. Blue crystal meets green amber.

Dean swallows, pulling him over by the hand, the other hand reaching Cas's shoulder, pressing him close. Cas's hands on the back of his head.

His lips fall on Cas's, touching ever so gently. Light as a feather's stroke.

Cas kisses back. Chaste.

His lips are dry and chapped, but warm and *real*, it's the best thing in the world.

Dean closes his eyes, moaning lowly in happiness, pressing in deeper.

He feels something in his chest expanding, exploding, something can't ever get contained inside his body anymore. Dean doesn't need to open his eyes to sense the light flowing from his own body, radiating the place like how Cas used to lighten up and shine. Is it his soul or just the feelings that are materializing and overflowing into something bright?

His fingers sense a touch of vibration. From behind the eyelid, the golden bright light escaping Cas pierces through, humming in electricity and intensity. The power of an angel, full and strong, warm and reassuring.

Without hesitation, they embrace, in forms not even they know possible. But it feels so right, the touch and unison to the very core of their existence, the soul and the grace, entangled to every atom of the bodies and every photon of the light. At this moment, they merge as one.

<br>

They are definitely *not empty* anymore.

They become the opposite of empty -- they are full, they are complete, they are whole. The feelings and emotions overflow from them, leaking into their surroundings, shining the space like rising suns on the sky. Bright and brilliant, blinding and dazzling.

The Shadow materializes itself behind them, covering its eyes, pained by the brightest sunshine, deafened by the exploding sound of tears dropping and hearts beating. It grimaces and twitches, recoiling and writhing, dying, in their presence. "What have you done?!" It snarls, voice fractured with rage and agony.

They separate, shapes back to human forms, fingers still entangled.

Dean turns to it, grinning. "Nothing, just a little natural, healthy expression of feelings." He exchanges a knowing, meaningful look with Cas, their hands still holding together, clasped tight.

That's when Cas realizes it. "You can't bear it. The love and happiness, our feelings fill the Empty so full that they're tearing it apart."

In the Shadow's glare, a crack splits open by their feet.

They jump in without a second thought, hands held, eyes locked, hearts full. Leaving the Empty behind.

<br>

### Act 4

> **Outline:** After coming back, Cas is an angel again, Dean is back alive. They're free to do whatever they want, they finally have the peace and happiness and freedom they've been fighting for so long, they can enjoy the fruit of what they fought for and live in a world that is better now.

The ground is solid, the tree is standing, the sun shines warm on their faces, leaving their silhouettes behind.

Dean breathes out, "God, it's good to be back."

Castiel closes his eyes, feeling the warmth of sunshine sink into his skin, sniffing the scent of grass in the air.

"It's real," he murmurs in agreement, still minor unbelievable. "We're back, and alive."

That is when he feels the arms around him, tight. Arms of the kid.

"Jack!" he holds him, patting his back.

"I missed you so much," Jack tells him, not stoic, not god-like, voice trembling even.

Cas tells him, soft, "Me too." And then, "Dean told me all about you, how everything was going well while I was away. I'm proud."

The kid beams brightly, like all the kids approved by their father. "I did my best." then, his gaze lowers. "Except for this one thing I couldn't do, I'm sorry I couldn't bring you back. How did you do that? Or how did Dean...?"

Cas glances toward Dean, who's standing not far away, sharing a heartfelt reunion hug with his brother now. "The oldest rule of the universe, I think. Love can conquer anything."

Jack hesitates, but curiosity still makes him wonder aloud, "Did Dean finally give you what you wanted most?"

Cas smiles, nodding without a doubt. "Yes. He did. Everything."

<br>

"So, what now? You wanna keep hunting? Or retired, take an extended vacation by the beach? Or like Bobby used to do, a new command center, training newbies?" Sam is the one who asks.

"Anything, hell, all of that." Dean shrugs. "Now we just, *live*. After everything we fought for, we never got to really *live* in this world, to enjoy life as promised, with all the peace and freedom and happiness. I mean, isn't it about bloody time? The paradise on Earth?"

"The paradise on Earth," Cas echoes, eyes gleaming. "Like the one Jack showed me a long time ago." He turns to the kid, realization settling in. "You never said it would be perfect, or Heaven-like, or monster-free, but it would be a world we could live, and love, and simply, *be*."

"And be *together*." Dean amends, emphasizing. This is important.

They share looks, smiling, understanding. Happy.

Full.

So it is decided. It is how life is going to be now -- there will be a *life*, finally.
