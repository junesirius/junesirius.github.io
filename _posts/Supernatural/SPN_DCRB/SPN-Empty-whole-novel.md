丁后悔，疯狂努力要救回卡

Jack：我知道他只有在真正快乐的时候才会被虚无带走，我很高兴至少在他走之前你给了他他最想要的。你亲吻他了吗？

丁（震惊）：什么？

米：告诉我你至少给了他拥抱。

丁：（更震惊难过，taken back，speechless说不出话）

Jack/米：（也震惊）所以你什么都没有给他？那他怎么……？

丁：（痛苦后悔）

丁在1520死之前一直在想卡的时候，念念不忘，然后像1520一样死了，但是死之后上不了天堂，灵魂变成鬼魂，因为有unfinished business，卡就是他的unfinished business。为了让丁灵魂解放，米召唤Jack/new God（或者这个很早就试过了），但是Jack也做不到，虚无独立于上帝力量之外。丁无望地痛苦，感觉内心有缺失空洞，空洞越来越大，然后因为内心的空洞就是一种empty，所以他的灵魂也进入Empty了（文字游戏）。在虚无里见到卡，唤醒卡（可能卡本来就没睡），回应卡的感情，于是虚无不再虚无，内心被填满，用情感充满了虚无，于是让他们俩不再虚无，虚无也就对他们没有掌控能力了，所以他们得以一起逃脱虚无（简单俗气地说就是用爱打败了反派）。回来以后卡重新变成天使，丁灵魂上天堂，俩人在天堂重逢继续快乐生活。（卡也许也会提议让丁再次复活，但是丁可能拒绝了，地球反正还会有卡和米保护的，他想要休息了，he earned it）

1323丁想要的退休海边生活他说过这是他earn的但是从来没得到过，也许可以作为这里的结局

## Main

### Act 0

> (canon) Cas dies to save Dean, the confession, the devastation, the pain, the lost. Has to tell Jack, Jack asks what makes Cas truly happy, Dean realizes he gives Cas nothing.

NO.

No, no, no, no, this is not happening.

Dean feels his body moves ahead, reaching out. Lips trembling.

Cas.

He cries out his name, matching his gazes. His throat is not working. But he's shouting the angel's name. Cas, Cas --

But Castiel does not hear him. His shouts are buried inside. Dean watches the teary smile, pinned frozen by the pained happiness in his eyes. The most hopeless, devastated happiness. But still, it's happiness that he can see.

"Don't do this, Cas." his lips move. He pleads. His heart thumps as hard as Billie's whacking on the door. The countdown to their death. Or their departure.

Don't.

His eyes burning hot. He can't cry. Not now. Not when tears will blur his vision of the angel. Of Cas. Of Cas when he said he ...

Don't do this, Cas... Don't say goodbye. Don't leave me.

Dean's mind is saying, screaming, he doesn't know if his lips follow the order. He can't breath. The feeling in his stomach twists the entire internal organ upside down.

Don't go, Cas. Don't die... Please.

And then, all is over. Like a dream. A bad dream waking up. Or a good one interrupted.

There is just silence. Dead, empty, silence all over him.

No Cas.

No Cas any more.

He just loses him. Again.

Dean's eyes burn boiling hot. He can't hold back them anymore.

For the first time in a long time, he cries. It happens so fast. Every second stretch to minute, minute to hour, hour to eternity. Too fast, but too slow. Too many times. Cas's last sentences echo in his mind, looping over and over.

He should have said something back. Why is there always so little time. Why is it always have to be goodbye.

The world is ending, outside. Dean buries his face in between his knees, staring at the vibrating phone with Sam's name on it, realizing, distantly. But his world just ended. Already. Right in front of him. In a big pile of black goo.

<br>

Dean doesn't know how he managed to get out of the bunker, get into the car, get on the road. The body did all the motions. He's not there.

There is no one on the road. He doesn't even notice until he's on the road for way too long. The world is horribly wrong, but somehow the quiet, the empty, the silence outside the window feels right. It might feel even worse if the Earth continues rotating and there are people talking and laughing when Cas is gone.

Sam and Jack are waiting for him. The duty of saving the Earth is still waiting for him.

Dean drags himself out of the car. Feeling way too tired to focus on what he should do. Why does it have to be them? But in the end, Cas sacrifices for him so he can do his job, Cas loves him for being good at it, doesn't he? Dean walks towards them.

Everyone's eyes are full of grief. For a different reason.

Dean doesn't know if he can say anything, about what happened, or do anything, next. He feels the head dizzy, too heavy. His whole body feels sick. Numb and sluggish.

This can't be happening. Cas, the world, any of it. Worse than the worst nightmare he ever had. Is it still not the time of snapping out of a bad dream?

"Where is Cas?" Two steps away from them, Jack is the first to ask. Sam looks at him with the same question in his eyes.

Another gigantic wave of sickness washes through him. There is no word, more than sorrow, more than grief. What's the word for this ocean of blue emotion that is flushing him up and down, scurrying him under the water? He's breathless.

Lost.

This is the word. Lost.

He can't look Jack in the eyes. Cas is his father.

But he has to tell. Sooner or later.

He swallows hard. There are blades in his throat. Every swallow, every sentence, the words are cutting him new wound. Bleeding.

They already know the answer. Just by looking at him. But he has to say it. Cas is... Cas... He chokes. Cas is gone.

Dean forces the words out, one word at a time. Eventually. "Cas saved me."

He tells them about the deal, the deal he only learned about before Cas was taken, the deal Jack has known since beginning but never said a thing.

He tells them all that he know, except for the truth.

The truth of what is Cas's true happiness.

But none of them are idiots.

Jack has sparkling tears in his eyes too. Dean only now realizes so belatedly how close they must be, the father and the son. The bond he never really look close enough.

But Jack smiles, looking into Dean's eyes. "But I'm glad," the kid says. "At least before he's gone, you gave him what made him truly happy, what he always wanted. Did you kiss him?"

Dean can't breath. "What?"

Jack blinks, somehow surprised. "Please tell me at least you hugged him?"

Dean stares at him, speechless.

The kid -- that is barely three years old and practically knows nothing about how human emotions work, but somehow able to sense so acutely -- widens his eyes. "You didn't give him anything? Then how... how does Cas get his true happiness?"

How indeed.

Dean turns around, can't bare their eyes one more seconds. Can't bare the thoughts crawling inside himself one more seconds.

Cas doesn't deserve this. He doesn't deserve Cas's ...

He didn't give him anything. He didn't even...

Dean forces his stare stay on something in the distance, in the skyline, staring so long without blinking that tears falling down from the corner of the eyes again.

The world is mourning with him. The empty silence in the universe. The vacuum of existence, the tear in the reality, the hole in the heart.

There is no bird singing, no dog barking, no human talking. No sound, no laughter, no life, because --

Cas is gone. So nothing is whole again. Nothing will ever be. Or it is just how Dean sees it -- would see it, even if it's not the reality.

<br>

### Act 1

> **Outline:** So after Cas is taken by the Empty, Dean gets so devastated that he spends most of his remaining time trying to access Empty and save Cas back but can't -- he thinks he can't but actually his yearning already reaches the Empty and wakes Cas up, except Cas can't come back to him, only can see him from beyond.

And then, there is the end of it, just like all the finish line of other world-ending events, the good wins the evil, the "happy" ending with people celebrating. Chuck gets taken out, and Jack becomes the new God.

Except, there is no celebration. Only mourning. Only funeral.

They don't even have a body to burn.

Dean brings a trench coat that looks exactly the same to the pyre. The pyre he insists on chopping and stacking all by himself.

Something about ceremonial memorial.

Jack comes. Standing besides Sam and Dean. Deja vu of three years.

And the kid -- the new God -- apparently remembers what Sam taught him last time.

He says thank you, then says sorry, and at last says good bye.

Dean can't say anything. Eyes red, burning hot, looking straight at the burning blame with fabrics of the coat flying in the air.

He stands right here watching Cas's body burning like this, three years ago, believing that would be the end of Cas. And then, he came back. So maybe this time, luck can be on their side too? With some miracle and the new God on their side?

Dean's knees give way. Jack startled. "Dean!"

Dean doesn't care about anything anymore, whatever social manner or how to face a new and highest celestial being or face a boy that is like your son. He can only think of one thing.

"You have to bring him back." Dean chokes, looking up at the kid from low, pleading. "You're the God, Jack. I'd only ask this one thing from you and never trouble you again, but you *have* to bring Cas back."

"Dean--" Jack holds his arms and helps him up, his eyes as clean as the kid used to be, as deep and sad just as Cas used to look. This is a miracle itself that Jack even looks like Cas. And what he says is a blow on Dean's head. Jack says, "I can't, Dean. I'm sorry."

But he did it last time, even before he realized what he could do. Dean thinks, hard, arguing, and telling him so.

"God has no power in the Empty," Jack tells him. "Not even I know how did my pray reach Cas and wake up, maybe it's just because I want him back really, really badly."

But I want him back just as badly, and more. Dean thinks, this time he doesn't speak out the answer.

"Okay." He says, instead. "Guess I'll just keep praying."

<br>

He did. As he said.

Dean prays every day and night. He prays to Cas every time he thinks of him, and every time anything reminds him of the angel.

He pours a cup of coffee from the bunker coffee machine, and thinks, "Cas, didn't you use to order coffee from Biggerson's?" he grins at the steaming hot bitter liquid. "Want to come by try this one? Bet homemade is better than those from stores."

He turns on the TV and tunes to the nature channel, watching the creatures with the most bewildered names running around, chasing each other, hunting or mating. Dean scoots over, leaving half the sofa empty as if pretending someone is just going to walk straight into the room, sitting next to him, sharing his popcorn and enjoying the show.

"You'd like this, wouldn't you, Cas?" he talks to the bowl of popcorn. "Never can get you into the western movies, but nature works for me. You hear me? So better move your ass down here and don't keep me waiting."

The other side of the sofa keeps cold.

<br>

Sam tries to talk to him once or twice. But Dean brushes him off.

"It wouldn't work." Sam catches him talking into a plate of bacon one morning. "You know that. The denial, the pretense, all those stages. Dean, as much as I feel you, you have to move on. It's not healthy. Excuse me for saying this, but you were like this when Dad was gone, and then when Mom was gone. Now with Cas... It's like it's getting even worse. Man, you need to buck up."

Dean doesn't need to look him to know the pitifulness in his brother's drooping puppy eyes. Sam doesn't know what he knows, how can he feel what he feels? Dean continues with his bacon, with too much attention.

"You never know," Dean throws a glance at Sam's general direction, not meeting his eyes. "Cas has come back from the Empty before, maybe he just need a little help to come back again. Hell, Nick wakes *Lucifer* up from the Empty just by thinking about him strongly enough, because that sicko thinks he *wants* the devil back. Maybe we just haven't wanted strong enough? So quit talking me out of it, you should join me praying and thinking and *wanting* like I do, we might bring Cas home earlier."

Sam sighs. He might have said something about that was when Chuck was still around, maybe things worked differently back then, maybe that mechanism expired with Chuck gone. Because... because certainly everyone with eyes can see if Dean's *want* is not strong enough, then no one's would ever be. Dean stops listening.

Sam leaves the kitchen without saying anything else.

Dean just keeps doing what he's determined to do. Thinking, praying, wanting, yearning -- whatever you call it, whatever the universe or the Empty can work with -- he's taking Cas home. Even if it's the last thing he'd ever done for the rest of his life.

<br>

The fact is, the emotions do get beamed into the Empty like a laser beam, shining bright the corner where the sleeping angel is lying.

"Cas." Dean's voice knock at his temple.

"Cas. We need you. *I* need you." Cas is disturbed in his eternal sleep, his body -- the body that is materialized by the Empty -- twitching.

"Cas, please--" Dean is definitely crying, the muffled sound, the wet choking sound, the pained desperate sound, piercing through Castiel's sleeping ear, reaching deep.

The angel opens his eyes, looking into the pure blackness in front of him.

*The Empty.* Castiel recognizes this place immediately. Arriving and fumbling around for the third round does make one getting familiar with a place, however unwanted one may be.

Cas stands up -- he can't see or feel his body, or the ground, or the air, the Empty is truly empty, but he thinks about the motion anyway, trying to pin himself somewhere, instead of flowing in the pure empty darkness.

He pins himself on the voice reaching him consistently -- Dean's voice.

Dean's voice that is calling his name, begging and pleading, among other things he's telling him, the random, small daily life things, the coffee, the popcorn, the bacon -- all the things that are on the Earth, with their color and shape and texture and taste, all the things that are real enough and certainly *not* empty. He pins his own existence on it.

Cas thinks he can see his own body now. Or the small amount of space near him, lit up by some lumination radiated just from his existence.

He chooses a direction, and starts walking ahead.

<br>

"Aren't you that annoying little bug, buzzing in my head again?" Not very surprised this time, the shadow "friendly neighborhood cosmic entity" that rules the Empty takes shape several steps behind him -- the shape of himself.

Cas turns to him, looking at the Shadow that is so close to his own reflection but also so different.

"Yes," he says, squinting, silently challenging, betting his chance. "It's me again. And I'm awake again."

The Shadow makes a truly annoyed sound. Cas wonders if the same trick and bargain could work twice.

"I know what you're thinking." it gloats. "Don't think for a second I'll let you go back again."

"Why not?" Cas tries to stand more straight, head high. He has to go back, one way or another -- he can't keep Dean waiting, he certainly can't let Dean sound like that broken for one more minute.

How long has he been gone and asleep? Cas wonders. How long has he made Dean so sad? Do they manage to win the ultimate fight and get their freedom? There are still so many things he wants to know, so many words to say. Even if nothing else, he wants so badly to just *be* there, by his side. In the end, it's all about just *being*, as he realized, isn't it? No reciprocation needed.

"Because." the cosmic entity says, tone mocking. "You would just keep popping in, and I have to keep popping you out. What am I, amusement part ticket teller? This is just another theme park to you annoying undead creatures?"

Castiel thinks hard. "I'll be careful this time." he says solemnly. "Won't disturb you for another eon, I promise."

The Shadow scoffs. "That's not the deal I made, remember? The deal was, you summon me, and I *own* you. Permanently, period. No new deal, no nothing. Did you forget, everything comes to the Empty, stays in the Empty. Shouldn't have left you out the first time."

So no deal then. Cas thinks bitterly. What is his chance of asking for something else?

"Okay, I stay here," he speaks as he considers, "but I assure you I won't go back to sleep. So what do you have in plan for the eternity to spend with me?"

Castiel tries a smirking smile, "I hope you have a big enough stock for board game or DVD collections. I have finished binge the Game of Thrones, by the way."

The Shadow roars. Black emptiness spraying and splashing like dirty water in waste pipes.

"What about I torture you for eternity, while you watch what you can never go back to?"

At that, the view over the head of him opens up. For a split of second, Cas thinks he might be having illusions, that he's flying among the cloud like he used to do, taking an upside-down swirl, looking down at the Winchesters' house from high above. The view clears up, through the ceiling of the bunker, he can see the brothers. Walking, talking, occasionally throwing some cold jokes at each other, but the smiles barely reach eyes for either of them.

He scrutinizes Dean. Cas doesn't have sense of time in here, but Dean looks getting older so much faster than he used to be. How long has he been gone? Dean looks tired -- so tired that all strengths have been drained from his limbs and whole body. Head low, fingers loosely clutching a bottle of alcohol, slumping into the chair. Is he crying?

And then Dean's words reach him again. The familiar sound of this man, this brilliant beautiful man, but so rusty. Cas's mind wonders afar, did Dean ever cry? Cas has never seen him like that before. Is Dean feeling so sad all for him? Guilt of having to leave him like this crunches his heart.

Dean is saying, "Cas, I -- I probably should give up, like Sam said. But I can't, I just can't. With other people, after some time, I can move on. But not you, Cas, not you. I don't know why, but --" his voice chokes, "I just can't. Every time I think you might be in the Empty, alone, asleep, surrounded by other dead angels and demons, like in a giant awful graveyard. I -- I can't, no way I'd leave you there."

Dean glances upward. Cas's heart beats faster for a beat, as if for that split of a moment their gazes might have met. But he realizes the impossibility just fast enough.

Dean continues, "I just hope you can hear me, Cas. With everything we lost, I can't lose you again. Not like this. You have to wake up, you understand? Come back to me, talk to me, let me know how I can help bring you back, because --" his voice breaks with a wet sound again, "because there are so many things I want to tell you."

Cas has to tear his eyes away from the view above. The opening in the Empty doesn't look like a real gate, more like a huge projector screen on the ceiling. No way through except for the look.

"Is it real?" he asks, redundantly. Dean's voices already tell the answer, but he has to ask.

"Very." the tip of the Shadow's mouth jerks up. This entity is clearly enjoying itself too much.

"Why? Why show me all this, but not let me go back?"

"Because I want to punish you!" The Shadow scolds. "You're loud, you're annoying, and bad boys get punished. So consider this your eternal punishment. Hey, on the bright side, you get to watch your boyfriend from here for eternity -- oh wait, only until he dies -- while you, I assure you, just going back to sleep would be a far better option for you."

At that, he starts to feel the pain in his body and mind. Black goo shapes and wraps around him, acting like ropes and whips and knives. Cutting him, piercing him, drilling holes then filling in the wounds, or healing him just to cutting him again. Like the Prometheus and the Greek eagle. Trapped and punished for eternity.

Cas almost laughs. If he gets to be punished like Prometheus, that surely means he finally did something good, right? Saving the flame, or saving Dean.

Cas lets the sensation of pain and agony resting at the periphery of his mind, looking up through the projection at Dean again, smiling.

If this is the cost to pay, if this is what can keep Dean safe, then all is worth it.

"Dean," he murmurs, knowing too well the human wouldn't be able to hear him from the Earth but Cas says it anyway. "Don't worry about me. Just, go live the life, be yourself. Be happy."

He chews his own word, considering, saying it again. "I'm already happy enough, Dean. Now it's your turn. You should find your true happiness without me now."

### Act 2

> **Outline:** Then Dean dies as 15.20 canon shows in an everyday vampire job, but after the death he can't go to heaven because he has unfinished business (he hasn't saved Cas yet, Cas is his unfinished business) so he becomes a ghost. To free Dean's spirit and to save Cas, they call Jack to help (or maybe they have tried this earlier), but God has no power in Empty, so it's up to themselves.

### Act 3

> **Outline:** Dean is painful and hopeless and keeps letting the *emptiness* in his heart eat him up, after long enough, his heart is so *empty* that he goes in the Empty too. Cas catches him as he falls in, they find each other, Dean responds to Cas's confession, so now his heart is no longer *empty*, it's filled with feelings. And so the Empty is no longer empty, which is unbearable to the Empty and it loses control of them. So they use this feeling as their connection back to the earth and escape the Empty.

### Act 4

> **Outline:** After coming back, Cas is an angel again, Dean is a ghost that has his business finished, so his soul can go to Heaven, they reunite happily in the Heaven. (Cas may have offered to bring Dean back to earth again, but Dean maybe decides to deny the resurrection because he wants to rest now, he earns it -- he gets the retirement life by the sea as he said he always wanted)
