## Draft

丁后悔，疯狂努力要救回卡

Jack：我知道他只有在真正快乐的时候才会被虚无带走，我很高兴至少在他走之前你给了他他最想要的。你亲吻他了吗？

丁（震惊）：什么？

米：告诉我你至少给了他拥抱。

丁：（更震惊难过，taken back，speechless说不出话）

Jack/米：（也震惊）所以你什么都没有给他？那他怎么……？

丁：（痛苦后悔）

丁在1520死之前一直在想卡的时候，念念不忘，然后像1520一样死了，但是死之后上不了天堂，灵魂变成鬼魂，因为有unfinished business，卡就是他的unfinished business。为了让丁灵魂解放，米召唤Jack/new God（或者这个很早就试过了），但是Jack也做不到，虚无独立于上帝力量之外。丁无望地痛苦，感觉内心有缺失空洞，空洞越来越大，然后因为内心的空洞就是一种empty，所以他的灵魂也进入Empty了（文字游戏）。在虚无里见到卡，唤醒卡（可能卡本来就没睡），回应卡的感情，于是虚无不再虚无，内心被填满，用情感充满了虚无，于是让他们俩不再虚无，虚无也就对他们没有掌控能力了，所以他们得以一起逃脱虚无（简单俗气地说就是用爱打败了反派）。回来以后卡重新变成天使，丁灵魂上天堂，俩人在天堂重逢继续快乐生活。（卡也许也会提议让丁再次复活，但是丁可能拒绝了，地球反正还会有卡和米保护的，他想要休息了，he earned it）

1323丁想要的退休海边生活他说过这是他earn的但是从来没得到过，也许可以作为这里的结局

### Edit notes

(overall) restrain "think" V.O., more descriptive scenes, "show it, don't tell it", less adj., more n./v.

(overall) change some of the "Empty" to "Shadow"

(pace) after Dean goes into the Empty, the pace is a little rushed, need reread to follow -> make what happened clearer

(plot) after they reunite, could make it more emotional, more than hug, maybe a little first kiss (pending), some soul-grace entanglement maybe, make it more intense to balance out the angst

## Main

### Act 0

> (canon) Cas dies to save Dean, the confession, the devastation, the pain, the lost. Dean has to tell Jack, Jack asks what makes Cas truly happy, Dean realizes he gives Cas nothing.

*NO.*

*No, no, no, no, this is not happening.*

Dean feels his body moves ahead, reaching out. Lips trembling.

*Cas.*

He cries out his name, matching his gazes. His throat is not working. But he's shouting the angel's name. *Cas, Cas --*

But Castiel does not hear him. His shouts are buried inside. Dean watches the teary smile, pinned frozen by the pained happiness in his eyes. The most hopeless, devastated happiness he's ever seen. But still, it's happiness that he can see. It's Cas's happiness that he's witnessing, for the first time. And the last.

"Don't do this, Cas." his lips move. He pleads. His heart thumps as hard as Billie's pounding on the door. The countdown to their death. Their separation. For eternity.

*Don't.*

His eyes are burning hot. He can't cry. Not now. Not when tears will blur his vision of the angel. Of Cas. Of Cas when he said he...

Dean breaths hard.

*Don't do this, Cas... Don't say goodbye. Don't leave me.*

Dean's mind is saying, screaming, he doesn't know if his lips follow the order. He can't breath. His stomach twists the entire internal upside down, stirs into scramble.

*Don't go, Cas. Don't die... Please.*

And then, all is over. Like a dream. A bad dream waking up. Or a good one interrupted.

There is just silence. Dead, empty, hopeless silence all over him. All around him.

No Cas.

No Cas any more.

Forever. He said. Gone.

He just lost him. Again.

Dean's eyes burn boiling hot. He can't hold back them anymore.

For the first time in a long time, he cries. It all happened so fast. Too fast then, too slow now. And too many times. Every second stretches to minute, minute to hour, hour to eternity. Cas's last sentences echo in his mind, looping over and over.

He should have said something back. Why is there always so little time. Why is it always have to be goodbye.

The world is ending, outside. Dean buries his face in between his knees, staring at the vibrating phone with Sam's name on it, realizing, distantly. But his world just ended. Already. Right in front of him. In a big pile of black ether.

<br>

Dean doesn't know how he managed to get out of the bunker, get into the car, get on the road. The body did all the motions. He's not there. Not really.

There is no one on the road. He doesn't even notice it until he's on the road for way too long. The world is horribly wrong, but somehow the quietness, the emptiness, the silence outside the window feels right. It might feel even worse if the Earth continues spinning and there are people talking and laughing when Cas is gone.

Sam and Jack are waiting for him. The duty of saving the Earth is still waiting for him.

Dean drags himself out of the car. Feeling way too tired to focus on what he should do. Why does it always have to be them? But in the end, Cas sacrifices for him so he can do his job, Cas *loves* him for being good at it, for caring, for saving, for doing what he does, doesn't he? Dean walks towards them.

Everyone's eyes are full of grief. Everyone for a different reason.

Dean doesn't know if he can say anything, about what happened, or do anything, next. He feels the head dizzy, too heavy, dragging his body down. His whole body feels sick. Numb and sluggish. Shutting down.

*This can't be happening. Cas, the world, any of it.* Worse than the worst nightmare he ever had. Is it still not the time of snapping out of the bad dream?

"Where is Cas?" Two steps away from them, Jack is the first to ask. Sam looks at him with the same question in his eyes.

Another mountainous wave of sickness washes through him. There is no word, more than sorrow, more than grief. What's the word for this ocean of pressure on his chest like water flushing him up and down, engulfing him under the surface? He's breathless. Drowning.

*Lost.*

This is the word. *Lost.*

He can't look Jack in the eyes. How do you tell a son about losing his father. Losing for him. Because of him.

But he has to tell. Sooner or later.

Dean swallows hard. There are blades in his throat. Every swallow, every sentence, the words are cutting him new fresh wounds. Bleeding never stop. Wounds that will never heal again.

They already knew the answer. Just by looking at him. The mess he is. But he has to say it. *Cas is... Cas...* He chokes at the thought. *Cas is gone.*

Dean forces the words out, one word at a time. Eventually. "Cas saved me."

He tells them about the deal, the deal he only learned about before Cas was taken, the deal Jack has known since beginning but never said a thing.

He tells them all that he knows, except for the truth.

The truth of what is Cas's true happiness.

But none of them are idiots.

Jack has sparkling tears in his eyes too. Dean only now realizes so belatedly how close they must be, the father and the son. The bond he never really look close enough.

But Jack smiles, looking into Dean's eyes. "But I'm glad," the kid says. "At least before he's gone, you gave him what made him truly happy, what he always wanted. Did you kiss him?"

Dean can't breath. "What?"

Jack blinks, somehow surprised. "Please tell me at least you hugged him?"

Dean stares at him, speechless.

The kid -- that is barely three years old and practically knows nothing about how human emotions work, but somehow able to sense so acutely -- widens his eyes. "You didn't give him anything? Then how... how does Cas get his true happiness?"

How indeed.

His stomach roils and lurches. Dean turns around, can't bare their eyes one more seconds. Can't bare the thoughts crawling inside himself one more seconds.

*Cas doesn't deserve this. He doesn't deserve Cas's...*

He didn't give him *anything*. He didn't even...

Dean forces his stare stay on something in the distance, in the skyline, staring so long without blinking that tears falling down from the corner of the eyes again.

The world is mourning with him. The empty silence in the universe. The vacuum of existence, the tear in the reality, the hole in the heart.

There is no bird singing, no dog barking, no human talking. No sound, no laughter, no life, because --

Cas is gone. So nothing is whole again. Nothing will ever be. Or it is just how Dean sees it -- would see it, even if it's not the reality.

<br>

### Act 1

> **Outline:** So after Cas is taken by the Empty, Dean gets so devastated that he spends most of his remaining time trying to access Empty and save Cas back but can't -- he thinks he can't but actually his yearning already reaches the Empty and wakes Cas up, except Cas can't come back to him, only can see him from beyond.

And then, there is the end of it, just like all the finish lines of other world-ending events, the good wins the evil, the "happy" ending with people celebrating. Chuck gets taken out, and Jack becomes the new God. So all is settled.

Except, there is no celebration. Only mourning. Only funeral.

They don't even have a body to burn.

Dean brings a trench coat that looks exactly the same to the pyre. The pyre he insists on chopping and stacking all by himself.

Something about ceremonial memorial.

Jack comes. Standing besides Sam and Dean. Deja vu of three years ago.

And the kid -- the new God -- apparently remembers what Sam taught him last time.

He says thank you, then says sorry, and at last says goodbye.

Dean can't say anything. Eyes red, bloody and glassy, looking straight at the burning flame with fabrics of the coat flying in the air.

He remembers standing right here watching Cas's body burning like this, three years ago, watching the body wrapped by the white curtain turning into chars, believing that would be the end of Cas. The pain almost destroyed him back then. He doesn't know how he survived that -- or maybe he wouldn't have, if Cas didn't come back. But he did, Cas came back. So maybe this time, luck can be on their side again? With some miracle and the new God on their side?

Dean's knees give way. Jack is startled. "Dean!"

Dean can't care about whether it's appropriate or not -- not to a boy that is like his son, not to a new and high celestial authority like the others he never knelt before. He can't think about any of that, he can only think of one thing -- one person.

"You have to bring him back." Dean chokes, teary, looking up at the kid from low, pleading in a way he never did to anyone, for anyone, at any time. "You're the God, Jack. I'd only ask this one thing from you and never trouble you again, but you *have* to bring Cas back."

"Dean--" Jack holds his arms and helps him up, his eyes as clean and innocent as they used to be, as deep and sad just as Cas looked like, near the end. This is a miracle itself that Jack even looks like Cas. But what he says is a blow on Dean's head.

Jack says, "I can't, Dean. I'm sorry. I tried, but it didn't work."

*But he did it last time, even before he realized what he could do, didn't he? He must can do it again.* Dean thinks, hard, arguing, and tells him so.

"God has no power in the Empty," Jack tells him, factually. "Not even I know how did my pray reach Cas and wake him up last time, maybe it's just because I wanted him back really, really bad."

*But I want him back just as bad. And more. Must be more.* Dean thinks, this time he doesn't speak out the answer.

"Okay." He says, instead. "Guess I'll just keep praying."

<br>

He does. As he said.

Dean prays every day and night. He prays to Cas every time he thinks of him, and every time anything reminds him of the angel. He prays in silence and in words.

He pours a cup of coffee from the bunker coffee machine, and thinks, "Cas, didn't you use to order coffee from the Biggerson's?" He contemplates at the steaming hot bitter liquid. "Want to come by trying this one? Bet homemade is better than those premade."

He turns on the TV and tunes over a few channels, stopping at a nature channel, watching the creatures with the most bewildered names running around, chasing one another, hunting or mating. Dean scoots over on the sofa even without himself noticing, leaving half the space vacant as if someone is just going to walk straight into the room, sitting next to him, sharing his popcorn and enjoying the show.

"You'd like this, wouldn't you, Cas?" he talks to the bowl of popcorn, then at the TV screen. Some creature on the screen chirp back at him. "Never can get you into the western movies, but you know what? Nature works for me. You hear me? So better move your ass down here and don't keep me waiting."

The other side of the sofa remains cold.

<br>

Sam tries to talk to him once or twice. Or three times. But Dean brushes him off.

"You're praying to him again, aren't you?" Sam catches him staring at a plate of bacon with far too much attention one morning. "It won't work. And you know that. The denial, the pretense, all those stages. Dean, as much as I feel you, you have to move on. It's not healthy. Excuse me for saying this, but you were exactly like this when Dad was gone, and then when Mom was gone. Now with Cas... It's like it's getting even worse. Man, you need to buck up. I'm sorry, but he's gone, and he's not coming back this time."

Dean doesn't need to look at him to know the pitifulness in his brother's drooping puppy eyes. Sam doesn't know what he knows, how can he feel what he feels? Dean continues fiddling with his bacon with a fork, eyes focused on it but not looking.

"You never know," Dean throws a glance at Sam's general direction, not meeting his eyes. "Cas has come back from the Empty before, maybe he just need a little help to come back again. Hell, Nick wakes *Lucifer* up from the Empty just by *thinking* about him strong enough, because that sicko thinks he *wants* the Devil back. Maybe we just haven't *wanted* strong enough? So quit talking me out of it, you should join me praying and thinking and *wanting*, we might bring Cas home earlier."

Sam sighs. He might have said something about that was when Chuck was still around, maybe rules worked differently back then, maybe that mechanism expired with Chuck gone. Because... because certainly anyone with eyes can see if Dean's *want* is not strong enough, then no one's would ever be. Dean stops listening.

Sam leaves the kitchen without saying anything else.

Dean just keeps doing what he's determined to do. Thinking, praying, wanting, yearning -- whatever you call it, whatever the universe or the Empty can work with -- he's taking Cas home. Even if it's the last thing he'd ever do for the rest of his life.

<br>

The fact is, the emotions do get transmitted into the Empty like a laser beam, shining bright the corner where the sleeping angel is lying.

"Cas." Dean's voice knock at his temple.

"Cas. We need you. *I* need you." Cas stirs in his eternal sleep, his body -- the body that is materializing slowly in the Empty -- twitching.

"Cas, please--" Dean is definitely crying, the muffled sound, the wet choking sniff, the pained desperate gasp, piercing through Castiel's sleeping ears, reaching deep down, tugging.

The angel opens his eyes, looking into the pure blackness in front of him.

*The Empty.* Castiel recognizes this place immediately. Arriving and fumbling around for the third round does make one getting familiar with a place, want or not.

Cas stands up -- he can't see or feel his body, or the ground, or the air, the Empty is truly *empty*, but he thinks about the motion anyway, trying to pin himself somewhere, instead of flowing in the pure void nothingness.

He pins himself on the voice reaching him consistently -- Dean's voice.

Dean's voice that is calling his name, begging and pleading, among other things he's telling him, the random small daily human life things, the coffee, the popcorn, the bacon -- all the things that are on the Earth, with their color and shape and texture and taste, all the things that are real enough and certainly *not empty*. He pins his entire existence on it.

Cas thinks he can see his own body now -- finally solidified. The small amount of space closest to him lit up by some lumination radiated from something inside his chest.

He chooses a direction, and starts walking.

<br>

"Aren't you that annoying little bug, buzzing in my head again?" Not very surprised this time, the shadowy "friendly neighborhood cosmic entity" that is the personalization of the Empty takes shape several steps behind him -- the shape of himself.

Cas turns to it, looking at the Shadow that is so alike to his own reflection but also nothing close.

"Yes," he says, squinting, silently challenging, betting his chance. "It's me again. And I'm awake again."

The Shadow makes a truly annoyed sound. Cas wonders if the same trick and bargain could work twice.

"I know what you're thinking." It gloats. "Don't think for a second I'll let you go back again."

"Why not?" Cas tries to stand more straight, head high. He has to go back, one way or another -- he can't keep Dean waiting, he certainly can't let Dean sound like that broken for one more minute.

*How long has he been asleep?* Cas wonders. *How long has he made Dean so sad? Do they manage to win the ultimate fight and get their peace and freedom?* There are still so many things he wants to know, so many words to say. Even if nothing else, he wants so bad to just *be* there, by his side. In the end, it's all about just *being*, as he realized, isn't it? But he needs to *be*.

"Because," the cosmic entity says, tone mocking. "You would just keep popping in, and I have to keep popping you out. What am I, amusement park ticket teller? This is just another theme park to you annoying undead creature?"

Castiel thinks hard. "I'll be careful this time." he says solemnly. "Won't disturb you for another eon, I promise."

The Shadow scoffs. "That's not the deal we made, remember? The deal was, you summon me, and I *own* you. Permanently, period. No new deal, no nothing. Did you forget, everything comes to the Empty, stays in the Empty? Shouldn't have let you out the first time."

*So no deal then.* Cas thinks bitterly. What is his chance of scraping for something else?

"Okay, I stay here," he speaks as he considers, "but I assure you I won't go back to sleep. So what do you have in plan for the eternity to spend with me?"

Castiel aims for a smirking smile, thinking it's what Dean would say. "I hope you have a big enough stock for board games and DVD collections. I have finished binging the Game of Thrones, by the way."

The Shadow roars. Black hollow ether spraying and splashing like dirty water in waste pipes.

"What about I torture you for eternity, while you watch what you can never go back to, until you give up what you're holding on to and finally go back to sleep like a good boy should?"

At that, the view over the head opens up. For a split of second, Cas thinks he might be having hallucinations, that he is flying among the cloud again like he used to do, long time ago, taking an upside-down swirl, looking down at the Winchesters' house from high above. The view clears up, through the ceiling of the bunker, he can see the brothers. Walking, talking, occasionally throwing some cold jokes at each other, but the smiles barely reach eyes for either of them.

He finds Dean, quick enough. He scrutinizes him. Cas doesn't have sense of time in here, but Dean looks so much more worn out than he used to be. The body is the familiar shape as he built from all these years ago, but aged by time that no one has control over. The wrinkled crow's foot, the dark bags under his eyes, the constant furrow between his brows. How long has he been gone really? Dean looks tired -- so tired that all strengths have been drained from his limbs and whole body. Head low, fingers loosely clutching a bottle of alcohol, slumping into the chair. Is he crying?

And then Dean's words reach him again. The familiar sound of this man, this brilliant beautiful man, but so rusty. Cas's mind wanders afar, did Dean ever cry? Cas has never seen him like that before. Is Dean feeling so sad all for him? Guilt of having to leave him like this crunches his heart.

Dean is saying, "Cas, I -- I probably should give up, like Sam said. But I can't, I just can't. With other people, after some time, maybe I can move on. But not you, Cas, not you. I don't know why, but --" his voice chokes. "I just can't. Every time I think you might be in the Empty, alone, asleep, surrounded by other dead angels and demons, like in a giant awful graveyard. I -- I can't, no way I'd leave you there."

Dean glances upward. Cas's heart skips a beat, as if for that split of a moment their gazes might have met. But he realizes the impossibility just quick enough.

Dean continues, "I just hope you can hear me, Cas. With everything we lost, I can't lose you again. Not like this. You have to wake up, you understand? Come back to me, talk to me, let me know how I can help bring you back, because --" his voice breaks with a wet sound again, "because there are so many things I want to tell you."

Cas has to tear his eyes away from the view above. The opening in the Empty doesn't look like a real gate, more like a huge projector screen on the ceiling. No way through except for the look.

"Is it real?" he asks, dubiously, redundantly. Dean's voices already tell the answer, but he has to ask.

"Very," the tip of the Shadow's lip jerks up. This entity is clearly enjoying itself too much.

"Why? Why show me all this, but not let me go back?"

"Because I want to punish you!" The Shadow scolds. "You're loud, you're annoying, and bad boys get punished. So consider this your eternal punishment. Hey, on the bright side, you get to watch your boyfriend from here for eternity -- oh wait, only until he dies -- while you, I assure you, going back to sleep would simply be a far better option for you."

At that, he starts to feel the pain in his body and mind. Black ether of emptiness shapes and wraps around him, acting like ropes and whips and knives. Everywhere it touches, the existence does not. Cutting him, piercing him, drilling holes then reaching through the wounds, reaching deep inside. And when it retreats temporarily, Cas finds himself healed, wounds filled with fresh-grown newly-materialized bones and flesh -- only to be cut open and drilled and minced, again, and again. Like the Prometheus and the Greek eagle, with the repeatedly eaten and regrown liver. Trapped and punished for eternity.

Cas almost laughs. If he gets to be punished like Prometheus, that surely means he finally did something good, right? Saved the humans. Saved Dean.

If the Empty thinks *this* can make him succumb, then it doesn't know him very well.

Cas lets the sensation of pain and agony resting at the periphery of his mind, looking up through the projection at Dean again, smiling.

*If this is the cost to pay, if this is what can keep Dean safe, then all is worth it.*

"Dean," he murmurs, knowing too well the human couldn't hear him from the Earth but Cas says it anyway. "Don't worry about me. Just, go live the life, be yourself. Be happy."

He chews his own word, considering, saying it again. "I'm already happy enough, Dean. Now it's your turn. You should find your true happiness without me."

<br>

### Act 2

> **Outline:** Then Dean dies as 15.20 canon shows in an everyday vampire job, but after the death he can't go to heaven because he has unfinished business (he hasn't saved Cas yet, Cas is his unfinished business) so he becomes a ghost.

"Hey Cas, don't laugh at me alright? But I might have called your phone far too many times, remember you still have that ridiculous voicemail message? Yeah we're so gonna change it when you come back."

"Cas, I know I told Sam I'd turn in early and get some sleep, but... I can't. I keep thinking about the early times when we met, you know? So many times you'd startle me when I wake up finding you stare at me. Man, it's really creepy to watch others sleep, but uh, I don't mind having that again now."

"Sam dragged me back to hunting again. I didn't want to go, but he insisted. Guess that must be how he felt like when I took him out of Stanford. And guess what, it's a ghost, and a woman, just like the Woman in White. Sometimes it feels like time and everything is just a whole pile of bad joke, nothing changes from fifteen years ago except we're getting older. And, uh, we don't have angels on our shoulder then, so Cas, you want to pop in to prove me wrong?"

"Hey Cas, man, I know you don't need to sleep, this is probably catching up with all the sleep you missed in the past already. So rise and shine, time to get up."

"We got ourselves a shapeshifter case today. I hate him so much. He read my mind and... and... and he turned into you. Sammy had to take him down because I couldn't. I'm sorry, Cas. I know he's not you, but... it's been so long. I still can't. I'm sorry... I..."

"Sam doesn't know why we had a birthday cake for dinner today, and I ordered extra champagne -- I drank your share by the way, it's top shelf stuff. I just realized, with everything going on, we never get chance to decide a birthday or something for you. So, if no objection from you, I think I'll take the liberty and announce today your birthday. It's September 18th, Cas. You don't think I'd forget the time we first met, do you? Man, did I ever tell you that day when you walking in, Jesus, you are just... poof... you know. The light, the sound, the wind, it's crazy. It's... it's kinda awesome, I ever told you that? Sorry, rambling now, probably too much of that... umm... I'll get another, I'll just --"

"Cas, I think there is no more angel or heaven or Empty-related book I haven't read in the world. Sam helped too, but I read them all, just to be sure. So is all the magic and lore and people with power we can seek help from, but... there is nothing. I can't believe it, there is just nothing about how to bring you back. But I'll keep trying, alright? I swear, if this is the only thing I'll do before lights out, I'll do it right and bring you back."

"Cas -- it would be especially good to have you here today, it's a whole pack of wolves. So many more than we thought. Sam and I almost didn't make it out, but don't worry, we're fine now. A little hurt but no big deal. Just... been thinking about what would happen if we check out now. Where would we go, how would that leave you -- I haven't brought you back yet. I have this one job, and I'm gonna finish it."

"Hey Cas, gonna head out to a case today, think it's vamp. Probably just a milk run, some kids missing, the nest isn't even difficult to find. I'll tell you how it's going once it's finished, alright?"

<br>

Castiel watches, and listens. He hears them all. His body in pain, his brain being picked and poked, tendrils binding and scratching everywhere, but he keeps his eyes on the opening view the Empty gives him, locking his gaze on Dean and Dean alone.

He can see him, and he can hear him. Cas is already satisfied. This isn't even a too bad eternity, all things considered.

It's like listening to a voicemail in real time, you know the other side is right there, talking, but your hand is just too occupied you can't pick it up.

Castiel answers them regardless, in murmurs, or in choked voice, or in between spitting blood as his internals being turned and twisted, the black ethers reaching inside him, blending and slicing him like scrambled eggs. He thought the pained sensation would get dumbed after a while, but they're not. They are still sharp and acute with every touch of the torture.

But he focuses on the view -- on Dean -- strong enough, he can live with it, forgetting about the torture most of the time.

Cas answers the prayers as if Dean can hear him. He always answers to Dean's prayers, from heaven, from earth, from purgatory. He goes to him if he can, talks to him when he thinks he can hear, sends someone to check in on them when he has to -- never has he ignored his prayers. Why should the Empty be an exception. So hear or not, he says them anyway --

"Be careful, Dean. Ghosts can be tricky too."

"That is a lovely birthday cake, Dean. I like it, but you can take the cherry on top if you want. I'm not going to battle for it. And... I think you probably shouldn't keep drinking."

"You're hurt, Dean! The werewolf wounds, even if not the bite mark, they can get infected. I wish I could be there healing you."

"Dean, the vampires can be dangerous. Please be careful."

"Dean! Watch out that metal bar on the post behind you!"

"Dean!!"

*No, no, no--*

Cas's heart almost stops as the events in front of him unfold. He struggles so hard reaching towards the view he almost breaks free from the black entity's hold before getting dragged back.

Dean is hurt, he is so clearly fatally hurt. Ragged wound tore on his back, blood streaming down. Each word and each breath push out so difficult.

*I should be there.* Cas can't help himself, thinking desperately. *If I'm there, I can heal you.* His heart is crunched to pieces. But he's not there.

Dean is fading. And he can do nothing. He is too far away -- too dead, for him.

He understands the Empty's torture now. This is his ultimate punishment -- witnessing everything, but can't do anything, the absolute powerless, the incapability of saving the man he tried so desperate to save. In the end, it is a metal bar that got him, piercing through his body in the middle.

Castiel closes his eyes, letting the pain sinking in. The physical torture and sensation starts coming back, the wound and hole and tears, they all come back. Is it the same feeling that Dean's going through right now? But it's more than that, more than the physicality and sensation. It's the eternal pain of knowing Dean Winchester is dead, and he can't be there for him. He can't change it this time.

<br>

Dean breathes shallow, bearing the pain. The metal on his back is probably the only thing holding him now. Blood losing fast. He can feel himself fading. His fingers already start turning cold and feeble. His little brother looks at him in tears.

"It's okay." he smiles back at him, easily, breathing out slowly.

"No," Sam is saying, through wet eyes. "We'll figure something out, I can bring you back."

*Not this time, not anymore.* Dean thinks, determined, and tells him so. Enough of a ride, enough bending of the rule. If this is the day, then this is the day.

"If Cas was here --"

That makes Dean swallow hard, "but he's not." But he's not, he's... in a way worse place than he would go to next. The calm and easy face breaks down. The tears surge out. This is his finish line, but he hasn't finished everything yet. Always too little time. Always too many things unfinished.

Death is almost an old friend now, during this hell of a ride. Metaphorically and literally. Dean lets his tears fall, and lets his last breath leave the lung. The pain eases away, leaving him like stripping an old worn jacket. He walks out of his body, having to force his eyes away from his little brother holding the remain of his body, wailing on his shoulder.

"Hello, Dean." The Death, the original Horseman greets him, holding on to his exquisite cane, leaning by the other wall. Looking exactly like five years ago when Dean took him down.

Dean -- his soul or his consciousness, whatever he is now that still hold his own image -- takes half a step back, can't help himself.

"I'm sorry" is the first thing slipping out of his tongue at the sight of this familiar old Death. The old man looks older than the entire universe.

"I'm sorry what I did when I had to--" Dean explains, in a hurry, eyeing the Death's expression. He doesn't exactly have pickled chips for him this time as an apology.

"Dean." Death looks at him, expression soft and not unkind. "I'm not here to blame you, or hold old grudge, if that's what worries you."

"You're not?" Dean controls his voice, tight on edge, stepping closer slowly, one step at a time. "But I killed you."

"About that --" Death tilts his head slightly, looking up for a second -- the look of a human when they seek out God -- before locking his eyes on Dean again.

"You planned everything all along?" Dean realizes, gasping. "To reap the God?"

"Told you God can die too, long time ago, didn't I?" Death gives the tiniest hint of a smile, eyes with approval.

"So what now?" Dean swallows, preparing himself for an answer that he may not like. Eyeing upwards, then down, he wonders where the Death would lead him to, Heaven? Hell?

"I tell this to your brother the last time we met, and I'm telling this to you now, Dean Winchester." In his iconic solemn tone, Death tells him. "I try very hard to not pass judgement at times like this, but you..." A pause, he regards him, then, "Well played, my boy."

Dean blinks. Approval from the Death himself, he has to admit he'd never see this coming. He nods in appreciation, flattered.

"Now, whenever you're ready." Death half-turns, leading the way to a door that vaguely can be seen floating in the mid-air, glowing with a gentle warm light. Presumably the doorway to the afterlife.

Dean eyes the passage, considering. "Yeah, about that." He hesitates.

Death looks back at him, shooting a questioning look. "What's the matter, do you want to stay behind?"

"Is there any chance you can help bring Cas back from the Empty?" Dean blurts out, then adds. "Please?"

"I see, unfinished business, is it?" Death looks at the ground for a brief moment before looking back at Dean. "Unfortunately I can't. The Empty is -- in a one-way lockdown now, I'm afraid. I'm sorry."

Dean swallows again, nodding, thinking fast. "One-way, you say, so there is some way in. Can I go there?"

"Unless you're a dead angel or demon, which you're not." It's just the fact they both know and Death points out again.

"Billie threatened us before, saying she'd toss us to the Empty if we die again. Doesn't that mean you can toss me there too?" Dean holds onto the last straw like a drowning man.

"Billie," Death ponders the name. "I can see why she would say that. Tempting, isn't it? Funny how a threat could turn into a last hope. But that's what it is, a threat."

"So there is no way. Not even after I go to Heaven or Hell?"

"Not even then. Especially not after Heaven. You will have peace, trouble like this will leave you."

"I'll forget about Cas?"

"In time, yes." Death tells him, flat.

Dean wipes his eyes, breathing out.

"Sam is gonna hate me for this." He manages, not as nearly a joke as he hopes it to land.

"What are you saying?" Death says, tone warning and slow. "Don't make the mistake."

Dean manages a smile, decision made. "Think I'd stay behind for a bit, if that's okay with you, I'll catch up once I get this one thing done."

"Dean," Death presses, sounds more intimidating now. "You don't want this, becoming a ghost isn't what you think it's like. You can't bring the angel back as a living, why do you think you can achieve that as a ghost?"

Dean gives him a grin. "Well, can't blame a man for trying. For one, think I'd get more time working on that. But I know for sure I don't want to get to whatever afterlife paradise forgetting Cas's still in the Empty."

"Then guess I don't have to remind you how it always end up with your ghost cases with unfinished business? You'll get obsessive and violent about that unfinished business, at the end of the day, you're the monster to be put down."

Dean nods, bitter, but not regretful. "Yeah, had read all the fine prints long ago, know the whole package. But if it's the price to pay to get Cas back," he shrugs, "so be it."

"As you wish." Death's look still focuses on him, looking disapproving. "Hope you get what you want, Dean Winchester."

At that, Death leaves the building.

Dean didn't notice when Sam had left too, along with his own old body. The room is empty again, with nothing alive -- only half a dozen dead vampires and one dead ghost ex-hunter.

*Great.* Dean thinks, mockingly, taking a breath -- doesn't need to anymore but old habits die hard, even if just to make the familiar motion for self-comfort.

He walks outside. The sun pierces through him, casting onto the ground without shadow. He examines his translucent hands and body, looking back at the no-shadow.

"Got work to do." He sighs, casting a quick glimpse upward automatically, as if sensing a gaze from the place that exists out of his reach, as if picking up something in other wavelength from his new spiritual form without registering.

<br>

### Act 3-1

> **Outline:**  To free Dean's spirit and to save Cas, they call Jack to help, but God has no power in Empty, so it's up to themselves.

*No. This is not happening. Dean can't possibly be this stupid...*

Cas feels his hearts clutching and squeezing. Or is it the Empty pulling and poking it, almost snapping it out of his chest?

"Enjoying the show?" the voice sounds up behind him. Cas grimaces.

"This is not real." he glares at the entity. This has to be a lie, just to... to what? Make him give up? Surely Dean can't really make *that* decision? With all he knows, still decided to stay behind?

The Shadow laughs. "But it is. As real as you and me -- or, just me."

The sensation from his body is nothing compared to what is in his mind now. The desperation and sorrow comes stronger than ever, and then, there is anger. The anger of himself not being there, the anger of Dean making stupid decisions like he always do, the anger of the world and the Empty that keep teasing them, playing them with no end.

The bitterness, the sour, the pain, the angst. Every feeling mixed together like a big bowl of emotion soup. The black ether of emptiness pokes into his brain, churning at these, scooping them.

"But don't worry," the Shadow smiles even more merrily. "The show is not over yet, you can take your time."

<br>

Sam is outrageous.

It takes Dean six months to figure out how to gather some of his spiritual strength and finally shows up as a semi-transparent form. Sam almost shoots him with a rock salt gun.

"What the hell, Dean?" Sam growls at him, putting the gun down.

Dean tries to give him a smile but doesn't quite carry. "I had to."

"You *had to*?" Sam raises his brows. "What, like something here is keeping you so you can't go? Or some unfinished business?"

Dean doesn't want to make it so obvious, but his head just tilts enough of an angle to give it all away.

Sam breathes out. "It's about Cas, isn't it? You still believe you can bring him back?" Dean gives a silent ghostly nod. "It's been five years, Dean! There is no proof or anything giving us any sign that Cas can still *be* brought back! You can't possibly make yourself a vengeful spirit just for such a long shot."

"But it's still a shot. So I'll just keep trying." Dean snaps, not listening to other things his brother has to say. Guess Death is right, being a ghost also limits your attention range, you can only think about one thing. And for Dean, that's enough.

Sam smiles sadder than he saw him that time when they were splitting half a dozen pies at the Pie Fest.

"Don't you dare salt-and-burn me now." Dean reads his face, knowing what's in his mind. "I just need a bit more time, that's all."

"Except I already did." Sam gives him a glance before averting the look again as if he can't bare looking at him in this form for too long. "So if there is nothing else attaching you here, I'd guess thinking straight and accepting the truth would be the only way to be free."

*But I am accepting the truth.* Dean thinks. *Just not the truth they think they know.*

Cas's look at him that night, in the bunker. Cas's tears, Cas's smile, and then... Cas's confession. The big secret truth.

It took him one second to realize it *is* the truth -- has been, would always be, for both of them, for the longest time either can remember. But it only took the Empty half a second to be summoned and took Cas away.

Too slow, too little, too late.

So he can't give up, can't let go, can't move on. Dean decides. He just can't.

<br>

Dean doesn't expect to see Jack so soon in the bunker again. Sam leads him to the dining table.

"I, uh, prepared too much dinner. Thought you might want a family dinner once in a while, you know." Sam puts an empty plate in front of the kid, scooping him a large spoon of mashed potato. The kid looks like just a kid again, especially when he's sitting in the bunker dining table, eating homemade mashed potato with chicken and sprouts -- Sam's specialty.

"Thank you, Sam." Jack tells him, enjoying the food. Sam watches him, across the table, fisting around a spoon far too tight, having the saddest smile. Corner of his eyes gathering something wet.

Jack sees his face, putting down the spoon slowly. "Sam?"

"It's just really good to see you again." Sam manages, forcing whatever food he was holding down the pipe, swallowing hard.

"I'm sorry about Dean." Jack says. All-knowingly. With a lower voice than usual.

Sam looks up fast. "So you know."

"Of course I know. I'm the God, remember?"

"Yes, yeah. Umm," Sam pauses, glancing around, as if waiting for someone to join them. He doesn't see Dean's jittering spiritual reflection. "Do you think there is any chance you can help get Dean out of that ghost phase? Please?"

Jack follows his eyes, checking around, also not seeing Dean, but he must have checked more than just the bunker's dining room. "I can." the young God says. "But is that also what Dean wants?"

Sam puts down the food, almost snapping but controlling the volume at the last minute. "Dean doesn't know what he's doing! He can't think straight in the last few years ever since Cas was gone, he's certainly not in the right mind to make the decision of staying like a ghost!"

"I heard he's been praying, to Cas, all the time." Jack is not affected by Sam's suddenly raised voice.

Sam lowers his head sheepishly. "I think so too. I mean, I didn't hear it all the time, he didn't always say the words, but yeah, wouldn't be surprised if he did."

"And you don't think it would work?" Jack asks him, in a completely neutral tone.

Sam looks around. "Five years should be enough if it could work, isn't it? But Cas is still not here. Guess it says a lot by itself."

"Maybe it needs ten years, or longer." Dean pops up not far from them, leaning on the doorframe, his ghosting shape flickering for a second before stabilizing into his figure. "You ever heard of that shepherd's boy's story? The bird that sharpens its beak on the diamond mountain every hundred years?"

"Hello, Dean." Jack turns to him, smiling a little. Dean nods at him, same gentle smile.

"But you won't stay as a ghost for five more years and still in your own mind, Dean! You wouldn't even remember your own name, who you are, what you have been through!" Sam rushes desperately.

"But I'd still remember the one thing that keeps me here." Dean states, calm, matter-of-fact. "That I have to bring Cas home."

Sam gives a raspy breathing out, turning back to Jack. "Jack, please, he wouldn't listen to me, maybe he'll listen to you."

Jack focuses on Dean's shape, only the tiniest twitch on his face showing it's not as stoic as he was trying to maintain. "Do you really think you can bring Cas back? Do this one thing I can't do?"

Dean meets the kid's eyes, finding it as earnest as he'd found back when he was merely a new-born looking for his father, the very raw and bare look of a son, a kid missing his family. Dean can't help swallowing.

"Yes," he tells him. "At least I will try really, really hard, because like you said, we all want him back extremely badly."

"Okay then," Jack nods and smiles, turning back to Sam. "I think it's okay, then."

*The kid wants Cas back probably just as strong as Dean, no wonder.* Sam only then realizes that, and more than ever realizes the fact the new God is actually just Jack, a three-year kid that loves Castiel like his father.

Jack flies away after the dinner, after hanging around for a moment to help the dishes and feed the dog.

Dean pops out as well, shortly after.

<br>

### Act 3-2

> **Outline:** Dean is painful and hopeless and keeps letting the *emptiness* in his heart eat him up, after long enough, his heart is so *empty* that he goes in the Empty too. Cas catches him as he falls in, they find each other.

Ghosts can't drive cars, not exactly -- except for that one time a ghost decides to *possess* the Baby, that was unforgivable. So hanging out in the Impala is not an option anymore.

But popping in and out can do the trick too, Dean decides. Not as precise on the landing spot, and it exhausts him to the extent that he would fade from behind the vail so long that he almost forgets about what he was doing or where he's going. But still, it's the closest thing he ever get that is remotely similar to flying. Maybe it's similar to having angel wings to fly around. He haunts the idea.

The very first place he pops to is the graveyard he dragged himself out from the soil and ground, bones and metals blasted away from the central explosion point -- the place where he climbed out from the Pit.

That land is still deserted, the yard barren. The closest gas station still has all the broken glasses scattered on the floor. The very first place he heard Cas's voice and sensed Cas's existence before he knew anything about angel at all. He hovers around the threshold, then enters it from the window -- not like walls or windows can stop him now.

There are dried blood on the floor, cutting by the broken glasses. Must be his when he dodged the blast, trying to hide away from the sound that is so high pitched that made his ears buzzing. He wonders what it is that Cas was saying to him at that time, the very first sentence he was saying but he couldn't understand. Calling his name, perhaps, that must be how the syllables of "Dean Winchester" sounds like in angel's true voice. Pity that he can't understand, can't hear a thing. He doesn't even ever remember to ask Cas about that time, about what he had to say.

It's almost always Cas listening to what he has to say, not the other way round.

Dean swallows, feeling worse than before he entered this place.

He can't find anything here anyway, not like Cas has left anything behind in his way here for him to collect. Hanging around for mere minutes, and then he can't remember why he's even here. Just to know that Cas is not, and the place is just a big reminder of *empty* and lost.

His memory might just be as scattered as the glass on the ground, his heart bitten away one more piece by the nothingness in the place.

He moves on, hovering and lingering, wondering where and how and why. But nothing gives him answer, nowhere has anything helpful, no one can even give him anything that is remotely any comfort. Just nothing, always nothing, always *empty*, always the feeling of lost.

Dean drops by the barn where he first saw him, the bench where they sat close by outside the witch's town, the deserted factory where he was asked to torture Alastair, the warehouse that was decorated as Heaven's green house in California, even the brothel he led Cas into for no more than a handful of hours, among all the other places.

The memory of when he was still a living human indeed fades fast, like Death warned. Soon enough, he can barely remember what they were doing the last year they were still hanging around together, let alone a decade ago. The locations fuzz together, soon, so are all the people's faces.

Once, he found himself wandering outside of the bunker but not knowing where or why he's here. Sam happened to walk out of the door just then. He stared at him like he's a total stranger. Like that time when the witch's spell made him forget everything, and the very few things he had to force himself to remember when staring at a mirror were: "I am Dean Winchester. Cas is my best friend."

He doesn't think he still need that first sentence. And the second one could use a little change.

He's afraid he might forget about Cas's feature altogether. It's been too long. Too damn long. The photo in his wallet he used to take out at night, staring while praying, the photo of Cas in the funny cowboy hat that he's so fond of, has long faded and discolored. The memory of that time when he thought he lost him for good was imprinted in his human brain, but it's fading too just like the photo in his ghost brain, washing away like leaves in the wave.

Dean doesn't know how long it's been, where he is, and what he's doing. He doesn't know if he still have any heart left to be eaten away by more disappointment and hopelessness. He doesn't know how much memory he has left, or how much of himself has left. He's fading too, he thinks, just like smoke in the wind.

But he's still praying. More like mere murmuring now. The one name, the one thing in his mind that is still hanging there.

"Cas."

"Cas --"

"Cas..."

Repeating it like it's a charm. A spell. A magic. A solution.

Tying whatever leftover remnant of his existence onto it, holding on to it, like a drown man holding onto the floating wooden flank in the middle of the sea, in the middle of a storm.

The universe might as well be a hurricane, it makes no difference. Dean Winchester is drowning, fading, falling. Into the despair, into the end, into the utter, ultimate, absolute emptiness he has found in his heart.

The absence of Castiel, is the emptiest empty that any Empty can imagine.

<br>

And that, must be how *it* happens.

Castiel doesn't expect it, Empty doesn't expect, Dean certainly doesn't expect it.

But where does one go, when there is nothing left in them to be taken, when the hole in the heart is so huge that there is no heart remains, when the surrounding and the whole world matter nothing and have no difference to pure dark and black, when themselves *are* empty. Where do they go?

They go to the Empty.

Castiel sees it all, and he feels it all. He watches Dean popping in and out in his shaky flickering ghost form, he watches Dean talking to figures that are not there but are so obviously all variations of himself, Dean forgetting his own name but still murmuring his, Dean wandering in the ground, lost, painful, hopeless, having nothing, *becoming* nothing, turning empty. It's always Empty. The same Empty that is tearing him apart, the same empty they're sharing being separated.

He watches Dean falling apart, falling through, falling into the Empty where he is.

For a brief moment, Castiel doesn't realize what is happening. No one does.

The opening view over his head that the Shadow shows him tear open. Lights of the living world and physical existence pouring through, along with the broken figure of one Dean Winchester.

Cas reaches for him, desperate, out of instinct. The tentacles from the black ether is still onto him, dragging and pulling, tightening and locking, he might tear himself in half if he stretches too far, but nothing matters.

Castiel holds his hand, opens his palm, and in the center of the light, Dean falls into him. The essence of the ghost flickers, the last remnant of his soul blinks, this is still Dean, all the same.

He falls, but not into nothing, this time. But into the only existence that ever matters.

The light flutters, the shape staggers, then he sees him. And the shape solidifies. Their eyes meet. Their minds register.

There is no word. Except for one. The only syllable on tip of their tongue that's been hovering for so long without a place to land and now they finally do.

"Cas."

"Dean."

The universe restarts, the singularity point of big bang is nothing more than that.

<br>

### Act 3-3

> **Outline:** Dean responds to Cas's confession, so now his heart is no longer *empty*, it's filled with feelings. And so the Empty is no longer empty, which is unbearable to the Empty and it loses control of them. So they use this feeling as their connection back to the earth and escape the Empty.

The shapes stabilize, the lights around them glare more blindingly.

Dean can't believe it all, nor can Castiel. But it doesn't matter.

They reach out. Their hand touch. Their body, cold and warm, tight and pained, but real. They're real.

Dean throws his arms over, Cas meets him half-way. The embrace is so tight that nothing in the universe can stand in their way, not even the black tentacles of the Empty. They retreat in the dazzling light like wild animals intimated by camper's bonfire.

Dean buries his face on Cas's shoulder, tears shredding. "I thought I lost you for good."

Cas is the same, there is no stopping the stream down his face. "I thought so too when you become ghost."

That creates seconds of silence. Dean freezes in the words, but he can't let go. In sobbing sounds, he gasps, "You knew? You see me...?"

Cas is smiling again, the tears tangling, the same watery smile that he had last time they saw each other, but truly happy one. "Yes," he tells him. "You had waken me up. I see you, all the time. And I hear you, everything. It's supposed to be my eternal punishment, but being able to see you, it's no punishment at all." He glances overhead. The opening is closed now, there is nothing to see because Dean is already here.

Dean pulls back from the hug, eventually, after a long, long while. Half a step back, he takes Cas in, up and down, down and up. Registering him, memorizing him, branding his figure into the deepest of his soul and brain.

He takes a breathe, voice shuddering. "Cas," he says, sound so broken that he can barely continue, but he pushes through, looking him in the eyes, more tears flooding. "I *have to* see you, because I *have to* let you hear this --"

"I love you too."

Now, the smile on Cas's face *now*, *that* is the real true happiness he should have, not the shattered teary one back in the bunker.

Cas smiles, his eyes glitter with brightest light, his whole existence beams with happiness. He parts his lips, he answers, with one word that covers everything that all the languages in the universe and all the history that have ever been and would ever be invented have to say --

"Dean."

And that is all Dean needs to hear. And he hears them all.

*There,* he thinks, *now he's okay if the universe ends, or starts, or grows into a million other different versions. He's okay with anything now.*

The hole in his heart grows back, the tear and the wound healed, filled with so much things that it's stuffed too big to even fit his chest. It overflows, turning into more tears and wider smiles and happiness and relief and all the things he doesn't know words for. He lets them flow through him, washed through in all of them, feeling the brightness shining from the beating heart, the lightheaded sensation at the back of his head, the hope and joy and content and everything running inside his vain. He looks at Cas in front of him, feeling new and reborn.

"The one thing you want," he reaches for Cas's hand, pressing it onto his own chest, heart beating fast and eager under, and then under his lips. He tells him, "is something you already have -- me."

Cas breathes out, happy. All the happiness the world has ever seen adding together would have no match for the happiness at this moment, on his face, in his eyes.

Not too slow, not too little, not too late. Not this time. Not again.

<br>

They are definitely *not empty* anymore.

They become the opposite of empty, they are full, they are complete, they are whole. The feelings and emotions overflow from them, leaking into their surrounding, shining the space like rising Sun on the sky. Bright and brilliant, blinding and dazzling.

The Shadow materializes itself behind them, covering its eyes, pained by the rainbow and sunshine, deafened by the exploding sound of tears dropping and hearts beating. It grimaces and twitches, dying, in their presence. "What have you done!" it growls and struggles.

Dean looks at it, grinning. "Nothing, just some natural, healthy expression of feelings." He exchanges a knowing, meaningful look with Cas, their hands still holding together.

That's when Cas realizes it. "You can't bear it. The love and happiness, our feelings fill the Empty so full that they're tearing it apart."

In the Shadow's glare, a cracking opens by their feet.

They jump in without a second thought, hands held, eyes locked, hearts full. Leaving the Empty behind.

<br>

### Act 4

> **Outline:** After coming back, Cas is an angel again, Dean is back alive. They're free to do whatever they want, they finally have the peace and happiness and freedom they've been fighting for so long, they can enjoy the fruit of what they fought for and live in a world that is better now.

The ground is solid, the tree is standing, the sun shines warm on their face, leaving their silhouettes behind.

Dean breathes out, "God, it's good to be back."

Castiel closes his eyes, feeling the warmth of sunshine, sniffing the grass in the air.

"It's real." he murmurs in agreement, still minor unbelievable. "We're back, and alive."

That is when he feels the arms around him, tight. Arms of the kid.

"Jack!" he holds him, patting his back.

"I miss you so much." Jack tells him, not stoic, not god-like, voice trembling even.

Cas tells him, "Me too." And then, "Dean told me all about you, how everything is going on well when I was away. I'm proud."

The kid beams brightly, like all the kids approved by their father. "I did my best." then lowering his eyes. "Except this one thing I can't do, I'm sorry I can't bring you back. How did you do that? Or how did Dean...?"

Cas looks at Dean, who's standing not far away, sharing a heartfelt reunion hug with his brother now. "The oldest rule of the universe, I think, love can conquer anything."

Jack hesitates, but curiosity still makes him wonder aloud, "Did Dean finally give you what you wanted most?"

Cas smiles, nodding without doubt. "Yes. He did. Everything."

<br>

"So, what now? You want to keep hunting? Or retired or something?" Sam is the one asks.

"Anything, hell, all of that." Dean shrugs. "Now we just, *live*. After everything we fought for, we never get to really *live* this world, enjoy the life as promised, with all the peace and freedom and happiness. I mean, isn't it about the time? The paradise on Earth?"

"The paradise on Earth," Cas echoes, eyes gleaming. "Like the one Jack showed me long time ago." he turns to the kid, realization dawns. "You never said it will be perfect, or Heaven-like, or monster-free, but it will be a world we can live and love and just, *be*."

"And be *together*." Dean amends, emphasizing. This is important.

They share looks, smiling, understanding. Happy.

Full.

So it is decided. It is how the life is going to be like -- there will be a *life*, finally.
