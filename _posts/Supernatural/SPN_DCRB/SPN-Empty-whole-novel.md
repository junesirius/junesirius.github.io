丁后悔，疯狂努力要救回卡

Jack：我知道他只有在真正快乐的时候才会被虚无带走，我很高兴至少在他走之前你给了他他最想要的。你亲吻他了吗？

丁（震惊）：什么？

米：告诉我你至少给了他拥抱。

丁：（更震惊难过，taken back，speechless说不出话）

Jack/米：（也震惊）所以你什么都没有给他？那他怎么……？

丁：（痛苦后悔）

丁在1520死之前一直在想卡的时候，念念不忘，然后像1520一样死了，但是死之后上不了天堂，灵魂变成鬼魂，因为有unfinished business，卡就是他的unfinished business。为了让丁灵魂解放，米召唤Jack/new God（或者这个很早就试过了），但是Jack也做不到，虚无独立于上帝力量之外。丁无望地痛苦，感觉内心有缺失空洞，空洞越来越大，然后因为内心的空洞就是一种empty，所以他的灵魂也进入Empty了（文字游戏）。在虚无里见到卡，唤醒卡（可能卡本来就没睡），回应卡的感情，于是虚无不再虚无，内心被填满，用情感充满了虚无，于是让他们俩不再虚无，虚无也就对他们没有掌控能力了，所以他们得以一起逃脱虚无（简单俗气地说就是用爱打败了反派）。回来以后卡重新变成天使，丁灵魂上天堂，俩人在天堂重逢继续快乐生活。（卡也许也会提议让丁再次复活，但是丁可能拒绝了，地球反正还会有卡和米保护的，他想要休息了，he earned it）

1323丁想要的退休海边生活他说过这是他earn的但是从来没得到过，也许可以作为这里的结局

## Main

### Chap. 1

> **Outline:** So after Cas is taken by the Empty, Dean gets so devastated that he spends most of his remaining time trying to access Empty and save Cas back but can't -- he thinks he can't but actually his yearning already reaches the Empty and wakes Cas up, except Cas can't come back to him, only can see him from beyond.

### Chap. 2

> **Outline:** Then Dean dies as 15.20 canon shows in an everyday vampire job, but after the death he can't go to heaven because he has unfinished business (he hasn't saved Cas yet, Cas is his unfinished business) so he becomes a ghost. To free Dean's spirit and to save Cas, they call Jack to help (or maybe they have tried this earlier), but God has no power in Empty, so it's up to themselves.

### Chap. 3

> **Outline:** Dean is painful and hopeless and keeps letting the *emptiness* in his heart eat him up, after long enough, his heart is so *empty* that he goes in the Empty too. Cas catches him as he falls in, they find each other, Dean responds to Cas's confession, so now his heart is no longer *empty*, it's filled with feelings. And so the Empty is no longer empty, which is unbearable to the Empty and it loses control of them. So they use this feeling as their connection back to the earth and escape the Empty.

### Chap. 4

> **Outline:** After coming back, Cas is an angel again, Dean is a ghost that has his business finished, so his soul can go to Heaven, they reunite happily in the Heaven. (Cas may have offered to bring Dean back to earth again, but Dean maybe decides to deny the resurrection because he wants to rest now, he earns it -- he gets the retirement life by the sea as he said he always wanted)
