"Hey Cas, don't laugh at me alright? But I might have called your phone far too many times, remember you still have that ridiculous voicemail message? Yeah we're so gonna change it when you come back."

"Cas, I know I tell Sam I'd turn in early and get some sleep, but... I can't. I keep thinking about the early times when we met, you know? So many times you'd startle me when I wake up finding you stare at me. Man, it's really creepy to watch others sleep, but uh, I'd like that again now."

"Sam drags me back to hunting again. I didn't want to go, but he insisted. Guess that must be how he felt like when I took him out of Stanford. And guess what, it's a ghost, and a woman, just like woman in white. Sometimes it feels like the time is repeating itself, nothing changes from fifteen years ago except we're getting older. And, uh, we don't have angels on our shoulder then, so Cas, you want to pop in to prove me wrong?"

"Hey Cas, man, I know you don't need to sleep, this is probably catching up with all the sleep you missed in the past already. So rise and shine, time to get up."

"We got ourselves a shapeshifter case today. I hate him so much. He read my mind and... and... and he turned into you. Sammy had to take him down because I couldn't. I'm sorry, Cas. I know he's not you, but... it's been so long. I'm sorry... I..."

"Sam doesn't know why we had a birthday cake for dinner today, and I ordered extra champagne -- I drank your share by the way, it's top shelf stuff. I just realized, with everything going on, we never get chance to decide a birthday or something for you. So, if no objection from you, I think I'll take the liberty and announce today your birthday. It's September 18th today, Cas. You don't think I'd forget the time we first met, do you?"

"Cas, I think there is no more angel or heaven or Empty-related book I haven't read in the world. Sammy helped too, but I read them all, just to be sure. So is all the magic and lore and people with power we can seek help from, but... there is nothing. I can't believe it, there is just nothing about how to bring you back. But I'll keep trying, alright? I swear, if this is the only thing I'll do before light out, I'll do it right and bring you back."

"Cas -- it would be especially good to have you here today, it's a whole pack of wolves. So many more than we thought. Sam and I almost didn't make it out, but don't worry, we're fine now. A little hurt but no big deal. Just... been thinking about what would happen if we check out now. Where would we go, how would that leave you -- I haven't brought you back yet. I have one task and one task only, and I'll finish it."

"Hey Cas, gonna head out to a vamp case today. Should just be a milk run, a few kids missing, the nest isn't even difficult to find. I'll tell you how it's going once it's finished, alright?"

<br>

Castiel watches, and listens. He hears them all. His body in pain, his brain being picked and scratched, but he keeps his eyes on the opening view the Empty gives him, locking his gaze on Dean and Dean alone.

He can see him, and he can hear him. He's already satisfied. This isn't even a too bad eternity, all things considered.

It's like listening to a voicemail in real time, you know the other side is right there, talking, but your hand is just too occupied you can't pick it up.

Castiel answers them regardless, in murmur, or in choked voice, or in between spitting blood as his internals being turned by blenders formed and drilled by the black goo. He forgets about the torture most of the time.

He answers them as if Dean can hear him. He always answers to Dean's pray, from heaven, from earth, from purgatory. Why should the Empty be an exception. So he says them anyway.

"Be careful, Dean. Ghosts can be tricky too."

"That is a lovely birthday cake, Dean. I like it, but you can take the cherry on top if you want. I'm not going to battle for it."

"You're hurt, Dean. The werewolf wounds, even if not the bite mark, they can get infected. I wish I can be there healing you."

"Dean, the vampires can be dangerous. Please be careful."

"Dean! Watch out that metal hook on the post behind you!"

"Dean!!"

No, no, no--

Cas's heart almost stops as the events in front of him pan out. He struggles so hard reaching towards the view he almost breaks free from the black goo's hold before getting dragged back.

Dean is hurt, he is so clearly fatally hurt. Ragged wound tore on his back, blood streaming down. Each word and each breath push out so difficult.

*I should be there.* Cas can't help himself, thinking loud. *If I'm there, I can heal you.* His heart is crunched to pieces. But he's not there.

Dean is fading. And he can do nothing. He is too far away -- too dead, for that matter.

He understands the Empty's torture now. This is his ultimate punishment -- witnessing everything, but can't do anything, the absolute powerless, the incapability of saving the man he tried so desperate to save. In the end, it is a hook that got him.

Castiel closes his eyes, letting the pain sinking in. The physical torture and sensation starts coming back, the wound and hole and tears, they all come back. The eternal pain of knowing Dean Winchester is dead, and he can't be there for him. He can't change it this time.

<br>

Dean breathes shallow, bearing the pain. The hook on his back is probably the only thing holding him now. Blood losing fast. He can feel himself fading. His fingers already start turning cold and strengthless. His little brother looks at him in tears.

"It's okay." he smiles back at him, easily, breathing out slowly.

"No," Sam is saying, through wet eyes. "We'll figure something out, I can bring you back."

*Not this time, not anymore.* Dean thinks, telling him so. Enough of a ride, enough bending of the rule. If this is the day, then this is the day.

"If Cas was here --"

Dean swallows, "but he's not." But he's not, he's... in a way worse place than he would go to next. The calm and easy face breaks down. The tears come down. This is his finish line, but he doesn't finish everything yet. Always too few time.

Death is almost an old friend now, during this hell of a ride. Metaphorically and literally. Dean lets his tears fall, and lets his last breath leave the lung. The pain eases away, leaving him like stripping a jacket. He walks out of his body, having to force his eyes away from his little brother holding the remain of his body, wailing.

"Hello, Dean." The Death, the original Horseman greets him, holding on to his exquisite cane, leaning by the other wall. Looking exactly like five years ago when Dean took him down.

Dean -- his soul or his consciousness, whatever he is now that still hold his own image -- takes a step back, can't help himself.

"I'm sorry" is the first thing slips out of his tongue at the sight of this familiar old Death. The old man like looks like older than the entire universe.

"I'm sorry what I did when I had to--" Dean explains, in a hurry, eyeing the Death's expression. He doesn't exactly have pickled chips for him this time as apology.

"Dean." Death looks at him, expression soft and not unkind. "I'm not here to blame you, or hold old grudge, if that's what worries you."

"You're not?" Dean controls his voice, tight on edge, stepping closer slowly, one step at a time. "But I killed you."

"About that--" Death tilts his head slightly, looking up for a second -- the look of a human when they seek out God -- before locking his eyes on Dean again.

"You planned everything all along?" Dean realizes, gasping. "To reap the God?"

"Told you God can die too, long time ago, didn't I?" Death gives the tiniest hint of a smile, eyes with approval.

"So what now?" Dean swallows, preparing himself for an answer that he may not like. Eyeing upwards, then down, he wonders where the Death would lead him to, Heaven? Hell?

"I tell this to your brother the last time we met, and I'm telling this to you now, Dean Winchester," in his iconic solemn tone, Death tells him. "I try very hard to not pass judgement at times like this, but you..." A pause, he regards him, then, "Well played, my boy."

Dean blinks. Approval from the Death himself, he has to admit he'd never see this coming. He nods in appreciation.

"Now, whenever you're ready." Death half-turns, leading the way to a door that vaguely can be seen floating in the mid-air, glowing with a gentle warm light. Presumably the doorway to the afterlife.

Dean eyes the passage, considering. "Yeah, about that." He hesitates.

Death looks back at him, squinting. "What's the matter, do you want to stay behind?"

"Is there any chance you can help get Cas back from the Empty?" Dean blurts out, then adds. "Please?"

"I see, unfinished business, isn't it?" Death looks at the ground for a brief moment before looking back at Dean. "Unfortunately I can't. The Empty is -- in a one-way lockdown now, I'm afraid. I'm sorry."

Dean swallows again, nodding, thinking fast. "One-way, you say, so there is some way in. Can I go there?"

"Unless you're angel or demon, which you're not." Death points out.

"Not even when I go to Heaven or Hell?"

"Not even then."

Dean wipes his eyes, breathing out.

"Sam is gonna hate me for this." He manages, not as nearly a joke as he hopes it to land.

"What are you saying?" Death says, tone warning and slow. "Don't make the mistake."

Dean manages a smile, decision made. "Think I'd stay behind for a bit, if that's okay with you, I'll catch up once I get this one thing done."

"Dean," Death presses, sounds more intimidating now. "You don't want this, becoming a ghost isn't what you think it's like. You can't bring the angel back as a living, why do you think you can achieve that as a ghost?"

Dean gives him a grin. "Well, can't blame a man for trying. For one, think I'd get more time working on that. But I know for sure I don't want to get to whatever afterlife paradise forgetting Cas's still in the Empty."

"Then guess I don't have to remind you what it always end up with your ghost cases with unfinished business? You'll get obsessive and violent about that unfinished business, at the end of the day, you're the monster to be put down."

Dean nods. "Yeah, had read all the fine prints long ago, know the whole set. But if it's the price to pay to get Cas back," he shrugs, "so be it."

"As you wish." Death's look still focuses on him, looking disapproving. "Hope you get what you want, Dean Winchester."

At that, Death leaves the building.

Dean didn't notice when Sam had left too, along with his own old body. The room is empty again, with nothing alive -- only half a dozen dead vamps and one dead ghost ex-hunter.

*Great.* Dean thinks, taking a breath -- don't need to anymore but making the familiar motion.

He walks outside. The sun pierces through him, casting onto the ground without shadow. He examines his translucent hands and body, looking back at the no-shadow.

"Got work to do." He sighs, casting a quick look upward subconsciously, as if feeling a gaze from the place that exists out of his reach, as if picking up something in other wavelength from his new spiritual form.
