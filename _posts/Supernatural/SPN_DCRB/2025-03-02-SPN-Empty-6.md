The shapes stabilize, the lights around them glare more blindingly.

Dean can't believe it all, nor can Castiel. But it doesn't matter.

They reach out. Their hand touch. Their body, cold and warm, tight and pained, but real. They're real.

Dean throws his arms over, Cas meets him half-way. The embrace is so tight that nothing in the universe can stand in their way, not even the black tentacles of the Empty. They retreat in the dazzling light like wild animals intimated by camper's bonfire.

Dean buries his face on Cas's shoulder, tears shredding. "I thought I lost you for good."

Cas is the same, there is no stopping the stream down his face. "I thought so too when you become ghost."

That creates seconds of silence. Dean freezes in the words, but he can't let go. In sobbing sounds, he gasps, "You knew? You see me...?"

Cas is smiling again, the tears tangling, the same watery smile that he had last time they saw each other, but truly happy one. "Yes," he tells him. "You had waken me up. I see you, all the time. And I hear you, everything. It's supposed to be my eternal punishment, but being able to see you, it's no punishment at all." He glances overhead. The opening is closed now, there is nothing to see because Dean is already here.

Dean pulls back from the hug, eventually, after a long, long while. Half a step back, he takes Cas in, up and down, down and up. Registering him, memorizing him, branding his figure into the deepest of his soul and brain.

He takes a breathe, voice shuddering. "Cas," he says, sound so broken that he can barely continue, but he pushes through, looking him in the eyes, more tears flooding. "I *have to* see you, because I *have to* let you hear this --"

"I love you too."

Now, the smile on Cas's face *now*, *that* is the real true happiness he should have, not the shattered teary one back in the bunker.

Cas smiles, his eyes glitter with brightest light, his whole existence beams with happiness. He parts his lips, he answers, with one word that covers everything that all the languages in the universe and all the history that have ever been and would ever be invented have to say --

"Dean."

And that is all Dean needs to hear. And he hears them all.

*There,* he thinks, *now he's okay if the universe ends, or starts, or grows into a million other different versions. He's okay with anything now.*

The hole in his heart grows back, the tear and the wound healed, filled with so much things that it's stuffed too big to even fit his chest. It overflows, turning into more tears and wider smiles and happiness and relief and all the things he doesn't know words for. He lets them flow through him, washed through in all of them, feeling the brightness shining from the beating heart, the lightheaded sensation at the back of his head, the hope and joy and content and everything running inside his vain. He looks at Cas in front of him, feeling new and reborn.

"The one thing you want," he reaches for Cas's hand, pressing it onto his own chest, heart beating fast and eager under, and then under his lips. He tells him, "is something you already have -- me."

Cas breathes out, happy. All the happiness the world has ever seen adding together would have no match for the happiness at this moment, on his face, in his eyes.

<br>

They are definitely not empty anymore. They become the opposite of empty, they are full, they are complete. The feelings and emotions overflow from them, leaking into their surrounding, shining the space like rising Sun on the sky. Bright and brilliant, blinding and dazzling.

The Shadow materializes itself behind them, covering its eyes, pained by the rainbow and sunshine, deafened by the exploding sound of tears dropping and hearts beating. It grimaces and twitches, dying, in their presence. "What have you done!" it growls and struggles.

Dean looks at it, grinning. "Nothing, just some natural, healthy expression of feelings." He exchanges a knowing, meaningful look with Cas, their hands still holding together.

That's when Cas realizes it. "You can't bear it. The love and happiness, our feelings fill the Empty so full that they're tearing it apart."

In the Shadow's glare, a cracking opens by their feet.

They jump in without a second thought, hands held, eyes locked, hearts full. Leaving the Empty behind.
