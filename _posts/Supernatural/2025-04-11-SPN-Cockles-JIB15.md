### Misha solo panel

> **Fan:** (yelling something)
>
> **Misha:** I'm sorry, talk to Jensen about that.

Curiosity is killing me to know what exactly is that yelling about that makes him lower his eyes, lick his lips, and smile so sheepishly.

**About That "Full Penetration" talk**

> **Misha:** I, I, I, I love the idea of me -- of somebody resurrecting Supernatural, and you know, and, and of course, of course Eric Kripke would have to be at the helm of that but then I'm afraid like, I'm afraid that, you know, he would make Castiel's penis explode or something like that.
>
> **Misha:** Now that he's not you know restricted by standards and practices at the CW, what is he going to do. Is it like -- (chuckle) He's like "So you're going to love this, guys. We're actually going to have -- We're going to show, Cas and Dean with full penetration. What do you think?" (fake panic) And Jensen be like "Yeah!" And I'm like "Nah." (touch ear) Oops.

(Transcribing down the stumbles as well as the fully constructed sentence because the stumbles and pauses and hesitations and sentence reconstruction sometimes can also be quite telltaling. And the fillings like "you know"s and "of course"s.)

The context and train of thoughts of that talk is also worth noting, that quite apparently the very first question in the panel leads to a heavy aftertaste of "The Boys" vibe the whole panel. So my theory is, it's more like a secret hint of his character in "The Boys" than an imagination of destiel.

Been thinking, if this is really coming out of nowhere, just him making up a pretend conversation, the tense in the sentences isn't quite right. He said "EK *would have* to be..." and "he *would* make Cas's..." The subjunctive sentences, for made-up things. So the second part should be "He would be like... Jensen would be like... I'd be like..."

But no, the second part is in simple present tense, "He's like... Jensen be like... I'm like..." For sure can't use the past tense if that's a real conversation, but making it simple present tense, that's vague enough and easy enough to pretend. AND, when saying that, Misha looked at the floor, eyeball moving toward the right bottom direction, the expression of recalling instead of making up new things.

So my headcanon is, this is a real hidden implication of "The Boys", and it quite likely has been a real or close-to-real conversation. Not between Cas and Dean though, more likely be his and Jensen's characters. And, by correcting "we're actually going to have" to "we're going to show", where the word "show" could mean any different visual way of displaying something on screen, would guess there might be a sneaky image of their characters with some highly sexually involved entangled posture included in "The Boys". Hopefully.

> **Fan:** On a scale from Jensen's bare butt to Rob's bare everything, how internet-breaking do you expect your role on "The Boys" to be?
>
> **Misha:** (laugh, turn to his back) I have to admit that going into "The Boys" I did have a bit of trepidation cuz we talked about me being on "The Boys" before I saw what it was that Eric wanted me to do. And I was kind of imagining like you know, Eric would give me a character who, uh, choked to death on his own penis, or something like that. I was thinking like "Oh my god, can anything be as bad as what happened to Rob?"
>
> **Misha:** But I'm not gonna spoil things for you but em, Rob might still take the cake. I mean, it was pretty impressive. I laughed when I -- I told this to Eric but I was like "You know, Eric, it's funny like you really helped boost Rob's career, you wrote him into Supernatural, you made him into God on Supernatural, and you gave him a ton of work there but also you know a lot of exposure in a really cool role, and then you're like, 'And now I'm going to destroy you, and I'm going to make you eat your own ass on national television -- international television.'"
>
> **Misha:** I wish there had been video footage of Rob when he's like... (the epic performance of Rob's script-reading experience)

Laughed so hard on "the scale from Jensen's bare butt to Rob's bare everything", honestly, that is indeed a very well scale for "The Boys". And now we have the measurement: more to the Jensen's bare butt than Rob's bare everything.

The script-reading experience is so hilarious and amazing. Kinda reminds me of the improv performance experience. Very improv, very vivid, the expressions and dialogues and pretending the items and Ruth (!) being there, it's such a good comedy performance. Very confidently speaking, he'd definitely be an amazing improv actor if he chooses to be.

> **Misha (in Cas's voice):** I really don't sound like Castiel.

speaking in Cas's voice at [12:15](https://youtu.be/YVqN3GFTqXU?t=735) of the video, low and gravelly. indeed miss Cas so much now

> **Fan:** If all main actors of Supernatural were on the plane that was about to crush and you had a parachute to save one of the actors, who would it be?

The question at [14:39](https://youtu.be/YVqN3GFTqXU?t=879) of the video

There would be so many witty ways to defuse the question, the first thing I think he could say is "That must be a damn big plane" and then goes on talking about how many actors there are and distract the question into praising the fellow actors.

The second thing is to chew the keyword "main actors", like, "Why, there are so many brilliant minor characters that are also super talented and impressive, they deserve to be on the plane too", then goes on talking about and praising the impressive guest stars.

And, the very easiest answer would be, "I'll save the captain."

But that real-life terrifying jet almost-crash story is also a good one.

> **Fan:** (recommend three masterpiece movies)
>
> **Misha:** (Matrix 1, The Man Who Knew Too Little) For some reason this movie that I haven't seen in a long time by Jim Jarmusch, Down by Law. Does anyone know that movie? It's great little like weird-- Roberto Benigni is the star of it and it's a fucking great movie from like 25 years ago.
>
> **Misha:** But picking three movies is totally unfair, there are so many-- I mean, I just watched Beverly Hills Cops, I was like, this is a masterpiece, this is an amazing film. It was-- Yeah I almost revealed a big spoiler from "The Boys" just now. You almost got me.

For the record, *Down by Law* is 1986, that's 40 years ago, so if it feels like 25 years ago, now we know the mental current time is around 2010, about the time to newly join the Supernatural. Back from future, baby, pretty sure had read a ton of time travel stories like that.

Also, pretty sure the "just watched" movie is very likely watched on set around the time of shooting "The Boys", even for character study. If that can reveal the big spoiler for "The Boys", looks like it's time to watch it to get a feeling.

> **Misha:** Have you seen-- Here's another good one that I think was a-- that had a pretty big impact on me as a young person: Debbie Does Dallas?

It is not my fault that my cockles detector kicks in immediately at the mention of "Debbie Does Dallas". After all, I was reading cockles breakup theory just several nights ago, and there was all these awfully sad gifs of him mentioning "Debbie Does Dallas" 14 years ago. Considering Jensen is from Dallas, the porno has cowboys and cheerleaders, and Jensen was a cheerleader in high school and a fetish of cowboys. It is too difficult to ignore the purposeful mention.

It is my headcanon now that this has become an inside joke between Misha and Jensen, say, like a bet: if Misha can manage to squeeze it into interview or panel or whatever during the day, he can get rewarded at the night when they get together (something intimate, you know, *wink*).

(Now there is no brake on my cockles shipping head)

End of the [solo panel](https://youtu.be/Cr0P2D6d9HA?t=163), when Jensen comes, Misha's eyes hardly leave him the moment they land on him. Then there is the tight, sweet hug, chin on the shoulder, eyes closed, breathing him in. Aw, too sweet.

And when it's the turn to hug Jared, as always, Jensen's eyes, god, man, you can be less possessive over your boyfriend for a second, maybe? Or you can eat Jared alive, that's an option too. Careful, don't swallow the gum when you stare.

And Jensen's shout out for Misha when he leaves the stage is so sweet too,  just can't let him go without huge applause.

Seriously, this is meme level gesture from Misha lol.

"When someone says nothing is perfect", Misha is here to present: Jensen is.

<br><br>

20 seconds in, and they're already eye-fucking. Awesome.

The lady courtesy gestures are soooo adorable from both of them. And when it's Misha doing that, Jensen's eyes sweep him up and down, follow his fingers, brush on the hip, tongue licking the lips. Jensen, you really aren't very subtle, you know.

<br><br>

From 1:01 to 1:07, it takes exactly 6 seconds, for Misha to automatically move from a social distance to be right by Jensen's side, inside personal space.

What's personal space? No, never heard of it, between the two of them.

They're just like two big human-shaped magnets, regardless of whether there are other people in between (like in the opening), or the positions of the seats are fixed, they just can't move toward each other, can they?

<br><br>
![](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3b4c38842eb20f0a35d0423dead045ca/d9d525480c657c43-78/s2048x3072/2529f8751a9de5cb5602f411f17ef2ea229b276d.jpg)

By each tiniest unconscious swing, they just stand closer and closer.

Pretty sure that's what the chairs are for, pin them to the fixed-distance place, or else they'd probably start touching.

And look at the hands, Misha keeps his hand tucked in the elbow, Jensen's in the pocket. Why? Afraid if they're not confined, the hands would have their own minds and start putting on each other's shoulder or arm or thigh?

<br><br>

For two times, before sitting down, the automatic adjustment to the seats that Misha has to do, is to pull it closer to Jensen. But it still feels too far away, doesn't it? Maybe thigh-to-thigh would feel even better?

<br><br>

Jensen is saying "he was in a really really uncomfortable position and it was entertaining", that is when Misha starts licking and biting his bottom lips. Is it nervous, or flirtatious? don't think had seen them has so many lip-biting and licking so frequently when they're in their own panel or other panels, so pretty sure that's something they do when they're around each other. So yeah, flirting it is.

Flirting when the other is talking about "uncomfortable position", and down the line there is "had to relax, open up, slide in", "it's hard, and hard for a long time", "just ride it", then yeah no way it's not sexual.

<br><br>

Love how they are just too familiar with each other that many times full sentence isn't needed.

Jensen just needs to go "Where's the..." and wave the arms and Misha knows he's talking about the button and the spin.

And when pouring the drinks, that quiet conversation, Misha: "Apple juice?" Jensen: "Yeah."

Too easy and comfortable, always know what the other is thinking, what they want for a drink. Always so much understanding.

> **Jensen:** I still get nervous. It's probably more the pressure I put on myself about certain moments or certain scenes or certain actors that I might be working with or something where I'm like okay, this is a high pressure situation.

When he says "certain actors", eyes locked with Misha, hands and body turn to him, yeah yeah we all get it, not just any *certain* actor, it's Misha you're thinking.

So that is saying, growing up shooting commercials and soap operas and shows and TVs, he's used to the cameras and lights and not getting nervous most times. Except when acting with your boyfriend. That's when you get all shaky and astonished and stunned, aren't you? That's why the "front-row seat watching my best friend pulling an Emmy award performance" and stay stoic. wondering just how many more ways can you think of to praise your boyfriend's fascinating performance? Countless?

<br><br>

When it's Misha's turn to answer something, all that Jensen can do is stare at his lips, thinking nothing (but to kiss those talkative lips?). The same stoic expression when watching him act, falling to the default. doubt he's even really processing the words properly, because we know, as proof from the video timing, that the reaction time is about or above ten seconds.

Misha is talking about his very first performing experience on a real set, hitting on Winona Ryder. And it takes exactly ten seconds from 11:01 to 11:11, from Misha first mentions the film is "Girl, Interrupted", to Jensen grabs the microphone asking "You were in 'Girl, Interrupted'?" while Misha is already starting telling the story.

Ten seconds, to register some information that is not even bombing, just a little surprise.

Guess that totally explains why when Cas says "I love you", Dean can't react. Darkness arrives within one second. He needs at least ten to process.

<br><br>

And, now that we know Misha is in "Girl, Interrupted", and with all the big name actresses and ladies and girls in that film, think it's a must to watch now.

How did he get such a job with so many beautiful ladies? Because he's just as beautiful.

When Misha is telling the story with the experience in "Girl, Interrupted", the story with Angelina Jolie, what is Jensen doing?

Unsurprisingly, biting the bottom lips (read: flirting), already start laughing like a fool when the story hasn't started getting to the funny part yet. He's literally laughing to tears already, cracking in the joke, having to wipe the eyes and all that. Yeah, totally normal for lovers.

> **Jensen:** Dean was stoic because Jensen was -- (...) so Jensen turned into an audience member in that scene and forgot to act. And so I defaulted to just stoicism. (...)

have a feeling this is not the first time Jensen refers to himself as a third person view when answering questions regarding the confession scene. Even if the hand gesture is pointing to his own chest when saying that sentence, and in between the sentences that are first person view reference ("I think... I was watching him... I defaulted to...") But it is still interesting to see the two times of using the third person reference.

Almost like he tries to put into some distance between himself with the person who acted Dean at that time, as if he's answering questions for a different guy, so that he can be emotionally remote, and bypass many questions, because, if he's not that guy, he wouldn't know what that guy was thinking. In other words, put in distance between himself and Dean.

So easily, audience and fans would forget actors are not characters, but he, especially when answering for the most important scene's interpretation question, he is trying to not overstep for the character. He brings Dean to life, then he gives Dean freedom to let Dean be Dean without him. It is noble.

(In that sense, maybe it would be a good thing too if Misha can do something similar, put in some distance with Cas? Not overtake Cas's mouth and voice?)

<br><br>

> **Jensen:** (...) that was all part of the bond that we all shared, and it was part of love we all shared. (...)

All the bonds, all the love. Their bonds are their love. Dean and Cas have profound bonds, and they are in love. The casts and crew have bonds, Jensen and Misha have bonds, there are also so much love they shared.

> (First, long paragraphs of Jensen praising Misha's performance in the confession scene, then they steer to Dean's farewell barn scene)
>
> **Misha:** You did a fucking great job on that scene. You really just made that so beautifully.
>
> **Jensen:** That was cuz I witnessed your performance.

Jensen gives his all in on his farewell and "I love you", because of Misha's confession and farewell.

That gives me a new perspective that I didn't think of before. In that exact same sense, Dean would say "I love you" at the last breath, would be exactly because of Cas. He wouldn't if Cas didn't. Now he does, because... is it because he has played it too many times in his head to say it back to Cas in the last five years, thinking that's what he'd finally be able to say out loud if only Cas comes back again, only to running into his own death, and for the very last chance to use these words, that's why he chooses to say them now.

Still makes me so sad and can still see so much love.

### The Opening Ceremony

The cake in the opening ceremony, barely anyone touches it. But Misha tastes a fingerful, so does Rob.

Guess that explains the father-son of Cas and Chuck lol, they're truly similar enough or something.
