Summary: It's a story of how Charlie Bradbury gets her "Princess Leia in a slave bikini straddling a twenty-sided die" tattoo.

Charlie regrets her costume the minute she walks into the Comic-Con hall.

Man, she should have known. She curses under her breath for her own stupidity. 2005 is *THE* year of Star Wars, *Revenge of the Sith* hasn't been out in theaters for more than two months. The thirty-year-long story finally has a completion. Of course San Diego Comic-Con is going to be crowded with astonishingly fascinating Star Wars cosplayers.

She really should have brought her Padmé combat suit or something along those lines -- that white costume has taken her almost a month to piece together everything herself (tight enough to fit her well while still nimble enough to move around isn't an easy job), let alone that 3D-printed blaster gun (God knows how many wasted prototypes were dumped before one finally looked and felt right). She wore it when she was at the Japanese Star Wars Celebration last year -- that's why she thought she'd go for a change at SDCC.

Instead, she's wandering around the display hall as a giant walking-talking twenty-sided die. (It felt fun when she was at home!)

So, yes, Charlie has to admit, if in her twenty years of life there is one thing she regrets, it's this moment.

But still, thinking on the brighter side, she still gets to enjoy the view. With all the Jedi and Sith and troopers and creatures hanging out around her, she wouldn't know if she's still on Earth or the whole place has been magically transferred to Coruscant.

She gets to really enjoy the immersion.

The night bar is even better.

The host obviously knows better than her. As soon as the special menu shows a blue, sparkling, suspiciously alien-juice-looking cocktail, and the music plays the ultimate classic tune from Jabba the Hutt's palace, she knows she's going to stay here -- in the amazing fantasy land of Star Wars -- for most of the night.

She eyes the drink menu, feeling so tempted to try every single one of them -- how can you decide between drinks with names like "The Outer Rim" and "Jedi Mind Trick"? Or "Fuzzy Tauntaun"? Even that "Jabba Juice" doesn't sound half bad, considering where the bar vibe comes from.

She orders a "Blue Bantha" to start with -- the one on today's special. She'll order a couple more before the night ends, she tells herself. (As the night turns out, that promise has indeed been kept quite well.)

Honestly, the drink isn't as mind-blowing as the whole vibe with the music and decoration and lighting, and all the alien-costumed customers in here -- that would have been too high an expectation anyway. The drink tastes a little bit too much rum, and the mixed sugar and juice try too hard to compensate. But what can you expect from a drink named after a big, furry Tatooine creature? Really, there isn't much to complain about. It's too much fun however it tastes.

Charlie sips her drink cheerfully, eyeing around her with all the curiosity to see what people are wearing and ordering.

The alcohol slides down her throat with a fresh, bubbling chill, mixed with an equal amount of bitterness and sweetness. The flavor is actually getting better after half the glass.

There is a group of Jedi sitting at the far end of the bar, with their blue and green plastic lightsabers leaning around the counter, laughing loudly. A smaller group of Sith sit right next to them. Charlie can already spot two impressive Darth Mauls in the group, with all the facial decorations and paint, even those pointed pieces on their heads. She wonders curiously why they haven't started a fight yet -- even a fake one.

This is so much more fun than a DnD session she thought she'd be getting into before coming to the convention. She smiles to herself, continuing to sip her drink mindlessly.

"Would there be any reward if I rolled a twenty on you, Miss Die?" a young girl's voice talks to her close by.

Charlie almost feels like she's snapped out of a dazed dream, looking up startled.

Princess Leia in her slave bikini runs straight into her eyes -- not Princess Leia for real, of course, Charlie has to remind herself, but the next best thing -- a lean and cute coser who looks as amazing as Carrie Fisher in that suit. She really has to pull all her remaining self-control after that drink's damnation not to stare at the thin cloth barely covering her center and lower body. She doesn't want to be rude.

Charlie blinks hard, swallowing, forcing her eyes to pointedly stay on her face -- she looks just about her age, twenty or so. And that small smile on her face, that earnest look in her eyes, oh god, she can already feel her cheeks burning -- is that drink really so strong?

"Your Highness," Charlie can't help smiling back, trying to bend her upper body slightly to do a courtesy bow, but the twenty-sided die isn't exactly allowing that. That's when she finally realizes what the girl is referring to.

"Oh --" She glances at her own costume. "Yes, of course. What would you like?" She winks at the girl, pulling out her best hitting skills.

But thinking better, she adds, "Anything but my collector's edition Princess Leia Funko Pop. You have no idea how much effort I put in to find that one."

The girl laughs wide, as if Charlie just told the funniest joke in the world. She says, "I have something better to offer."

"I'm all ears." Charlie gestures to the seat next to her. "Why don't Your Worshipfulness have a seat here and allow me to buy you a drink first?"

She doesn't wait for an answer before waving at the bartender and ordering a "Jedi Mind Trick" for her.

The girl leans by the counter, not really sitting down, but the distance between the two of them is even closer than it would have been. She has a pair of light brown eyes, Charlie realizes, drunk in those eyes -- definitely more drunk than that one drink is capable.

"Are you trying to 'Obi-wan' me, Dear Die?" She takes the drink with a laugh. The glints in her eyes are even brighter, reflecting the colorful, electrical lights in the bar.

"It's Charlie," Charlie tells her, feeling her throat too dry now. She orders something on the menu for herself, not even really looking at where her fingers are pointing. The drink arrives green, with a fresh smell of mint and lime.

"Nice choice," the girl's eyes follow her movement as she brings the glass to her lips, then linger overtly on her lips. "If you like salted tequila, that is. 'The Outer Rim' is very Tatooine."

Charlie takes a gulp, feeling her head more lighted by the second, seeing nothing but the girl's wandering eyes -- and oh, the large expense of tender, warm, bare skin revealed by that unbelievably beautiful, golden slave bikini. She knows how Anakin feels by the lake when standing beside Padmé and touching her bare skin ever so gently. Why are they still sitting here?

"I bought you a drink, Princess," she hears herself saying, almost pouting. "At least I can find out Your Highness's name?"

The girl leans in, a mixed fragrance of peach and vodka brushing against her cheek, teasing her nose. Charlie indulges in the sweet smell gleefully. The girl whispers in her ear: "Leia."

Charlie widens her eyes. "Wait, seriously? It can't be -- is it really --?"

The girl bursts into a huge laugh, her eyes twinkling, her whole body trembling with laughter, head tilted back, laughing so hard Charlie thinks she might even tumble and fall. Her hands reach out to lay on her waist before her brain registers -- just to help her stand steady, she reasons to herself. But her traitorous hands do not move away even after the "Princess Leia" eases her laugh.

"No, it's Kara, actually." She wipes tears from the corners of her eyes from laughing so hard. "You should look at your face." She's still giggling.

Charlie can't stop the corners of her mouth from lifting wide just from watching her laugh. She wants that laugh to never stop.

"You got me. That's a real good one, Princess Kara," Charlie says, not realizing her hands are still on Kara and slightly pulling in until she's practically standing right between her legs. The thin golden costume shifts slightly as she moves, leaving gaps and openings here and there, in places no one should see. At least, now, at this moment, maybe ten minutes after talking to her -- or maybe it's already an hour, she's long lost track of or any sense of time -- her brain starts whispering she wants to cover her up so she's the only lucky one gets to witness and devour this view of her.

Kara raises an eyebrow, amused. "Still calling me Princess?"

"Of course. Always, Sweetheart," Charlie answers, her eyes dropping to her lips, then flicking swiftly back to her eyes, silently asking.

Kara blinks rapidly, leaning down. Her hands land in Charlie's hair, her lips on hers.

The "Jedi Mind Trick" is definitely made of peach and vodka. Charlie thinks, she can taste every bit of flavor from her tongue, as she's sure she can just taste that "Outer Rim" on hers.

She closes her eyes, holding her tighter, wanting to feel her body and warmth -- only to find she can't. That annoying twenty-sided die costume is stupidly blocking the way, the bulk in front of her is just separating them too far away.

"My hotel, your Highness?" Charlie asks breathlessly between kisses.

Kara doesn't even bother breaking the kiss to rush an eager nod, her tongue still tangled with Charlie's.

She has no idea how they get to the hotel without tripping over each other.

<br>

"Wait, wait, don't take that off yet. I love it."

They throw themselves onto the memory foam bed -- Charlie finally manages to get rid of that die, lying on the bed in only her lingerie. Kara is reaching behind herself, trying to undo her Slave Leia bikini.

"I didn't know you love it so much." Kara stops midway, crawling onto the bed on her knees with the costumes on.

Charlie lifts her upper body, admiring the view. "Are you kidding me? This is world-class, award-winning level of sexy and beauty."

Kara narrows her eyes. "Oh, so it's the costume you are falling in love with? I'll make sure to leave it in your closet then, when I leave tomorrow."

Charlie laughs, reaching to caress the bare skin of her arms with her palms. "Yet you are still thinking about staying the night." She smirks.

Kara stares at her, with a pretend glare. "God, I should've known you'd be annoying. Did I just lose a persuasion roll?"

"No, I think that's a charisma roll -- and girl, you nailed it, twenty-twenty big success in charming me," Charlie tells her brightly, pulling her closer.

Kara straddles her, the golden piece of cloth covering her lower body dangling against Charlie's chest. She lowers herself, almost lying on top of her but not quite, using her elbows for support. Their lips meet again and don't part for a long time.

Charlie's hands follow the line of the golden thread from behind Kara's neck, across her shoulder, and to the front. Thin metal threads sewn together with silk and materials Charlie doesn't quite know she would need a Ph.D. to even name them.

Kara's chest rises and falls under her touch. She watches her move under her long flickering eyelashes.

"You made all these by yourself? They're astounding! I mean, how did you even find those materials? So light and beautiful and not too hard to hurt the skin? How to even possibly knit them together and make sure they fit?" She can't stop staring.

Kara laughs proudly. "I can show you one day. But are we here talking about costume-making or making out?"

Charlie's fingers instantly reach backward to where the knots are and start working on undoing them. "You're right. My mistake."

As much as she enjoys those clothes, she enjoys the body and skin behind them, and the brain and soul underneath them so much more.

It's an unbelievably wonderful night. A fantasy coming true. The best she's ever known, and the best she thinks she'll ever get.

So amazing and sweet, and mind-blowingly hot. And with absolutely everything she'd ever want. So perfect that, by morning, when the birds start singing outside the window, Charlie doesn't quite want to open her eyes.

The drinks from last night are still rendering her brain heavy -- or maybe it's something else. A night of dreams and fantasy so incredible that she'd never think she'll have for real. She doesn't want to open her eyes to face the reality and find out it was just a dream yet. A dream where she's frantically in love with *Princess Leia* and making out with her in the slave suit. The fantasy she always had whenever she watched *Return of the Jedi*.

She licks her lips, slowly letting out a contented sigh, and opens her eyes.

The girl from last night looks straight into her eyes with a sweet smile. "Morning, Sunshine."

"You're real," Charlie beams at her. "Kara." She whispers her name, reminding herself she's not Princess Leia, but a thousand times better.

"I love you." Charlie looks her in the eyes, telling her.

"I know," Kara answers with a brighter smile.

Of course, that's the only correct answer, all things considered.

"I'd better get going now." Kara sits up, moving around to start looking for her clothes.

The Slave Leia costume was left on the chair by the bed last night, casually, from the look of that, but at least careful enough not to ruin any part. She starts tying the threads.

Charlie slowly lifts herself up, watching her. Her smile fades slowly into disappointment she can't hide no matter how hard she tries. "That's it?" she asks, a little hurt. Even though she knows she probably shouldn't. They only just met in a bar at Comic-Con yesterday. And most of the time they were both at least a little drunk. An amazing one-night stand is all she should have known to expect, instead of, say, thinking she's found the love of her life.

Kara stops her movements, leaning back in to kiss her on the lips, soothing away the crinkle starting to form between her eyebrows.

"I'd like to think it was fate leading us to run into each other last night," she tells Charlie. "Why don't we let fate decide again what our future will be?"

Charlie wants to argue, but Kara is already reaching for a die -- a die to a DnD player is just like a purse to everyone, you never run out of those. This one, in particular, is Charlie's lucky die she happened to leave on the nightstand before heading for the Comic-Con yesterday.

"How about a ten-twenty roll? We'll have half the chance. Success, and I'll give you my number. Alright?" Kara holds her gaze with Charlie -- who stares at the die so hard, willing for it to obey, wishing never stronger that she'd known the Jedi way of mastering the Force so she could just silently change it to what she wants like Qui-Gon did for that die of Watto's to free young Anakin. Kara kisses the die once, and rolls it onto the nightstand.

It's a nine.

Charlie thinks the whole world is a shade greyer just that moment. "Come on, it's close enough," she pleads.

"You know the one and only DnD rule," Kara smiles weakly, looking just as disappointed.

"Never cheat. The die is the fate," she murmurs, defeated.

Kara leans in to give her a pecking kiss on the forehead, one last time. A farewell. "You never know, maybe we'll run into each other again. What does your heart tell you?"

Charlie tries hard to pull a smile again, meeting her light brown eyes. "I hope so. Yes... I guess. I'd really like to see you again."

"Then I'm sure we will," she says, leaving the room with a wave of her hand. "Goodbye, Charlie."

Charlie leans back against the headboard, staring at that "Nine" miserably.

<br>

She goes to the Comic-Con again, that day and the next.

There are many Leias, but none of them are Kara.

On the last day, there is a tattoo stand in the convention center. The artist can draw anything, however wild your imagination goes.

Charlie watches her working for a while, and walks up to wait in line.

She asks her to paint a "Princess Leia in a slave bikini straddling a twenty-sided die" on her right shoulder. The artist smiles gently, with minor amusement -- that's probably not even the most hilarious request she heard that day. Charlie returns with a small tilted tip of her lips -- the closest to a smile she can manage now.

She's in her casual clothes today, the die costume packed away in her suitcase, so no one can possibly understand the reference. No one ever will, if she doesn't start talking about her.

Not even Dean.

What's the point, if she's never going to run into her again? But at least, she doesn't want to forget that's something she had, something she could have had, something tied to a die and a choice from fate.

"All tattoos are cool," Dean says, several hours after they first meet, when she's on her way to a 007 mission.

Charlie swallows. "Mine is Princess Leia in a slave bikini straddling a twenty-sided die."

Dean huffs a silent laugh, amused. "We've all been there."

Charlie feels a need to explain: "I was drunk. It was Comic-Con."

Except, that's not true. Not entirely.

It was Comic-Con. But she wasn't drunk when she decided to get that tattoo.

The tattoo artist asked her if she was sure about that. Washing a tattoo away could be troublesome. And she said yes.

She watched the lines and colors being added to her skin, the beautiful Princess emerging on her shoulder, in the dazzling golden threaded slave bikini. Her braided hair flowed behind her. She straddled the die like riding a horse, with the cutest, sweetest smile on the tip of her lips.

It was even better than she imagined.

It didn't look like Princess Leia. It looked like Kara.

Charlie felt her heart clench, squeezing her breathless.

She remembered that mixed bittersweetness from vodka and tequila and peach and salt in those kisses, coming back in her mouth, haunting the tip of her tongue.

She showed the artist that doomed die for reference, and made sure she painted the "Twenty" on the very top.

<br>

Charlie has been to way too many Star Wars themed conventions and activities and cruises and fan gatherings, and all the other big and small Comic-Cons she can manage to attend, if time and money allow, between working at Richard Roman Enterprises.

Everyone around her thinks she's obsessed with Star Wars -- which isn't entirely wrong. She still enjoys the movies and new shows every now and then.

But she stops rewatching *Return of the Jedi*. When she has to watch with friends, she'd find excuses to skip the first forty minutes. The scenes with slave Leia, Charlie finds herself always so unbelievably easy to be turned on and then immediately sensing a taste of bitterness around a hole in her heart she doesn't quite want to handle or know how to.

She never finds anyone named Kara, however hard she scours the Internet -- she could crack the Pentagon at twelve, but she just can't find a person she's looking for. Sometimes she thinks her skills with computers are just not as good as she'd hope they'd be.

She still keeps that die -- so that in the middle of quiet nights, lying on bed sleepless, rolling and turning, feeling the other side of the bed is just too big, too empty, missing someone that should have been there -- she can stare at the die, thinking for the thousandth time: What would her life be like, if the die rolled a "Ten" that day?

Little does she know, in a different world, an alternate world, Kara becomes a bakery owner, and she's still a programmer. She gets to live with her together -- the love of her life. And then the Apocalypse happens, and she has to watch her die.

And in that world, she'd wonder: if that day, the die gave them a "Nine," if it would hurt less; if her heart wouldn't break to pieces, she wouldn't have to watch blood gushing out of her wounds, saying her name and "I love you" for the last time, and light going out in her eyes; if it would be easier, to never have it at all, than to have it and lose it all.

She doesn't have an answer.

There is no answer.

**After work notes:**

(The Star Wars-themed bar and drink description comes from my experience at [Oga's Cantina](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/hollywood-studios/ogas-cantina/menus/dinner/) in Disney World Orlando. It was mind-blowing, everyone interested in an immersive experience should have a try there.)

I was just rewatching *Return of the Jedi* for God knows how many times, and my brain started overlaying the scene with Charlie's words about her tattoo being "Princess Leia in a slave bikini straddling a twenty-sided die."

So I searched it, and found [a beautiful piece of art on Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/jam-of-time/748393402318700544) that shows perfectly what the tattoo looks like, just as I imagined. Love it so much.

And I started thinking, what if that's not just a funny, joking thing? What if there are actual meanings behind that? The word "straddle" sounds purposeful enough. What if both the Princess and the die are actually referring to people -- Charlie and someone she met and didn't want to forget? And it's in a Comic-Con, both could fit perfectly into the situation, easy to be cosplayers' costumes. Hence the start setting of the story.

And then I asked myself: If she had met someone unforgettable enough to tattoo their reference on her, why doesn't she now, when we meet her in S07E20? Then I remembered the Apocalypse world version of Charlie did have a love of her life, Kara, a bakery owner, and they lived happily together, then she died when the Apocalypse started. I immediately knew this girl she meets, in this world, is also Kara -- a different encounter, a different development, a different ending.

Probably no one's gonna believe now this story was originally planned to be a one-shot fluff PWP with explicit scenes, then it gradually reduced from explicit level to barely mature, then the Porn-Without-Plot became Plot-Without-Porn. The whole thing turned into a canon-compliant plot, fluff turned to angst and pining and pain and a miserable, lonely life. I swear it wasn't the initial plan. But guess that's just something I'm good at. Sorry about the pain.

As for the ending, I'm also thinking, it might just be another example of what's in this post and always hit me super hard however many times I read: [NorthernSparrow's Tumblr post](https://www.tumblr.com/northern-sparrow/178684831602). What if the world you are in now -- the one without the love of your life, the one where you live alone and grow old alone -- is actually one that the love of your life from a different world bargained for? For you to have a better life, a longer life, even if it's a world and a life without her. In that other world, you'd both be there, together, but there was an Apocalypse, or maybe you were dying, or the world was ending. And somehow, the love of your life found a way to switch you into this world, and they pushed the button. So maybe, this normal, peaceful, no-Apocalypse world, is at the cost of losing her entire existence. Just like Apocalypse World Charlie and her Kara, and our Charlie but alone.

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">One last thing, a little confession: It is watching slave Leia and starting to fantasize about her that made me start thinking I might not be straight. And the fantasies with Charlie confirmed it. So I think, it's a must to write something for them as a tribute of some kind, considering the number of fantasies they've given me. And what's better than putting them together (though not exactly)? Thank you for the enlightenment on my sexuality, ladies. Always love you, both of you. Always welcome you in my dreams.</p>
