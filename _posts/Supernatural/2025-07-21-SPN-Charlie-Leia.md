Charlie regrets her costume the minute she walks into the comic-con.

Man, she should have known. She curses under her breath for her own stupidity. 2005 is *THE* year of Star Wars, *Revenge of the Sith* hasn't been out in the theaters for more than two months. The thirty-year long story finally has a completion. Of course San Diego Comic-Con is going to be crowded with astonishingly fascinating Star Wars cosplayers.

She really should have brought her Padme combat suit or something -- that white costume has cost her almost a month to piece together everything herself (tight enough to fit her well while still nimble enough to move around isn't an easy job), let alone that 3D-printed blaster gun (God knows how many wasted prototypes were dumped before one finally looks and feels right). Instead, she's wandering around the display hall as a giant walking-talking 20-sided die. (It feels fun when she's at home!)

So, yes, Charlie has to admit, if in her 20 years of life there is one thing she regrets, it's this moment.

But still, thinking on the brighter side, she still gets to enjoy the view. With all the Jedi and Sith and troopers and creatures hanging out around her, she wouldn't know if she's still on Earth or the whole place has been magically transferred to Coruscant.

The night bar is even better.

The host obviously knows better than her. As soon as the special menu shows a blue sparkling suspiciously alien-juice-looking cocktail, and the music plays the ultimate classic one from Jabba the Hutt's palace, she knows she's going to stay here, in the amazing fantasy land of Star Wars for the most of the night.

She eyes the drink menu, feeling so tempted to try every single one of them -- how can you decide between drinks with names like "The Outer Rim" and "Jedi Mind Trick"? Or "Fuzzy Tauntaun"? Even that "Jabba Juice" doesn't sound half bad, considering where the bar vibe comes from.

She orders "Blue Bantha" to start with -- the one on today's special. She'll order a couple more before the night ends, she tells herself. (As the night turns out, that promise has indeed been kept quite well.)

Honestly, the drink isn't as mind-blowing as the whole vibe with the music and settings and lightings, and all the alien-costumed customers in here -- that would have been too high an expectation anyway -- A little bit too much rum, and the mixed sugar and juice tries too hard to compensate. But what can you expect from a drink with a name from a big furry Tatooine creature? Really, there isn't much to complain.

Charlie sips her drink cheerfully, eyeing around her with all the curiosity to see what people are wearing and ordering.

The alcohol slides down the throat with fresh, bubbling chillness, mixed with equal amount of bitterness and sweetness. The flavor is actually getting better after half the glass.

There is a group of Jedi sitting at the far end of the bar, with their blue and green plastic lightsabers leaning around the counter, laughing loudly. A smaller group of Sith sit right next to them. Charlie can already spot two impressive Darth Maul's in the group, with all the facial decorations and paintings, even those pointed pieces on their heads. She wonders curiously why they haven't started a fight yet -- even a fake one.

This is so much more fun than a DnD session she thought she's gonna get into before coming to the convention. She smiles to herself, continuing sipping her drink mindlessly.

"Would there be any reward, if I roll a twenty on you?" A young girl's voice talks to her close by.

Charlie almost feels like she's snapped out of a dazed dream, looking up startled.

Princess Leia in her slave bikini runs straight into her eyes -- not Princess Leia for real, of course, Charlie has to remind herself, an astonishingly cute coser that looks as amazing as Carrie Fisher in that suit. She really has to pull all her remaining self-control after that drink's damnation to not staring at the thin clothe barely covering her center and lower body.

Charlie blinks hard, swallowing, forcing her eyes pointedly stay on her face -- she looks just about her age, twenty or so. And that small smile on her face, and that earnest look in her eyes, oh god, she can already feel her cheeks burning -- is that drink really so strong?

"Your Highness," Charlie can't help smiling back, trying to bend her upper body slightly to do a courtesy bow, but the 20-sided die isn't exactly allowing that. That's when she finally realizes what the girl is referring to.

"Oh --" She glances at her own costume. "Yes, of course. What would you like?" She winks at the girl, pulling her best hitting strength.

But thinking better, she adds, "Anything but my collector's edition of Princess Leia Funko Pop. You have no idea how much effort I put to find that one."

The girl laughs wide, as if she just told the funniest joke in the world. She says, "I have something better to offer."

"I'm all ears." Charlie gestures the seat next to her, "Why don't you sit down and let me buy you a drink first?"

She doesn't wait for an answer before waving at the bartender and ordering a "Jedi Mind Trick" for her.

The girl leans by the counter, not really sitting down, but the distance between the two of them is even closer than it would have been. She has a pair of light brown eyes, Charlie realizes, drunk in those eyes -- definitely more drunk that that one drink is capable.

"Are you trying to 'Obi-wan' me, dear die?" She takes the drink with a laugh. The glints in her eyes are even brighter, reflecting the colorful, electrical lights in the bar.

"It's Charlie," Charlie tells her, feeling her throat too dry now. She orders something on the menu, not even really looking where her fingers are pointing. The drink arrives green, with a fresh smell of mint and lime.

"Nice choice," the girl's eyes follow her move of moving the glass to her lips, then linger on her lips, "if you like salted tequila, that is. 'The Outer Rim' is very Tatooine."

Charlie tastes a gulp, feeling her head more lighted by each moment, seeing nothing but the girl's wandering eyes, and oh, the large opening of the bare skin around those unbelievably beautiful, golden slave bikini. Why are they still sitting here?

"I bought you a drink, Princess," she hears herself saying, almost pouting, "at least I can find out your Highness's name?"

The girl leans in, a mixed fragrance of grapefruit and vodka huffing by her cheeks. She whispers at her ear: "Leia."

Charlie widens her eyes. "Wait, seriously? It can be -- is it really --?"

The girl bursts into a huge laugh, her eyes twinkling, her whole body trembling with the laughter, looking up and leaning back, laughing so hard that Charlie thinks she might even tumble and fall. Her hands reach out to lie on her waist before her brain register -- just to help her stand steady, she reasons for herself. But her traitorous hands do not take back even after the "Princess Leia" eases her laugh.

"No, it's Kara, actually." She wipes the tears at the corners of her eyes from laughing so hard. "You should look at your face." She's still giggling.

Charlie can't stop the tips of her mouth from lifting wide just from seeing her laughing. She wants that laugh never stop.

"You got me, that's a real good one, Princess Kara," Charlie says, not realizing her hands are still on Kara and slightly pulling in until she's practically standing right between her laps. The thin golden costume shifts slightly as she moves, leaving gaps and openings here and there, in the places no one should see. At least, now, at this moment, maybe ten minutes after talking to her -- or maybe it's already an hour, she's long lost track of or any sense of time -- her brain starts saying she wants to cover her up so she's the only one get to witness and devour this view of her.

Kara raises an eyebrow, amused, "Still calling me Princess?"

"Of course, always, sweetheart," Charlie answers, eyes moving down on her lips, swiftly shifting back to her eyes, silently asking.

Kara blinks rapidly, leaning down. Her hands land on Charlie's hair, her lips on hers.

The "Jedi Mind Trick" is definitely made of grapefruit juice and vodka. Charlie thinks, she can taste every bit of flavor from her tongue, as she's sure she can just taste that "Outer Rim" on hers.

She closes her eyes, holding her tighter, wanting to feel her body and warmth -- only to find she can't. That annoying 20-sided die costume is stupidly blocking the way, the bulk in front of her is just separating them too far away.

"My hotel, your Highness?" Charlie asks breathlessly between their kisses.

Kara doesn't even break the kiss to rush an eager nod, her tongue still tangled with Charlie's.

She has no idea how they get to the hotel without tripping over each other.

<br>

"Wait, wait, don't take that off yet. I love it."

They throw themselves on the memory foam bed -- Charlie finally manages to get rid of that die, lying on the bed with only her lingerie. Kara is reaching backward, trying to release her Slave Leia Bikini.

"I didn't know you love it so much." Kara stops midway, crawling onto bed with the costume on.

Charlie lifts her upper body, admiring the view. "Are you kidding me? This is world-classic award-winning level of sexy and beauty."

Kara narrows her eyes, "Oh, so it's the costume you are falling in love with? I'll make sure leaving it in your closet then, when I leave tomorrow."

Charlie laughs, reaching to caress her bare skin on the arms with her palms. "Yet you are still thinking about staying the night." She smirks.

Kara stares at her, a pretended glare. "God, I should know you'd be annoying. Did I just lose a persuasion roll?"

"No, I think that's a charisma roll and girl you nailed it, twenty-twenty big success in charming me." Charlie tells her brightly, pulling her closer.

Kara straddles on her, the golden piece of cloth covering her lower body dangles onto Charlie's chest. She lowers her body, almost lying on top of her but not quite, using her elbows for support. Their lips meet again and don't pull apart for a long time.

Charlie's hands follow the line of the golden thread from behind Kara's neck, across the shoulder, and to the front. Thin metal threads sewed together with silk and materials Charlie doesn't quite know she needs a Ph.D. for to know the names.

Her chest rises and falls under her touch, watching her move.

"You made all these by yourself? They're astounding! I mean, how did you even find those materials? So light and beautiful and not too hard to hurt the skin? How to possibly knit them together and make sure they fit?" She can't stop staring.

Kara laughs proudly. "I can show you one day. But are we here talking about costume making or making out?"

Charlie's fingers instantly reach backward to where the knots to tie the piece are and start working on removing them. "You're right, my mistake."

As much as she enjoys those clothes, she enjoys the body and skin behind them, and the brain and soul underneath them so much more.

It's an unbelievably wonderful night, a fantasy coming true.

So amazing and sweet and with everything she'd ever want. So perfect that, by morning, when the birds start singing, Charlie doesn't quite want to open her eyes.

The drinks from last night are still rendering her brain heavy -- or maybe it's something else. A night of too amazing dream and fantasy that she'd never think she'll have. She doesn't want to open her eyes to face the reality and know it really is just a dream yet. A dream where she's frantically in love with *Princess Leia* and making out with her in the slave suit.

She licks her lips, slowly letting out a content sigh, opening her eyes.

The girl from last night looks straight in her eyes with a sweet smile, "Morning, Sunshine."

"You're real," Charlie beams at her. "Kara." She whispers her name, reminding herself she's not Princess Leia, but a thousand times better.

"I love you." Charlie looks her in the eyes, telling her.

"I know." Kara answers with a brighter smile.

Of course that's the only correct answer, all things considered.

"I better get going now," Kara sits up, moving around to look for clothes.

The slave Leia costume was left on the chair by the bed last night, casually, from the look of that, but at least careful enough to not ruining any part. She starts tying the threads.

Charlie slowly lifts herself up, watching her. Her smile fades slowly into disappointment she can't hide no matter how hard she tries. "That's it?" she asks, a little hurt. Even though she knows she probably shouldn't. They only just met in a bar in a comic-con yesterday. And most of the time they were both at least a little drunk. An amazing one-night-stand is all she should have known to expect, instead of, say, thinking she's found the love of her life.

Kara stops her move, leaning back in to kiss her on the lips, soothing away the crinkle that starts forming between her eyebrows.

"I'd like to think it's fate leading us to run into each other last night," she tells Charlie. "Why don't we let fate decides again what would be our future."

Charlie wants to argue, but Kara already reaches for a die -- die for a DnD player is just like purse for everyone, you never run out of those; This one, in particular, is Charlie's lucky die she happened to leave on the bedstand before leaving for the Comic-Con yesterday.

"How about a ten-twenty roll, we'll have half the chance. Success, and I'll give you my number. Alright?" Kara holds her gaze with Charlie -- who stares at the die so hard, willing for it to obey, hoping never stronger she'd have to force so she could just silently change it to what she wants like Qui-Gon did for that die to free young Anakin -- kisses the die once, and rolls it on the bedstand.

It's a nine.

Charlie thinks the whole world is greyer a degree just that moment. "Come on, it's close enough." She pleads.

"You know the one and only DnD rule," Kara smiles weakly, looking just as disappointed.

"Never cheat. The die is the fate," she murmurs, defeated.

Kara leans in to kiss her on the forehead again, once. A farewell. "You never know, maybe we'll run into each other again."

Charlie tries hard to pull a smile again, meeting her light brown eyes. "Yeah, maybe. I'd really like to see you again."

"Then I'm sure we will." She says, leaving the room with a waved hand.

Charlie leans back at the headboard, staring at that "Nine" miserably.

<br>

She goes to the Comic-Con again, that day and the next.

There are many Laia's, but none of them is Kara.

On the last day, there is a tattoo stand in the convention center. The artist can draw anything, however wild your imagination goes.

Charlie watches her working for a while, and walks up to wait in the line.

She asks her to paint a "Princess Leia in a slave Bikini straddling a 20-sided die" on her right shoulder. The artist smiles gently with minor amusement. Charlie returns with a tilted tip of her lips -- the closest to a smile she can manage now.

She's in her casual cloth today, the die costume packed away in her suitcase, so no one can possibly understand the reference. No one ever will, if she doesn't start talking about her.

Not even Dean.

What's the point, if she's never going to run into her again. But at least, she doesn't want to forget that's something she had, something she could have, something tied to a die and a choice from fate.

"All tattoos are cool." Dean says, several hours after they first met.

Charlie swallows, "Mine is Princess Leia in a slave Bikini straddling a 20-sided die."

Dean stares at her, amused.

Charlie feels a need to explain: "I was drunk. It was Comic-Con."

Except, that's not true. Not entirely.

It was Comic-Con. But she wasn't drunk.

The tattoo artist asked her if she's sure about that. Washing a tattoo away could be troublesome. And she said yes.

She watched the lines and colors being added to her skin, the beautiful Princess emerging on her shoulder, in the beautiful golden threaded slave Bikini. Her braided hair flowed behind her. She straddled the die like riding a horse, with the cutest, sweetest smile on the tip of her lips.

It was even better than she imagined.

It didn't look like Princess Leia. It looked like Kara.

Charlie felt her heart clench. Squeezing her breathless.

She remembered that mixed bitter-sweetness from vodka and rum and grapefruit and salt in that kiss, on tip of her tongue.

She gave the artist that doomed die for reference, and made sure to paint the "Twenty" on the very top.

<br>

Charlie has been to way too many Star Wars themed conventions and activities and cruises and fan gatherings, and all the other big and small Comic-Cons she can manage to come to, if time and money allow, in between working at Richard Roman Enterprises.

Everyone around her thinks she's obsessed with Star Wars -- which isn't entirely wrong. She still enjoys the movies and new shows every now and then.

But she stops rewatching the *Return of the Jedi*. Even when watching with friends, she'd find excuse to skip the first forty minutes. The scenes with slave Leia, Charlie finds herself always so unbelievably easy to be turned on and sensing a taste of bitterness around a hole in her heart she doesn't want to handle.

She never finds anyone named Kara however hard she scraps the Internet -- she could crack Pentagon at 12, but she just couldn't find a person she's looking for. Sometimes she thinks her skills with computers are just not as good as she'd hope it be.

She still keeps that die -- so that in the middle of quiet nights, lying on bed sleepless, rolling and turning, feeling the other side of the bed is just too big, too empty, missing a person that should have been there, she can stare at the die, thinking for the thousands of time: What would her life be like, if the die rolled a "Ten" that day.

Little does she know, in a different world, an alternate world, Kara becomes a bakery owner, and she'd still be a programmer. She gets to live with her together -- the love of her life. And then the Apocalypse happens, and she has to watch her die.

And in that world, she'd wonder, if that day, the die gave them a "Nine," if it would hurt less; if her heart wouldn't break to pieces, she wouldn't have to watch blood pulping from her wounds, saying her name for the last time, and the light going out in her eyes; if it would be easier, to never have it at all, if she had to have it then lose it all.

She doesn't have an answer.

There is no answer.

<br>

**After work notes:**

I was just rewatching *Return of the Jedi* for god knows how many times, and my brain starts overlaying it with Charlie's words about her tattoo being "Princess Leia in a slave Bikini straddling a 20-sided die." And I start thinking, what if that's not just a joking, funny thing. What if there are actual meaning behind that. The word "straddle" sounds purposeful enough, what if both parties are actually referring to a person she met and didn't want to forget. And in a comic-con, both of those could be perfectly easy to be cosplayers' costumes. Hence the start setting of the story.

And then I ask myself, if she had someone, why didn't she now, when we met her in S07E21. Then I remember the Apocalypse world version of Charlie did have a love of her life, Kara, a bakery owner, and they live happily together. I immediately know this girl she met, in this world, is also Kara -- a different encounter, a different way of development.

Probably no one's gonna believe now this story was planned to be a one-shot fluff pwp with explicit scenes, then it gradually reduce from explicit level to barely mature, then the pwp turns into canon compliant plot, fluff turns to angst and pining and pain and miserable lonely life. I swear it wasn't the initial plan.

As for the ending, I'm also thinking, it might just be another example of what's in this post and hit me super hard: [NorthernSparrow's tumblr post](https://www.tumblr.com/northern-sparrow/178684831602): What if the world you are in, one without the love of your life, is actually in exchange for living in an Apocalypse world, where you'd both be there, together, but dying. So maybe, this world, normal, peaceful, no-Apocalypse world, is at the cost of losing the love of your life. Just like Apocalypse world Charlie and her Kara, and our Charlie but alone.

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Last thing, a little confession: It is watching slave Leia and starting to fantasize her that made me start thinking I might not be straight. And the fantasies with Charlie confirmed it. So I think, it's a must to write something for them as a tribute. And what's better than putting them together (though not exactly). Thank you for the enlightenment on my sexuality, ladies. Love you.</p>
