(tag: S05E08 Changing Channels, what if, Castiel is Baby, canon fix-it, background Sam/Eileen, canon divergent, canon compliant)

<br>

The smile is frozen on Trickster's face the moment Sam stabs the stake through his chest. The crappy CSI world bursts into TV static before that little brag's body hits the ground. Bloody foams bubble between his lips, drooping from the corner. The glint in his eyes fade completely as the world morphs back to the warehouse they first entered, before being thrown into that Dr. Sexy's hospital world.

Dean thinks he might would have felt a tad sorry for him if it's not the third time they try to kill the son of bitch -- if only this time it sticks.

His flannel and jacket come back, replacing the douchebag-looking uniform and sunglasses at night, that's a plus. Trickster's body lies lifelessly on the deserted floor -- for some reason, Dean had expected his body flashes into static just like the rest of the TV land scenes, instead of feeling so solid like this. He regards the dead Trickster's wide-open eyes for a short second -- he might have liked the guy if circumstances are different. But a little too late for that.

Dean walks out of the empty warehouse, calling behind him, "Time to pop out, Sam."

There is no answer.

Dean frowns, looking around. The dirt on the warehouse floor shows one set of foot prints leading outside -- his own.

"Cas? You there?" He tries.

Still no answer.

Maybe they were sent to different spots when the world returned to normal?

Dean sits on Baby's driver seat, dialing their numbers, wishing at least one of them still has their phone with them.

He curses when both got redirected to voice mail.

"Where are you?" Dean murmurs, igniting the car's engine without really thinking. He doesn't really have a clue of where to go to find them, but at least, keeping the car running is like a default option whenever there is a problem.

The light around the car's audio panel blinks when the engine comes to life.

"Dean?" Castiel's voice sounds up, somewhere close by. Like, really close -- sitting in the shotgun close.

But Dean is absolutely sure he's alone in the car. He squirms in the seat, checking a third time at the empty seats around him, just to be sure.

"Cas? Is that you? Where are you?" He raises his voice, asking the air.

"I don't know. The vessel doesn't feel right." Castiel answers. The light on the dashboard blinks in the same rhythm as he speaks. Dean notices it.

"Crap, I don't think Trickster is dead." Dean almost punches the wheel, just like every time he gets frustrated. On second thought, he knocks the dashboard with his knuckles, "You in there, buddy? Feel anything when I do that?"

Castiel's voice quiets for a second, then, "Oh, I see. And, yes, I can feel that."

"Great." Dean stares at the dashboard, breathing out harshly, trying not to think whether he's staring at his Baby or the angel right now. "Did my Baby say 'yes'? I didn't know cars can be angel vessels too. Actually, you know what? Don't answer that. Let's just find Sam first, we'll figure out the rest later. You okay with a little driving?"

Castiel answers gloomily, "Yes."

Dean swears he can tell by now those signal lights on the dashboard blinks unhappily, like eyes narrowing. He almost chuckles.

"Alright, you get any clue where to start?" Dean asks, as he steers the car -- the Baby, the angel, Jesus, this is so weird -- out of the back space of the warehouse, turning onto the road that is just as dusty and deserted.

"There is something you need to know," Castiel's voice lowers, as if afraid they might have an eardroper in the middle of nowhere -- which probably isn't wrong, knowing Trickster and his fake worlds.

"Let me guess, Trickster is not Trickster?" Dean glances between the road and the dashboard -- the way one would glance at the person they're talking to, except now his brain doesn't really know where to look.

"I think he might be Gabriel," Castiel's voice passes through the car's audio player quietly, unbothered by the lack of eye contact.

"The archangel Gabriel?" Dean is so distracted that his foot automatically presses on the acceleration pedal harder, only to feel a resistance force fighting back, "And what are you doing with my Baby, Cas?"

"I should be the one asking what are you doing with *me*, Dean." The light on the dashboard blinks, left side brighter than right side -- oh great, Cas manages to find a way to tilt his head even when his vessel is a car. Dean thinks he might never be able to look at Baby's dashboard normal again. He murmurs a quick "sorry" and eases on the pedal.

"And yes, Gabriel is one of the archangels." Castiel continues, keeping the car steady on its speed on the empty highway, heading north west.

"That explains a lot." Dean considers, "You know, the tossing-arounds. I never saw anyone getting the jump on you like that before, except, you know, that time you were holding off Raphael."

He drops his voice, grimacing at the memory last year, regretting he has to bring up the death memory for Cas.

Castiel is not disturbed by that. "Among all the archangels, Gabriel is the youngest, I think that's why he's also closest to us seraphs --"

Dean can't resist commenting, "Like an annoying uncle with little nieces and nephews, I get it."

Castiel continues, "-- but I haven't seen him for centuries. He looks very different from what I remember -- the vessel and the true form. He must have transformed his whole existence in the past centuries."

Dean nods at the windshield, watching the road rolling backward in a blur. He realizes he's not really looking at the road or paying attention on the wheels or the pedals anymore. He takes his hands and feet off the control. Baby continues the route steadily.

"You're taking over Baby?" Dean asks the dashboard.

"You asked me to drive," Castiel states plainly.

"When did --" Dean stops himself, "That's supposed to be a joke!" He sighs, resigned. "Actually, you know what? Not a bad idea, I can get a bit close-eyes if you don't mind, now that you're on it."

It's getting darker anyway.

"I don't mind," Castiel answers flatly.

Dean nods, resting his eyes, and then opens again, remembering an important question, "You never said where we are heading."

"Whitefish, Montana." Castiel tells him.

"Because?" Dean prompts, a little annoyed at the lack of detail.

"Sam might be there," Castiel says simply.

"How big of a 'might' are we talking about?" Dean can't help asking.

"Just, *might*." Castiel says, dimming all the lighting inside the car, including the ones blinking as he speaks.

"Alright, guess I'll have to live with that." Dean wraps his jacket around him to keep himself warm from a Midwest night in November -- they are probably somewhere in Indiana now, if not reach Wisconsin already. The car windows slide closed by themselves. Warm A/C is turned on.

Dean can't say he's not amused. "Thanks, Cas." he says with a slightly raised eyebrow and stifled chuckle, "Don't spoil me too much, I might miss you in the car form once this is over."

Castiel does not reply.

"Night," Dean murmurs, sliding down slightly to lean comfortably in the driver seat, keeping his feet away from the pedals, "Wake me up if you want a switch or anything, alright?"

The light on the dashboard blinks once as answer.

Dean closes his eyes and slips into the dreamland in the safe rumbling sound of Baby's rolling engine, knowing Baby would take care of him, and Cas would take care of Baby, or maybe the other way round. He dreams of his mom putting him to bed when he's still four.

<br>

The sky is still dark when he wakes up, and the barren, straight road is still flashing backward steadily.

"How long have I been out?" Dean yawns, stretching his legs as far as the driver seat allows.

"Five hours and twenty seven minutes." Castiel reports dutifully.

Dean huffs a small laugh, "That's more accurate than any of my alarm clocks ever did."

He checks his phone. No missed call or message. Not really surprising.

"How's the drive? Smooth? Want me take over?" Dean palms the wheel, caressing the leathered wheel absentmindedly, unsure of where else to put his hands when he's sitting in the driver seat.

"Uneventful," Castiel tells him.

"You can just say 'boring' if that's what you mean," Dean suggests.

"I'm used to it." Castiel says.

"Used to what, night-driving? Or, let me guess, night-flying?" Dean imagines how's that like for Cas.

"No, watching you sleep." Castiel corrects him.

"Dude! How many times I'll have to say that's weird?" Dean's glad at least one benefit of Cas inside the car is that he can't see his heated cheek -- or, can he? "Just like personal space!"

"Dean," Castiel's voice shifts a little -- the pitch is lighter, as if he's holding back the tiniest grin, "I think it is *you* in my space now. Literally."

Dean's one hundred percent sure his cheeks are burning now. "Shut up." He snaps, rubbing his own face.

The angel falls silent just as he's told.

But the silence very soon feels too loud. Dean has a very vivid feeling that a pair of big blue eyes locked on him -- the same way people would know they're watched from their back even if they can't see. And knowing it's Cas inside Baby, that might exactly be what's happening.

"Alright, why don't we play some music?" Dean fumbles the player, pressing the music button.

The expected "Ramble on" does not come out of the stereo. Instead, it's the "Sound of Music."

"What the hell?" Dean presses the "next song" button.

This time, it's some piano without lyrics, probably a classic piece from Bach or Beethoven, but Dean knows as much of them as a cat knows how to cook.

The one after that is another music without lyrics, the instrument sounds natural and woody, Dean's not sure he even knows the name of the instrument, but the music itself already makes him think about the lands he's never been before, like Africa or South America, so it's probably from somewhere like there.

Dean presses on the "pause" button hard.

"What the hell, Cas?" he glares at the audio station, the lights and buttons lining around there, as if the buttons have personally offended him. "Tell me you didn't mess with the music. I'll kill you if you wiped the cassettes."

Castiel does not answer.

For a brief second, Dean's not even sure if he's still in there, but then who else is driving the car if neither of them are.

He knocks on the dashboard with his knuckles, "Hello there? Don't you dare play dumb now. What did you do with the Zeppelin?"

"I didn't do anything." Castiel finally says.

"There he is," Dean mocks, "then what's with all the -- whatever that is?"

"That's '*El Cóndor Pasa*'," Castiel supplies helpfully. "a song of condors, from Peru --"

"Yeah, yeah, beautiful piece, I'm sure," Dean cuts his words quickly, "I mean, remember Rule One in this car?"

"Driver picks the music." Castiel answers.

"Shotgun shuts his cakehole -- okay, you don't have a cakehole right now, but anyway, you get the idea?" Dean interrogates.

"Which is why I get to choose the music," Castiel says reasonably.

"What? No!" Dean knocks on the dashboard warningly, "For what's worth, I'm still the driver!"

"And who's driving right now?" Castiel's voice sounds unreasonably braggy now. Dean can swear he'd have that small glint of mischief in his eyes if he's in a human vessel.

"You --" Dean's muted for a minute, defeated. "Son of a bitch." Now he can totally see Trickster is Cas's family.

He has to listen to that Peruvian music for the rest of the night -- which, admittedly, isn't half bad. It sounds peaceful and far away, so far away that none of the trouble of the world can contaminate the music, it calms him down. But Dean wouldn't ever say it's better than Zeppelin for his whole life.

<br>

The wheel turns sharply on a crossroad to the left side when the sun rises behind their tail. From what he can tell, instead of heading west, they're going south now.

"What happened?" Dean sits straight in the seat, knuckles rounding around the wheel cautiously, though without much force, still letting Cas turning it left and right, maneuvering around the natural curves of the road. "Where are we going now?"

"Kermit, Texas." Castiel says, his voice a little strained -- the kind that says they're in trouble, and it's worse than "a nest of werewolf" kind.

"Sam moved over the night?" Dean asks, not really expecting the joke to land, except --

"Yes," Castiel says plainly, no sign of joke in his voice, "in a way."

Dean glares at the dashboard, imagining that's Cas's eyes, "Care to elaborate?"

"I think..." the lights on the dashboard blink a few times, hesitating.

Dean raises his eyebrows.

"I think Gabriel has trapped Sam in a different version of reality." Castiel says carefully. "Another TV channel, but it feels real to him. It even has us and all the people he knew in there. Right from the moment you left the warehouse."

"Get to the punchline, Cas." Dean urges impatiently.

"The time he senses moves a lot faster than ours. That explains why I can't get a clear read of his location -- he moves around a lot faster than I can get hold onto him."

Dean swallows, "How long has he been through?"

"The real time in our sense is only a few hours --"

"Cas, how long?" Dean snaps.

Castiel answers: "Three years."

Dean wipes his face, exhaling deeply. "Three years, for Christ's sake." He doesn't know what to make of it.

Only after a couple of minutes is he able to speak again: "What happened in those three years? In the life that asshole Gabriel made him believe is true?"

"We were fighting Lucifer and the Apocalypse, then Sam jumped into the Cage with Lucifer. His soul was locked with the Devil for an entire year because I went bad, saved his body without his soul. Then he suffered a lot from a broken wall, and I broke the Purgatory and let Leviathans out. You saved the world again, except..." He pauses again.

"Except what, Cas?" Dean doesn't realize his knuckles are white from grabbing the wheel tight now. "Why is Sam in Kermit, Texas?"

"He believes you and me are dead now, and he's moving in with a girl called Amelia, not hunting anymore." Castiel tells him in a quiet voice.

"Retired. So he's heartbroken and retired." Dean blinks, suddenly stepping on the acceleration pedal hard. "Let's get to him fast then, before he moves again or whatever. He'll know all those Cage stuffs are crappy illusions, everything is just made up by an assclown archangel."

The pedal moves to the bottom without complaint, the Impala is pushed to her limit, racing on the road like cheetah on savannas. Dean can feel the safety belt tighten on his body, knowing exactly who's doing that. He doesn't say anything.

<br>

"Dean, he moved again."

They're almost at the border between Missouri and Arkansas when Castiel talks again.

"Where?" Dean grits his teeth. The oil tank is getting low, and they have been racing for a whole day. But apparently their speed is still just too slow for Gabriel's like.

"Maine, 100-mile wilderness. You and me were just out of Purgatory, and Sam believes he's going through three Hell trials to close Hell's gates for go. Maine is where he'd go to Hell to save Bobby's soul and come back up, through Purgatory's portal."

"Jesus, that's so messed up. So what, Gabriel can just make up anything and Sammy would just buy them in? How fucked up our life is that he'd just believe those bullshitting things can all happen for real? Purgatory? Leviathans? Hell trials, really?"

Dean takes a sharp U-turn in the middle of the road, ignoring the double yellow lines, heading north-east now. "Maine, that gotta be the farthest spot Gabriel can find in US before sending him to Canada. What's next, Montreal?"

"Dean," the engine sounds exhausted, so is Castiel's voice.

Dean glances at the empty gas sign on the dashboard. "Just a few miles." He tries to coax the Baby-slash-angel. It used to work with Baby.

"Dean." Castiel warns him again, the gas signal flashing red. Dean can practically hear the dry hoarseness in his voice.

"Alright, okay, let's feed you first." They drive off the highway and pull into the closest gas station.

"You need to rest too, again." Castiel says, as the pump feeding cheap gas into the tank.

"Dude, don't speak when there are audience." Dean whispers under his breath, glancing at the clerk behind the gas station convenience store counter. "They'd think I'm crazy, or you're cursed or something. Honk if you have to."

The light on the dashboard blinks twice. Dean takes that as a yes.

"We can do the same as last night. You drive the night, I can sit-sleep. I'm a professional at sit-sleeping now." Dean suggests, once they're back on road. He leaves a bag of snacks on the shotgun seat, half-eaten beef jerk lying outside the plastic bag, black pepper-flavored. The window on that side lowers a small slit.

"You need some proper rest," Castiel objects. "We don't know how long this will take. You don't want to burn out before catching up with Sam."

"There's not much 'catching up' to do if we wait out, it's like whack-a-mole, he's just everywhere." But Dean knows Castiel is right, he just can't let himself agree. His butt hurts from sitting for too long, his shoulder and back are sore, and he feels his legs and arms are rusty, like robots fixed in the same position for too long. He can use a real night of sleep in a real bed -- except, knowing Sam's beaten up by Gabriel's fake world, he just can't rest.

"What's Sam doing now?" Dean thinks out loud. "What's his version of world is like now?"

"Angels are falling, Sam has an angel living inside him, who lied about his true identity." Castiel reports.

"More freaking messes. Why am I not surprised?" Dean says, unamused. The moon has risen on the left side of the road, hanging low.

"Why don't you go sleep in the back seat?" Castiel says, taking back the control. The wheel slightly nudge Dean out of grasp.

"I'm not sleepy," Dean argues.

"Yes, you are." Castiel insists, "Now go. I can drive. I *am* the car, after all."

It's the world's ultimate final for stubbornness competition.

Dean tries to argue again, but a yawn comes out of his mouth without permission. He climbs to the back seat and uses his jacket as a layer of comforter. Soft warm air from A/C circulates around him, almost like natural wind.

The drive is actually steady enough to imagine it's motionless, if not considering the sound of engine. Castiel has switched the music player, turning to Debussy's "Moonlight", according to his introduction.

Dean asks with his eyes closed, "Cas, which part of you am I sleeping on?"

"What?" Castiel's voice is muffled with the piano sound, but Dean can hear the confused head tilting motion from the syllable.

"Please tell me it's your lap or something decent, 'cause if it's somewhere... funny, I don't want to think about it." Dean says in a sleepy voice.

"Stop thinking about it." Castiel tells him, "It's not your first time sleep in the car."

But not with an angel inside. Dean thinks, but he doesn't say it. He just hums softly, and the sleep falls on him.

<br>

The next day isn't too different.

They don't get half-way to Maine when Cas says Sam has moved again, he's in Nebraska, because apparently at some point the Dean in his world has taken over a dark evil Mark of Cain and they let the Darkness into the world, who's also God's sister. And then Washington, where they start some multiverse traveling. Then Ohio, because God is the bad guy now and Sam -- along with Dean and Castiel and everyone else he knew -- are saving the world *again*.

They drive south, west, north, east, circling on the map like a aimless fly hitting a glass, except they know where they're going, they're just forever too slow. It's exhausting.

Dean bangs his head on the wheel more than once, and gets told by Castiel not to do that again.

"That bastard is imaginative, I'll give you that." Dean leans back on the seat, eating some drive-through fries that's getting cold and soggy -- the most disgusting food in the world, but food nonetheless. He manages to remember to eat something every time he fuels Cas -- his brain might make the Pavlov's Dog's reflex very soon.

"Lebanon, Kansas." Castiel takes another big round turn on the crossroad, changing route again.

"Are we going to do this forever?" Dean sighs -- he's even too tired to snap now, just wonders aloud. "Sam living his version of life, we chase around forever? You stuck in a car -- the coolest car in the world, by the way -- and I'm just, eating junk food and not really doing anything. I can't even give him a goddamn phone call."

"I think this might be the last place." Castiel says glumly.

That's good news, wait no -- Cas's tone sounds weird. It's the bad-news tone.

"How do you know?" Dean straightens slowly, wiping his fingers on some ruffled napkin.

"God is defeated, the Earth is peaceful now, everyone is finally free." Castiel tells him, leaving the obvious hint unsaid.

"Too good to be true. Sounds like the end of the line." Dean murmurs, getting the twisted feeling around the gut. "He's not dead, is he?" His throat is tightened just for thinking that.

"No, he's fine." Castiel answers immediately, "You're fine too."

Dean lets out a short, relieved breath, "You know it's funny. We both know it's just his version of life -- Gabriel's, really. Some funko's wild imagination, but it feels real. Like, I feel like a fake of myself now. Not sure what I'd feel if I have to live the life of the other me, the one Sammy thought he's been with all this time."

"Except you're real, the other you isn't." Castiel says quietly, his voice firm. "It's not even really ten years, it just feels like ten years to him, because Gabriel made it that way."

"What about you?" Dean can't help asking.

"I was... gone, in that version. But let's not worry about that." Castiel slurs quickly. "Sam needs us."

"Alright, Lebanon, Kansas, then. Let's pull him out of the long nightmare." Dean pats the side of the driver's seat, pretending that's where Cas's shoulder would be.

<br>

Sam walks out of the bunker slowly, looking back at the big sad empty space one last time, and turns off all the light. The gate locks with a heavy thud.

He stares at the patterned key in his clenched fist for a long minute, feeling the rims of his eyes hot and wet again. It's not like he's going to come back here again, not when both Dean and Cas are gone, not like it's ever going to be a home for him. He still doesn't have the heart to leave the key behind.

Miracle circles around his ankle, whining softly, nudging him gently with its nose. Sam wipes his eyes carelessly with the back of his hands, picking up the dog in his arms.

"At least I still have you, right?" Sam talks to the dog, breathing out a short broken breath, pulling a teary smile, and turns around.

Dean leans on the passenger side of Impala, with his hands poked in the jean pockets, hanging a young wide smile on his face. "Hello, Sammy."

<br>

Sam jumps so fiercely he almost drops the dog to the ground. His hands tremble violently, half-way reaching back to the back of his belt, presumably for his gun, out of instinct, but stops mid-way, just hanging there, frozen. His face is torn apart trying to decide whether to dash toward him and squeeze him in a hug tight enough to choke him, or flee as far away from him as possible, and possibly shoot him.

Sam's voice is devastated when he speaks, "I just burned you, Dean." Tears stream down his face, "So whoever you are, you're not my brother. So what are you?" His pistol appears in his right hand, safety clicked off.

Dean withdraws the smile, putting both his hands in the air, looking Sam in the eyes. "It's really me, I'm real. Whatever you've been through in the past ten years, it's not real."

"I imagined you, didn't I? You're my hallucination, and I've gone crazy again. Is that it?" Sam lowers his gun, staring at the front tip of Dean's shoes.

Dean steps toward him slowly, one step at a time. When he's finally within reach, he takes the gun from Sam's hand who doesn't put up a fight, and puts the safety click back on, before throwing it on the ground.

Sam just looks at his moves through his saddest eyes.

Dean pulls Sam into a tight hug, whispering by his ear, "You feel this? It's real, I'm real. I got you now."

Sam finally wraps his arms around Dean's back, whimpering on his shoulder with all the tears. "What happened? I saw you died, Dean. I swear I thought this is it, the final end, no taken-back again."

"We might need a little bit rewind. And you probably want to sit down somewhere." Dean tells him.

Sam doesn't quite want to go back into the bunker, so they end up both sitting in the backseat of the Impala. Dean pats the car roof once before going in, hoping that's enough hint for Cas for the short notice.

Sam's still staring at Dean when they get into the car, like he's going to pop out of air any moment. Dean's heart clutches tight, wanting to kick something every minute he has to see eyes like that.

The car door closes around them automatically. Soft lyrics of "Carry on, my wayward son" start playing in the player, though the sound is quiet enough that it's barely a humming tune in the background. Dean shoots a quick appreciated glance at the dashboard.

"Alright, let me ask you this," Dean starts, rubbing his temples slightly to get himself prepared, "What year do you think this is?"

"Why? 2025, of course." Sam answers in confusion.

"Welcome to 2010, Sammy." Dean tries to pull a smile, but meeting Sam's look, he just can't.

"I don't understand." Sam frowns deep, "Is this time travel? You're the Dean from fifteen years ago, coming to save your future self?"

"Wait, fifteen?" Dean frowns slightly, then realizes, "Crap, that's extra five years just before we got here. I'm so sorry, Sammy. I tried to get to you earlier, I really tried. But Cas and I, we just couldn't..."

"Dean, I don't understand." Sam says desperately. "You're not making any sense."

"One word," Dean holds out a finger, "-- Trickster."

"What about Gabriel? He died in the apocalypse world, fighting the other world Michael. You knew that." Confusion does not reduce the slightest on Sam's face.

"I assure you, he's very much alive. Still bumping around, totally fine and happy, and still douchy. Probably having way too much fun watching us suffer -- especially you. I really want to punch that asshole in the face before deep-frying his wings extra crispy. This is personal." Dean grits his teeth. "You remember that time when he trapped us in the TV channels? Welcome from here."

"Oh God, you're telling me... none of this is real? Everything since 2010?" Sam says slowly, widening his eyes, utterly horrified. "Right after I thought it's finally over, you're telling me the board is wiped, *again*? So those fifteen years are what, just like a dream? A djinn world? Puff, and all gone?" He starts reaching for the door handle, struggling to get out, get away, shaking his head in disbelief.

The door doesn't give, but the window on his side is lowered. Sam breathes violently on the cold fresh air.

"Sam, please." Dean begs, tears starting to gather in his eyes as well. He holds out a hand but not quite touch, just in a gesture of trying to calm a frightened caged little creature. "I know it must be a lot to take, but isn't it better than, I don't know, Hell and Purgatory and all that? None of those ever really happened, it gotta mean something, right?"

Sam is still inhaling and exhaling unevenly, but the pace slows down gradually. He whispers in choked voice, "Do you have any idea how it feels? If nothing is real, does that mean everyone I met are just, like Dr. Sexy in that TV hospital? Is Eileen real? Is Miracle...?"

Dean shoots a desperate look at the dashboard -- at Cas. He doesn't even know who Eileen is, what should he even say?

"I don't know, Sam, I'm sorry. We don't know." Dean can't bare to see Sam's heartbroken eyes any longer, turning to look outside the window.

A small dog with curly white hair is chasing his own tail, just outside the door. Dean opens the car door, the dogs leaps in, sitting on Sam's lap. Sam holds it with a small startled voice.

Dean's just about to reiterate the "no dog in car" rule, but holds his tongue when he sees all the lines on Sam's face softens.

"That must be Miracle." He says.

Sam combs the dog's hair with his fingers, looking at it fondly. "Yeah, he is. You named him that. I think miracles are never going to stop happening around him now." He even smiles a little.

Dean watches him closely, then, "He looks real enough to me, no reason your girl isn't."

Sam jerks his head up sharply, "I never said she and I are..."

"Oh come on, I know that look. You think I don't know my little brother falling in love?" Dean nudges him laughingly. "Why don't you give her a call, just check up. We can, uh, recalibrate the reality from there."

Sam rushes to get his phone out, dialing the number before he even gets out of the car. The door opens automatically for him, but Sam doesn't notice. He gestures rapidly at the video screen. Dean stays inside the car, pulling up all the windows, just to give him some more privacy.

Castiel asks quietly through the audio player, "Is he going to be okay?"

Dean glances at the figure, "He's strong."

"Are you?" Cas asks again.

Dean shrugs, "Can't complain. We're all here, very alive, aren't we?"

Castiel hums softly.

"And you?" Dean throws the question back.

Cas seems to surprised to be asked. The signal lights on the dashboard flash briefly, like a computer progress bar in loading mode, then, "I will be."

Dean is just about to ask what he means, when there is a small knock on the window. Sam bends over the driver side window, with a big stupid smile on his face.

Dean steps out, asking but already knew the answer, "How's it going?"

"Eileen's fine -- real, I mean -- both." Sam stutters.

"How you feel?" Dean prompts.

"Hopeful, I think." Sam tilts his head slightly, considering, "I would have wished to give anything to have all of us back, alive, before any of those happen. Looks like now I just got what I wished. Be careful about what you wish for, right?"

He suddenly remembers something, asking quickly with a stunned look on his face, "Wait, 2010, does that mean Bobby is still alive?"

"Alive and kicking," Dean grins, but quickly corrects himself, "well, not much kicking per say, man's grumpy on wheelchair, but he's generally fine."

"And Ellen and Jo?"

"All well and happy, working with us on saving the world." Dean answers.

"Oh thank God -- I mean, thank... whoever." Sam lets out a long breath.

"I'm not going to thank Gabriel." Dean grimaces.

Sam chuckles easily, "You never know."

"I'm telling you, after this, I'll never trust any angel, like ever again. Except Cas." Dean says sternly.

"Speaking of, where is Cas?" Sam asks.

"Told you, in the car." Dean glances at the dashboard again, expecting to see some answering lightings, and satisfied to find exactly what he imagined.

"Yeah I heard you the first time, except, he really is not." Sam frowns. "I don't see anyone in the car. To be honest, I'm worried you're imagining him up, you know, since five years ago..."

"No, I mean, *in the car*. As in -- he *is* the car. More or less. Baby is still in there, I imagine." Dean gestures vaguely at the whole of Impala.

Castiel helps very aptly in time to honk once, then speaks through the audio player, "Hello, Sam."

Sam gapes in shock, "Shit, you mean literally." then quickly, "Sorry, I mean, hello, Castiel." he turns to Dean hurriedly, "What happened?"

"Just some small problems to fix." Dean says easily, then remembers Sam's slipped words, "What happened five years ago? The Cas in your world?"

Sam avoids his eyes, smoothly answers with more questions, "The two of you are good?"

Dean raises an eyebrow, "Why wouldn't we be?"

Sam shrugs, "I don't know, just asking."

Dean: "Anything you want to tell me?"

Sam starts walking away from the car, "No, go ask Cas." He turns just in time to meet Dean's challenging questioning eyes, Sam rolls his eyes, "Just, talk to him before too late."

"Alright, fine, I will." Dean thinks he might be able to put two and two together already. He didn't miss the way Cas mentioned the other himself "was gone" but waved it off like it's nothing before they headed out to Lebanon. "-- after the dude gets his legs back. I can't have a heart-to-heart when he's, you know, with four wheels."

"Why not? You do that with Baby all the time."

Dean rolls his eyes, "... why not? You're kidding, right?"

The car honks gently once, from ten steps away. Sam nudges him playfully. Dean rolls his eyes more dramatically, but walks back to the car -- to Cas, and sits into the driver seat.

Sam goes back to his video-talking phone and the dog, and Dean heads out for a short drive.

As it turns out, having a heart-to-heart when the other party is the car is way easier than talking to a human, Dean Winchester finds out. Without feeling the weight of a pair of blue, blue eyes staring down -- even though he's not going to admit how much he misses them -- it feels the words can form so much easier when he can just stare outside the windshield.

He does have enough practice like this with Baby. And with Castiel, it becomes natural.

Cas tells him about ten times the other version of him died for Dean, all the ones Sam has witnessed and believed. And then his final one, then Dean's final moments.

Dean's quiet for a long stretch of the road, they almost make the whole detour to Colorado instead of just a local quick run down around Lebanon like Dean initially planned, it's Cas taking them both back.

"How much of those are real? I mean, imagining that's really you in those positions?" Dean manages to ask in the end, his voice broken. His hands on the wheels are the only things keeping him composed.

"Saving you, and saving the world, whatever it takes?" Castiel's voice comes out clear and steady, "All of it. Why do you think I'd sacrifice everything for you last year? I fell for you, Dean. Do you think that's a one-time deal?"

Dean swallows hard. He presses his forehead on the wheel, closing his eyes, putting his lips on the car's wheel, like he did probably a million times with Baby before.

"Thanks, baby -- I mean, Cas. Thanks, Cas."

Dean feels his breath become so easy now, as if something in his chest just get smoothed out.

He smiles stupidly at the road in front of them, the stretches rolling back in a blur.

"Now, let's pick Sam up, fix you up, send Gabriel a card, and kick his ass. In that order."

<br>

When Dean pulls over in front of the bunker again, he really isn't surprised to run into Sam's shit-eating grin.

"How's the talk with your angel?" Sam climbs into the shotgun seat.

Dean throws him a glance, still in a too good mood, "I never said he's mine..."

"Oh come on, I know that look." Sam mocks, "You think I don't know my big brother falling in love?"

Okay, he should totally see this coming. Karma is a bitch, so is Sam.

"Jerk." Sam retorts, opening his laptop, starting to look for some latest hint on Gabriel and Lucifer and possibly Michael too.

Apocalypse round two is still on the calendar, and the loose nuclear assbutts from Heaven and Hell are still out running around. But on the bright side, the three of them are back together; even brighter side, they know what's coming -- Gabriel's version, things like doing a soul headcount when leaving the Cage and keeping an eye out for Chuck early on -- and this time, they get to try things out differently, and hopefully, saving more people, saving the world again without too much loss. What more can they ask for?

Dean pushes on the acceleration pedal, heading forward in a flash.

And the music Cas chooses to put on this time, is right on spot -- Zeppelin's "Ramble On."

He's totally spoiled now. Dean thinks. There is nothing they can't fix, and everything is just perfect as they are.
