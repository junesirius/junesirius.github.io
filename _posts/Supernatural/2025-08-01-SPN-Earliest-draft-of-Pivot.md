Holy, just read the very early draft of 'Pivot', it blew my mind. It's the version Sam doesn't know anything about Supernatural until Dean comes to get him from Stanford. And Sam thinks Dean's crazy and needs help, and Dean practically kidnaps him to the car and start working on the women in white case.

John is called Jack, their last name is not Winchester, it's Harrison. Mary dies when Sam is 9 and Dean is 13, in an unexplained car accident. Sam hasn't seen John for 12 years, and by the time Dean comes to get him, John's dead already. They grew up with Aunt and Uncle. Dean's always smoking. Dean's only hunting with John for the last two years, and he hasn't seen Sam for two years. Oh, and, after Sam knows John is dead (and is killed brutally until unrecognizable), Sam's first reaction is scared, he thinks it's Dean went crazy and killed John, and he's afraid Dean's going to kill him too.

And admittedly, the Dean appeared in the script for the first twenty minutes does look like a psychopath (sort of, in a manner). Like a crazy lunatic serial killer (from some aspects). It's not Sam's fault to assume that, really.

> Dean: "I didn't kill him."
>
> Sam: "Then who did?"
>
> Dean: "**You think I'm capable of hurting Dad? Or you?**"
>
> Sam: "**I don't know.**"

And when Dean plays the family card:

> Dean: "I can't do it alone. Dad tried that already."
>
> Sam: "That doesn't make sense, even for you. Why me?"
>
> Dean: "Because. We owe it to Dad. **We're his family.**"
>
> Sam: "**Since when?**"

When Dean tries to persuade Sam to help the case:

> Dean: "People are dying."
>
> Sam: "So call the cops."
>
> Dean: "They won't believe us. Nobody will. **This is up to us.**"
>
> Sam: "**Says who?**"

Holy crap, this whole thing can get so much darker than it is.

But on the bright side, they didn't grow up with John, didn't grow up in a hunter's life. Parentless, living with Aunt and Uncle, but at least they had a childhood of some sort. I really can't think of how the story will continue with a setting like that. It's like, I can't imagine a Dean and a Sam with the whole setting with John and Mary and childhood trauma changed.

God knows I was only trying to go back to 'Pivot' to refer to the trauma scene, and to check if Dean had run into Nursery during the fire or not. (He didn't, so technically he never really saw the scene with Mary burning on the ceiling, only the fire. That's good, or he'd be even more traumatized. He probably grew up hearing from John talking about the scene and imagined it, and changed his memory and thought he had seen it though. But he really didn't, as the trailer shows. John made sure of it.)

But meta-narratively, EK is like the God of this world, so this story of Dean and Sam Harrison, with Mary Harrison died in a car accident (caused by spirit or demon) and Jack Harrison dumped them ever since and died trying to kill the monster alone, would have been just one of the variations of their alternate universe, where these actually happened. That's just all so screwed up.

And by the way, the very first woman-in-white case, in this version, the woman didn't kill her children. She's abused by her parents growing up, so she killed them, and abducted men and killed them in her house in front of her parents. Talking about parallels, all the more twisted parent-children relationship topic. Jeez.

The only thing that remains the same in the three versions of drafts I read tonight (this very first early stage 2004 draft, a 2005 draft script that's closer to the show but they're still called Harrison, and a 2005 production script), is that the car is always a vintage BLACK CHEVY IMPALA. Though the scripts all said it's 1965, we have it 1967 in the end. So the only unchanged thing, at the end of the day, is still Baby. No wonder it relies on Baby to save the world.

(a couple of excerpts below the cut)

<br>

> Dean: (lights a smoke, offers one to Sam) Hey. So listen... I'm sorry I've been so M.I.A.
>
> Sam: I don't smoke -- don't apologize. I'm not mad.
>
> Dean: Well. That was a pretty clenched delivery...
>
> Sam: Really. I mean it. You got your deal, I got mine. You don't owe me anything.
>
> (They're driving, Dean told him they're going home, but he's driving a different route)
>
> Sam: What are you doing?
>
> Dean: Minor detour. Gotta take care of something.
>
> Sam: (irritated) You're not gonna go score some drugs or something, are you?
>
> Dean: (rolls his eyes) Yeah, Scarface, I'm gonna go "score some drugs."

<br>

> Dean: Listen. Sam. I sorta had a reason for bringing you along. We need to talk.
>
> Sam: About what?
>
> Dean: About Dad.
>
> Sam: No, we don't.
>
> Dean: Yeah. We do.
>
> Sam: Look. I'm sorry what I told Jess, okay, but I don't see --
>
> (Sam told Jess both his parents were dead when he's 9)
>
> Dean: It's not that. Sam. I went looking for him.
>
> Sam: You what? (suddenly numbs with realization; quietly) I have ridden in a car like this. Haven't I? I've ridden in this car. This is his.
>
> Dean: (nods)... I've been staying with him.
>
> Sam: Since when? For how long?
>
> Dean: (after a beat) Two years.
>
> Sam: Pull over.
>
> Dean: Sam --
>
> Sam: PULL OVER!
>
> (The Impala pulls to the shoulder.)
>
> Sam: (apoplectic, leaps out of the car) How could you not tell me?!
>
> Dean: (through the window) It's a little... complicated. But I'll explain.
>
> Sam: Where is he now?
>
> Dean: Texas.
>
> Sam: I don't want to see him.
>
> Dean: You don't have to. Just calm down, okay? Get in the car.
>
> Sam: (sits in, tired, overwhelmed) I mean, is he... is he okay? How's his... you know -- (taps his temple)
>
> Dean: Okay, this next part's the hard part, it was hard for me, too. But Dad... he's not schizophrenic. He never was.
>
> Sam: What do you mean?
>
> Dean: (presses the gas, the car rumbles down the road) Close your door -- I mean, I think he was telling the truth. About the accident. About Mom.
>
> Sam: That's not funny.
>
> Dean: No. No, it isn't.
>
> Sam: You think... I'm sorry, WHAT do you think killed Mom?
>
> Dean: Maybe a spirit. Maybe a demon. We never found out for sure.
>
> Sam: (tries to control his rising anxiety) There's no such things.
>
> Dean: I know how this sounds, I do. And you know me, I used to beat up those D&D nerds. (beat) But there ARE such things. All kinds of things. EVERY kind of thing. Out there in the dark. (beat) I've seen them, Sam. With my own eyes.
>
> Sam: I don't believe you.
>
> Dean: Don't worry. You will.
>
> Sam: (OFFICIALLY FREAKED OUT) Where are you taking me?
>
> Dean: I'm sorry. But I gotta show you. What these things do to people. (beat) I gotta show you proof.
>
> Sam: (rattled)

<br>

(Dean drags Sam to ask coroner questions about some case-related questions. Sam is sick and ask for bathroom)

> Sam: (going to be sick) Bathroom?
>
> Coroner: Down the hall. On the left.
>
> Sam: (bolts from the room)
>
> But the moment he reaches the men's room, he's suddenly looking quite healthy. He's not sick; it was an act. Making sure Dean's not following, Sam bolts for the stairwell and gets outside.
>
> (Sam calls his Aunt. This is where he knows Dad just died.)
>
> Sam: Aunt Cheryl. It's Sam.
>
> Aunt: Where are you? You should be home by now --
>
> Sam: I'm with Dean. Listen, I think he's sick, he --
>
> Aunt: Dean? Does he know?
>
> Sam: (thrown for a loop) Know what?
>
> Aunt: ... so he doesn't. I guess I need to talk to him, too, then...
>
> Sam: You alright? What's going on?
>
> Aunt: ... police called the house this morning. They found your Father. In some junk yard. In Texas. He's... he's dead, Sam. I'm sorry.
>
> Sam: (spinning) Are they sure?
>
> Aunt: (tearing) They had to use... dental records. Someone... someone killed him. They said he was... unrecognizable.
>
> Sam: (veins run cold, struggles to rein in a hurricane of fear, emotion.)
>
> When he pivots, he DIRECTLY runs into Dean.
>
> Dean: (snags the cell phone from Sam, clicks it shut, pockets it)
>
> Sam: (backs away, as if from a rabid dog)
>
> Dean: I was gonna tell you. I didn't wanna scare you.
>
> Sam: (smart-ass despite fear) Yeah, well, bang up job with that.
>
> Dean: I'm sorry you heard about Dad like that. But just hold on a minute.
>
> Sam: I haven't seen the man in 12 years. Believe me, that's not why I'm upset.
>
> Dean: (waits a moment) You think...? I didn't kill him.
>
> Sam: Yeah? Then who did?
>
> Dean: It's a little... complicated.
>
> Sam: I'm sick of hearing that. (Dean advances) Stay the hell away from me.
>
> Dean: What, you gonna call the cops? Have me arrested?
>
> Sam: (mind reels, looks back at the hospital) We'll go inside. Talk to a doctor. Get you some help.
>
> Dean: I know how all this looks, believe me. But just think for a minute. You think I'm capable of hurting Dad? Or you?
>
> Sam: I don't know.
>
> Dean: It's still me. Just let me explain. That's all I'm asking.

<br>

(When Dean's trying to persuade Sam to walk the first case with him together)

> Sam: (incredulous) You're still chasing it. You think it's here.
>
> Dean: Maybe. Unexplainable car accidents. Exactly like Mom's. Something strange is going on, that's for sure. (beat) You have to help me, Sam.
>
> Sam: Help you... do what?
>
> Dean: Find it and kill it.
>
> Sam: WHAT?
>
> Dean: I can't do it alone. Dad tried that already.
>
> Sam: That doesn't make sense, even for you. Why me?
>
> Dean: Because. We owe it to Dad. We're his family.
>
> Sam: Since when?
>
> Sam: (slides Dad's journal back across the table, determined) Dean. These are just... ramblings. They're not real. Listen. We're going back to L.A. Aunt Cheryl and Uncle Tommy, they're gonna get you the best help in the world.
>
> Dean: (quiet challenge) You can't make me go, Sam.
>
> Sam: You can't make me stay. I'm outta here. Whether you're coming or not.
>
> Dean: (dangles his CAR KEYS in front of Sam) Okay. Look. You really think I'm cuckoo for cocoa puffs? Then take these. Go. I won't chase you.
>
> Sam: (conflicted, torn, finally decline the offer)
>
> Dean: (grateful smile)
>
> Sam: Wipe that smile off your face. You're delusional and you need help and I'm not about to leave you alone, to hurt yourself. Or somebody else. (beat) Plus, you definitely would've chased me.
>
> Dean: Well. You're right about that. Come on.
>
> Sam: Where are we going?

<br>

(After they found enough proof to show this woman-in-white case isn't related to whatever killed their mom)

> Sam: Where are you going?
>
> Dean: To find a motel.
>
> Sam: What?
>
> Dean: It's too late to talk to Constance's Mom. We'll go see her in the morning.
>
> Sam: No. This is over. We're going back to L.A.
>
> Dean: Sorry.
>
> Sam: This has nothing to do with us, you said so yourself.
>
> Dean: (beat) Maybe so. But we still gotta kill it.
>
> Sam: Stop the car.
>
> Dean: What, you gonna walk?
>
> Sam: You won't come home? You won't let me help you? Fine. But I won't do this anymore. STOP THE CAR.
>
> Dean: Sam. People are dying.
>
> Sam: So call the cops.
>
> Dean: They won't believe us. Nobody will. This is up to us.
>
> Sam: SAYS WHO?
>
> Dean: Dad. It's what he did. (then) These things, they're all part of the same thing. So Dad killed 'em. Every single one he found.
>
> Sam: (sarcastic) Right. So he was, like, a superhero.
>
> Dean: No. He was tired and scared. But if he didn't do it, who would? And now he's gone --
>
> Sam: -- and for all I know, you murdered the man.
>
> Dean: You know I didn't. (flaring) Sam, you're really being a selfish prick here.
>
> Sam: Oh? Am I?
>
> Dean: This isn't just my responsibility. They're your parents, too. (beat) What if someone could've saved Mom?
>
> Sam: (finally ERUPTING) No one could've saved Mom! Because nothing killed her, except Dad!
>
> Dean: That's not true.
>
> Sam: Dean. You're trying to give Mom's death this... larger meaning. Like all our suffering was for a reason. (beat) But it wasn't. It was just random, senseless tragedy. Dad was an alcoholic and a schizophrenic.
>
> Dean: Don't say that.
>
> Sam: He drove drunk, killed his wife, abandoned his kids, and THAT'S the truth...
>
> Dean: Shut your mouth! RIGHT NOW, or --
>
> Sam: Dean --
>
> Dean: What?!

(The argument is abruptly paused here because they just run into something supernatural and just have to start working the case.)

(About why Dean comes to find Sam from school after Dad died. The last scene is a shot of Dad's journal's last page --)

> Dean, ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME, FIND SAM. WATCH OUT FOR YOUR BROTHER. NOTHING'S MORE IMPORTANT. IT'S COMING FOR HIM.
