The phone rings in his trench coat pocket. Castiel answers at the second ring. "Hello?" It can only be one of the Winchester brothers.

"Cas?" Sam says, and then hesitates.

Cas notices, immediately on alert, "Sam? Is everything ok?"

"Yeah, yeah, Cas. Everything's fine." Sam rushes through words, "Great, even, all things considered."

Cas squints at the tree in front of him. He can hear the hesitation, the same way Sam would always be when he tries to hide something but feels bad about it. After more than a decade, Castiel thinks he can finally understand some human subtlety.

"Sam?"

"Look, man, I know it must sound silly," Sam's voice sounds... is that embarrassment? "But it's Dean's birthday tomorrow, it would be nice if you can swing by."

Cas thinks about today's date, does the math, and calculates the cycles of the Sun and the Moon again to doublecheck. "No, I don't think it is." he says.

Sam's chuckle passes through the phone line. "Yeah I know, it isn't, but it is now. And yesterday was mine, the day before yesterday was Thanksgiving, and we had Christmas last Friday."

Cas squints harder at the tree trunk.

"There's this woman in the bunker now, kinda like a butler. And she's cool --"

"What woman?"

"Some Man of Letter thing, a wood nymph, she said, we don't know much but she looks fine, and takes care of us -- Just... come by if you can, okay? We'll have the birthday hat and cake and candle-blowing, the whole set. He would like you here, Cas, I know he would." Sam says, voice urgent and sincere.

And Cas knows he's right.

"Okay," he nods, even though Sam can't see across the phone, "I'll be there tomorrow."

He's half a country away from Kansas. But a night's drive is nothing, thinking about what's waiting.

<br>

Dean wakes up to the amazing breakfast smell by his bedside. He gets confused for a second, then seeing Mrs. Butters right by his side he remembers.

"Breakfast on bed," he beams, "now we're talking."

The omelet is perfectly golden and wrapped, the coffee is steaming hot with the right amount of bitterness and some kind of deep baked wooden smell -- wood nymph, no kidding. There are even slices of breakfast fruits with syrup sprinkled on it.

Dean takes a bite on the omelet, feeling the soft mixtures on his tongue, letting out a sigh of satisfaction. "I'm so corrupted." Who knows birthday can be so good? Not like they had any.

<br>

Sam keeps glancing at the bunker door. It's around noon now. Maybe Cas is busy? With the real important stuff, instead of whatever retirement life they're having. Sam frowns, only hoping it's not something nasty that keeps Cas occupied.

"You expecting someone?" Dean studies his face.

"What? No, nothing." Sam smooths his brow and puts on his most innocent face -- too innocent that it surely can't cover anything. "A delivery," he manages to improvise, like he always does whenever his cover is blown in a case, "personal, stuff. You wouldn't want to know."

Dean pulls a face, doesn't push, just walks away.

<br>

The doorbell rings when the dinner is ready. Sam jumps to his feet but Dean beats him. Cas's hand is still by the bell when Dean pulls the door open.

"Hello, Dean." he greets.

"Cas." Dean throws a brow from over the shoulder at Sam, "Delivery? Cas is your delivery?"

Cas opens his mouth, but Sam coughs loud before he can speak. "Uh, why don't you, em, come and sit. Dinner is getting cold."

Dean looks at him pointedly, but lets him go.

Looking back, Cas still stands in his usual stiff straight stance, Dean lets out a small smile. Patting on Cas's shoulder once, he says "Glad you're back home." and heads to the dinner table.

*Home.*

Cas follows him inside, with Mrs. Butters' eyes picking on his every step.

<br>

The dinner is amazing, just like the rest of food ever served by Mrs. Butters. But it is no match to the dessert. When the cake-slash-pie comes to the table, Dean stares. "You can do that?"

"Dude, you're drooling." Sam pulls a disgusting face.

"This is a cake-pie! A pie-cake!" Dean gestures to the plate with both palms in awe. The pie-cake has a crossed crust decorated with butter cream and chocolate, painted beautifully into the shape of impala and his name initials "DW", sided with Rice Krispie treats that he has wanted for a long while. In the center, pierced right through the stuffing, a single candle that is far too colorful for the room and can only be found in a six-year-old's birthday party is already lit. Dean doesn't mind it makes chocolate melting a little.

"Wish time." Sam grins, putting an equally colorful paper birthday tiara on his head.

Cas turns off the lights in the room.

With candle's light, Dean looks around. Sam is by his side, Cas across the table, next to Jack. For this moment, the world feels far away, what he has in the room is everything that ever existed.

Dean drops his head and closes his eyes, thinking about a wish, feeling soft and fulfilled for the first time in a long time. His muscles relax. Candle's flame flickers on the eyelid, leaving the dark vision red and warm on the edge. He focuses on the faces passing through in that red vision, the faces he remembers, the people he knows, the friends and family he has.

Dean Winchester makes a wish and blows the candle.

Sam claps, Cas follows, Jack the last.

"Crap, we forget the birthday song." Sam suddenly remembers as he's still clapping, jumping on his feet.

"Spare me a minute, will ya?" Dean says, complaining tone but not much of the face, still enjoying the moment.

Sam wants to argue, catching Cas's eyes, falling silent and sitting back.

"Is it gift time now?" Cas asks.

Dean looks at him, surprised, "You got me gifts?"

"Not just me." Cas shifts in his seat, uncharacteristically shy.

Dean raises a brow, "Alright, you got my attention, Cas. What is it?"

Cas reaches inside his coat, taking out something wrapped in gift paper with exaggerated green and blue patterns, something thick cubic looking.

"More books?" Dean guesses, "You guys are really super nerdy, you know that?"

Cas doesn't say a thing, his eyes locked on his fingers, handing the thing over.

The wrapping paper is easy enough to tear apart. The inside makes Dean gasp.

He's right about it being a book, sort of. But he totally didn't expect this.

It's a photobook. Or rather, a family photobook.

There are photos of his grandparents, the Campbells and the Winchesters when they were younger. Photos of John and Mary holding hands, smiling sweet, the shots taken from the back and the side, as young as they look when he time travels back.

Then there are photos of himself, from a toddler to kid, from teenager to the real hunter. He scans through, seeing himself from chubby little "wuv hugz" kid to slim boy with ridiculous hair, holding a hand towards a high school age hot girl. Some he remembers, some he doesn't. Some good quality with him looking back at himself, some are more like street cam zoomed in.

He swallows hard, easing the feelings, looking up and crashing into Cas's intense eyes that are still locked onto him.

"Where did you get these?" He asks, in a voice way huskier than he expected.

"I asked around." Cas answers, a tiny little uneasily, "There are still some hunters kicking around knowing you and your brother since before you were born. And some other... passersby still remembers you."

"People we saved, you mean," Dean clarifies. Cas nods.

"You can't possibly get all those gathered in a day, not even when you could still fly around." Dean feels his eyes burning, he blinks hard, "How long have you been doing this?"

"Been a while."

"And you go to so many people, go through all these trouble, for -- for what? Giving me a birthday gift on a day that isn't even my birthday?"

Cas nods quietly again, then adds, "Well, it's not my idea to start with," he tilts his head slightly towards Sam's direction, "your brother did."

Dean gives both of them a quick glance, the burning feeling at the back of his eyes spread to the corner. He pinches his ridge, taking in a breath, "Of course you do, both of you, plotting against my back again? Thought we agreed to *not* do that again."

They can't see his face, not exactly. And the tone... doesn't exactly sound happy. Cas falls into silence again. Slightly more stiff even, in the way he sits.

Sam bites hard, starting to get pissed off, "Just for once, can you at least appreciate the effort? Do you have any idea how much it takes for Cas to drive around, locate all those people from all the years ago to gather things around?"

"You mean that's what he's been doing with all those time that could have been used to find and fight Chuck?"

"Dean --"

"Sam, it's ok." Cas murmurs, in an even lower voice than usual, "Dean, I was just thinking, normal kids -- people -- sometimes would have a yearly birthday photobook. Every year at birthday time, parents bring them to take a photo at the same place as they grow up. And I think -- I thought -- you and Sam didn't have much chance to celebrate birthdays, let alone keeping photos. Just thought it could make up some... um, make you --" happy. But for some reason, that word stuck at his throat, refusing to come out. "-- never mind, then." he sighs.

"Happy birthday, Dean." Cas wraps quickly, giving Dean a flashing smile, something reflective in his eyes, about to turn around from the table. Cake untouched.

Sam and Jack murmur the same quick "happy birthday".

"Cas --" Dean calls after him, hurries around the table to stand in his way out.

He looks into Cas's eyes, holds there, the look so intense it might break into sparkles.

Dean gives out a long sigh eventually, pulling Cas into a clumsy hug and murmurs a small "I'm sorry, Cas" barely inches away from his ear.

"I just --" he chokes, "-- don't think I'm worthy of all that --" he doesn't say all that what, but he doesn't need to.

Cas holds him tight. "Yes, you are, Dean." he tells him. "You are."

Dean has to close his eyes tight to squeeze the wetness out. "Thank you." he says, then a second time, "Thank you, Cas, for the gift and everything." For being here all the time, birthday or not. He thinks loud.

<br>

Sam and Jack get their hugs too, later. Mostly rough bumping into shoulders kind. Sam winks at Jack, "It's like those buy-one-get-two-free type of on-sale discounts."

He steals a glance at Cas, wandering around the room now, visibly more relaxed, whispering to the kid, "At least now we can have a good guess what Dean's birthday wish is."

<br>

His birthday wish is *certainly* not being chased down the hallway by a lunatic wood nymph. People just can't always get what they want, isn't it? Dean thinks absent-mindedly.

"Dean, careful!" Cas yells from behind him, Dean dodges a wave of magic attack.

The nymph -- Mrs. Butters -- shines her evil green eyes, closing in on him and choking him out of air, saying angrily in a hissing sound, "They're not human! You're surrounded by too much evil you can't tell right and wrong now, Dean Winchester, legacy of Man of Letters. I'm helping you, removing the evil in your life, Lucifer's son and the fallen angel."

The magical power confining Cas must be hurting him in some invisible way, the angel grinds his teeth and apparently tries his very hardest to not let out any groan. His eyes saying nothing but "Go, take care of yourself."

But this is his birthday, Dean thinks, and starts getting pissed off. Real or fake, this is his birthday, and nothing should mess him around on this day. He shoots at the old woman-shaped nymph -- which doesn't even slow her down -- and then salts and burns the cane -- with Sam dashed in at the last minute to help -- finally, all things fall into old order again. No more magic home-cooked meals, no more magical fresh clean clothes or wiped-clean bunker room.

"It's like Cinderella." Dean thinks about it, looking around the bunker, amused, "After midnight, everything goes back to what they're before. Carriage the pumpkin, servants the mice, a long great dream waking up."

"And Dean the Cinderella." Sam laughs, busy cleaning up the mess on the floor. "At least we got some part of your birthday right?"

Dean barks out a laughter, "Oh totally. Handling a murderous nymph after the cake? Story of my life."

"Not a bad one I hope?" Cas observes them.

"Not bad at all." Dean agrees, looking at him, "At least for today."
