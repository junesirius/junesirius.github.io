The phone rings in his trench coat pocket. Castiel answers at the second ring. It can only be one of the Winchester brothers. "Hello?"

"Cas?" Sam says, and then hesitates.

Cas notices, immediately on alert, "Sam? Is everything ok?"

"Yeah, yeah, Cas. Everything's fine." Sam rushes through words, "Great, even, all things considered."

Cas squints at the tree in front of him. He can hear the hesitation, the same way Sam would always be when he tries to hide something but feels bad about it. After more than a decade, Castiel thinks he can finally understand some human subtlety.

"Sam?"

"Look, man, I know it must sound silly," Sam's voice sounds... is that embarrassment? "But it's Dean's birthday tomorrow, it would be nice if you can swing by."

Cas thinks about today's date, does the math, and calculates the cycles of the Sun and the Moon again to doublecheck. "No, I don't think it is." he says.

Sam's chuckle passes through the phone line. "Yeah I know, it isn't, but it is now. And yesterday was mine, the day before yesterday was Thanksgiving, and we had Christmas last Friday."

Cas squints harder at the tree trunk.

"There is this woman in the bunker now, kinda like a butler. And she's cool --"

"What woman?"

"Some Man of Letter thing, a wood nymph, she said, we don't know much but she looks fine, and takes care of us -- Just... come by if you can, okay? We'll have the birthday hat and cake and candle-blowing, the whole set. He would like you here, Cas, I know he would." Sam says, voice urgent and sincere.

And Cas knows he's right.

"Okay," he nods, even though Sam can't see across the phone, "I'll be there tomorrow."

He's half a country away from Kansas, a night's drive is nothing.

<br>

Dean wakes up to the amazing breakfast smell by his bedside. He gets confused for a second, then seeing Mrs. Butters right by his side he remembers.

"Breakfast on bed," he beams, "now we're talking."

The omelet is perfectly golden and wrapped, the coffee is steaming hot with the right amount of bitterness and some kind of deep wooden smell -- wood nymph, no kidding. There are even slices of breakfast fruits with syrup sprinkled on it.

Dean takes a bite on the omelet, feeling the soft mixtures on his tongue, letting out a sigh of satisfaction. "I'm so corrupted." Who knows birthday can be so good?

<br>

Sam keeps glancing at the bunker door. It's around noon now. Maybe Cas is busy? With the real important stuff, instead of whatever retirement life they're having. Sam frowns, only hoping it's not something nasty that keeps Cas occupied.

"You expecting someone?" Dean studies his face.

"What? No, nothing." Sam smooths his brow and puts on his most innocent face -- too innocent that it surely can't cover anything. "A delivery," he manages to improvise, like he always do whenever his cover is blown in a case, "personal, stuff. You wouldn't want to know."

Dean pulls a face, doesn't push, and walks away.

<br>

The doorbell rings when the dinner is ready. Sam jumps to his feet but Dean is faster. Cas's hand is still by the bell when Dean pulls the door open.

"Hello, Dean." he greets.

"Cas." Dean throws a brow from across the shoulder at Sam, "Delivery? Cas is your delivery?"

Cas opens his mouth, but Sam coughs loud before he can speak. "Uh, why don't you, em, come and sit. Dinner is getting cold."

Dean looks at him pointedly, but lets him go.

Looking back, Cas still stands in his usual stiff straight stance, Dean lets out a small smile. Patting on Cas's shoulder once, he says "Glad you're back home." and heads to the dinner table.

Cas follows, with Mrs. Butters' eyes following his every step.

<br>

The dinner is amazing, just like the rest of food ever provided by Mrs. Butters. But it is no match to the dessert. When the cake-slash-pie comes to the table, Dean stares. "You can do that?"

"Dude, you're drooling." Sam pulls a disgusting face.

"This is a cake-pie! A pie-cake!" Dean gestures the plates with both palms in awe. The pie-cake has a crossed crust decorated with butter cream and chocolate, painted beautifully into the shape of impala and his name initials "DW", sided with Rice Krispie treats that he has wanted for a long while. In the center right pierced through the stuffing, a single colorful lit candle that can only be seen from a six-year-old's birthday party. Dean doesn't mind.

"Make a wish, Dean." Mrs. Butters says, from across the table.

With candle's light, Dean looks around. Sam is by his side, Cas across the table, next to Jack. Dean drops his head and closes his eyes, thinking about a wish, feeling soft and fulfilled for the first time in a long time. Candle's light flickering on the eyelid, leaving the vision red. He focuses on the faces flashing in that red vision, the faces he remembers, the people he knows.

Dean Winchester makes a wish and blows the candle.

Sam claps, Cas follows, Jack the last.

"Damn, we forget the birthday song and hat." Sam suddenly remembers as he's still clapping, jumping on his feet.

"Spare me a minute, will ya?" Dean says, complaining tone but not much of the face, still enjoying the moment.

Sam wants to argue, catching Cas's eyes, falling silent and sitting back.

"Is it gift time now?" Cas asks.

Dean looks at him, surprised, "You got me gifts?"

"Not just me." Cas shifts in his seat, uncharacteristically shy.

Dean raises a brow, "Alright, you got my attention, Cas. What is it?"

Cas reaches inside his coat, taking out something wrapped in gift paper with exaggerated green and blue patterns, something thick cubic looking.

"More books?" Dean guesses, "You guys are really super nerdy, you know that?"

Cas doesn't say a thing, his eyes locked on him, handing the thing over.

The wrapping paper is easy enough to tear apart. The inside makes Dean gasp.

He's right about it being a book, sort of. But he totally didn't expect this.

It's a photobook. Or rather, a family photobook.

There are photos of his grandparents, the Campbells and the Winchesters when they were young. Photos of John and Mary holding hands, the shots taken from the back and the side. Then there are photos of himself, from a toddler to kid, from teenager to the real hunter. He scans through, seeing himself in chubby little "want a hug" sweater to slim boy with ridiculous hair, holding a hand to a high school girl. Some he remembers, some he doesn't.

He swallows hard, easing the feelings, looking up and crashing into Cas's intense eyes that are still locked onto him.

"Where did you get these?" He asked, in a voice way lighter than he expected.

"I asked around." Cas answers, a tiny little uneasily, "There are still some hunters kicking around knowing you and your brother since before you were born. And some other... passersby still remembers you."

"People we saved, you mean," Dean clarifies. Cas nods.

"And you go to so many people, go through all these trouble, for -- for what? Giving me a birthday gift on a day that isn't even my birthday?"

Cas nods again, then adds, "Well, it's not my idea to start with," he tilts his head slightly towards Sam's direction, "your brother did."

Dean gives both of them a quick glance, "Of course you do, both of you, plotting against my back again? Thought we agreed don't do that again."

Cas falls into silence again. Slightly more stiff even, in the way he sits. Sam defends, pissed off, "Just for once, can you at least appreciate the effort? Cas had to drive the whole night and most of today to gather things around, the least you can say is 'Thank you'."

Cas murmurs, in a low voice, "I was just thinking, normal kids sometimes would have a yearly birthday photobook. Every year at birthday time, parents take them to take a photo at the same place as they grow up. And I think -- I thought -- you and Sam didn't have much chance to celebrate birthdays, let alone keeping photos. Just thought it could make you --" happy. But for some reason, he just feel the word stuck at his throat, refusing to come out.

"Happy birthday, Dean." Cas finishes, giving Dean a small smile, something reflective in his eyes.

Sam and Jack say the same.

Dean looks into Cas's eyes, holds there, the look so intense it might break into sparkles. Then Sam's and Jack's, all a little unsure.

Dean gives out a long sigh, pulling Cas into a hug and murmurs a small "It's ok. Thank you, Cas." barely inches from his ear. Cas holds him tight, before letting him go.

Sam and Jack get their hugs too, but as Sam comments later, "These are more like buy-one-get-two-free kind of deals." he steals a glance at the Kid, and keeps talking, "Well, at least now we know for sure what's his birthday wish."

<br>

His birthday wish is the world peace, not being chased down the hall way by a lunatic wood nymph. Dean thinks absent-mindedly.

"Dean, careful!" Cas yells from behind him, Dean dodges a wave of magic attack.

The nymph -- Mrs. Butters -- shines her evil green eyes, closing in on him and choking him out of air, saying angrily in a hissing sound, "They're not human! You're surrounded by too much evil you can't tell right and wrong now, Dean Winchester, legacy of Man of Letters. I'm helping you, removing the evil in your life, Lucifer's son and the fallen angel."

The magical power holding Cas still must be hurting him in some way, the angel grinds his teeth and apparently tries his very hardest to not let out any groan. His eyes saying nothing but "Go, take care of yourself."

But this is his birthday, Dean thinks, and starts getting pissed off. This is his birthday, and nothing should mess him around in this day. He shoots the old woman-shaped nympy -- which doesn't even slow her down -- and then salts and burns the cane -- with dashed-in Sam's skills -- finally, all things fall into old order again.

"It's almost like Cinderella." Dean thinks about it, looking around the bunker, amused, "After midnight, everything goes back to what they're before. A long great dream wake up."

Sam nods, "At least we got your birthday part right. Partially."

Dean barks out a laugh, "Oh totally. Handling a murderous nympy after the cake? Most normal birthday ever."

"And the best one I hope?" Cas asks.

"I hope so." Dean nods.
