The phone rings in his trench coat pocket. Castiel answers on the second ring. "Hello?" It can only be one of the Winchester brothers.

"Cas?" Sam says, and then hesitates.

Cas notices, immediately on alert, "Sam? Is everything ok?"

"Yeah, yeah, Cas. Everything's fine." Sam rushes through words, "Great, even, all things considered."

Cas squints at the tree in front of him. He can hear the hesitation, the same way Sam would always be when he tries to hide something but feels bad about it. After more than a decade, Castiel thinks he can finally start to pick up on some of these human subtleties.

"Sam?"

"Look, man, I know it must sound silly," Sam's voice sounds... is that embarrassment? "But it's Dean's birthday tomorrow, it'd be nice if you could swing by."

Cas thinks about today's date, does the math, and calculates the cycles of the sun and the moon again to double-check. "No, I don't think it is," he says.

Sam's chuckle passes through the phone line. "Yeah I know, it's not, but it is now. And yesterday was mine, the day before yesterday was Thanksgiving, and we had Christmas last Friday."

Cas squints harder at the tree trunk.

"There's this woman in the bunker now, kinda like a butler. And she's cool --"

"What woman?"

"Some Man of Letter thing. A wood nymph, she said. We don't know much but she looks fine, and, well... she's been taking care of us. So just... come by if you can, okay? We'd have birthday hats and cake and candles, the whole deal. He would like you here, Cas, I know he would." Sam says, voice urgent and sincere.

And Cas knows he's right.

"Okay," he nods, even though Sam can't see across the phone, "I'll be there tomorrow."

He's half a country away from Kansas. But a night's drive is nothing, not when it's coming home.

<br>

Dean wakes up to the amazing breakfast smell by his bedside. He gets confused for a moment, then spotting Mrs. Butters right by his side brings everything back..

"Breakfast on the bed," he beams. "Now we're talking."

The omelet is perfectly golden and folded, the coffee is steaming hot with the right amount of bitterness and some kind of deep-baked wooden smell -- wood nymph, no kidding. There are even slices of breakfast fruits with syrup drizzled on them.

Dean takes a bite of the omelet, savoring the soft mixture on his tongue, letting out a sigh of satisfaction. "I'm so corrupted." Who knew birthdays could be this good? Not like they ever had any.

<br>

Sam keeps glancing at the bunker door. It's around noon now. Maybe Cas is busy? With the real important stuff, instead of whatever retirement life they're coasting through. Sam frowns, only hoping it's not something nasty that keeps Cas occupied.

"You expecting someone?" Dean studies his face.

"What? No, nothing." Sam smooths his brow and puts on his most innocent face -- too innocent that it surely can't cover anything. "A delivery," he manages to improvise, like he always does whenever his cover is blown in a case. "Personal, stuff. You wouldn't want to know."

Dean pulls a face, doesn't push, just walks away.

<br>

The doorbell rings when the dinner is ready. Sam jumps to his feet but Dean beats him. Cas's hand is still by the bell when Dean pulls the door open.

"Hello, Dean." he greets.

"Cas." Dean throws a bro, glancing over his shoulder at Sam, "Delivery? Cas is your delivery?"

Cas opens his mouth, but Sam coughs loudly before he can speak. "Uh, why don't you, em, come in and sit. Dinner is getting cold."

Dean looks at him pointedly, but lets him go.

Looking back, Cas still stands in his usual stiff straight stance, Dean lets out a small smile. Patting Cas on the shoulder once, he says "Glad you're back home." and heads to the dinner table.

*Home.*

Cas follows him inside, with Mrs. Butters' eyes picking on his every step.

<br>

The dinner is amazing, just like the rest of the food ever served by Mrs. Butters. But it is no match to the dessert. When the cake-slash-pie comes to the table, Dean stares. "You can do *that*?"

"Dude, you're drooling." Sam pulls a disgusting face.

"This is a *cake-pie*! A *pie-cake*!" Dean gestures at the plate with both palms in awe. The pie-cake has a crossed crust decorated with butter cream and chocolate, painted beautifully into the shape of impala and his name initials "DW", surrounded by Rice Krispie treats that he has wanted for a long while. In the center, pierced right through the stuffing, a single candle that is far too colorful for the room and can only be found at a six-year-old's birthday party is already lit. Dean doesn't mind it makes chocolate melt a little.

"Wish time." Sam grins, putting an equally colorful paper birthday tiara on his head.

Cas turns off the lights in the room.

In the candle's flickering light, Dean looks around. Sam is by his side, Cas across the table, next to Jack. For this moment, the world feels far away, what he has here in the room is everything that ever existed.

Dean lowers his head and closes his eyes, thinking about a wish, feeling soft and fulfilled for the first time in a long time. His muscles relax, his mind stills. The candle's flame flickers on the eyelid, leaving the dark vision red and warm on the edges. He focuses on the faces passing through in that red vision, the faces he remembers, the people he knows, the friends and family he has.

Dean Winchester makes his wish and blows out the candle.

Sam claps, Cas follows, Jack the last.

"Crap, we forgot the birthday song." Sam suddenly remembers as he's still clapping, jumping to his feet.

"Spare me a minute, will ya?" Dean says, complaining tone but not much of a bitch face, still enjoying the moment too much.

Sam wants to argue, catching Cas's eyes, falling silent and sitting back.

"Is it gift time now?" Cas asks.

Dean turns to him, surprised, "You got me a gift?"

"Not just me." Cas shifts in his seat, uncharacteristically shy.

Dean raises a brow, "Alright, you got my attention, Cas. What is it?"

Cas reaches inside his coat, pulling out something wrapped in gift paper with exaggerated green and blue patterns, something thick cubic looking.

"More books?" Dean guesses, "You guys are really super nerdy, you know that?"

Cas doesn't say a thing, his eyes locked on Dean, handing the thing over.

The wrapping paper is easy enough to tear apart. The inside makes Dean gasp.

He's right about it being a book, sort of. But he totally didn't expect this.

It's a photobook. Or rather, a family photobook.

There are photos of his grandparents, the Campbells and the Winchesters in their younger days. Photos of John and Mary holding hands, smiling toothachingly sweetly, as young as they look when he time travels back. The shots taken from their back and sides, hidden views.

Then there are photos of himself, from a toddler to a kid, then a teenager to a real hunter. All about him. Too much about him.

He scans through, seeing himself from the chubby little "wuv hugz" kid to the slim boy with ridiculous hair, holding a hand towards a high school-age hot girl. Some he remembers, some he doesn't. Some good quality with him looking back at himself, some are more like street cam zoomed in.

He swallows hard, chest tightening. Looking up, he crashes into Cas's intense eyes that are still locked onto him.

"Where did you get these?" He asks, in a voice way huskier than he intended.

"I asked around." Cas answers, a tiny little uneasily, "There are still some hunters kicking around knowing you and your family since before you were born. And some other... passersby still remember you."

"People we saved, you mean," Dean clarifies. Cas nods.

"You can't possibly get all those gathered in a day, not even back when you could still fly around." Dean feels his eyes burning, he blinks hard, "How long have you been doing this?"

"Been a while."

"And you went to so many people, went through all this trouble, for -- for what? Giving me a birthday gift on a day that isn't even my birthday?"

Cas nods quietly again, then adds, "Well, it's not my idea to start with," he tilts his head slightly in Sam's direction, "your brother did."

Dean gives both of them a quick glance, the burning feeling at the back of his eyes spread to the corner. He pinches the bridge of his nose, taking a sharp breath, "Of course you did, both of you, plotting against my back again? Thought we agreed to *not* do that again."

They can't see his face, not exactly. And the tone... doesn't exactly sound happy. Cas falls into complete silence again. Slightly more stiff even, in the way he sits.

Sam bites hard, starting to get pissed off, "Just for once, can you at least *not* be an ass and appreciate the effort? You have any idea how much it took for Cas to drive around, track down all those people from years ago to collect things together?"

"You mean that's what he's been doing with all that time that could have been used to find and stop Chuck?"

"Dean --"

"Sam, it's ok." Cas murmurs, in an even lower voice than usual, "Dean, I was just thinking, normal kids -- normal people -- sometimes have yearly birthday photobooks. Every year around birthday time, parents take them for a photo at the same place as they grow up. And I think -- I thought -- you and Sam didn't have much of a chance to celebrate birthdays, let alone keep photos. Just thought it could maybe make up some... um, make you --" happy. But for some reason, that word sticks at his throat, refusing to come out. "-- never mind, then." he sighs.

"Happy birthday, Dean." He offers quickly at the end, tone resigned, giving Dean a fleeting smile, something reflective in his eyes, and about to turn away from the table. Cake untouched.

Sam and Jack echo the same quick, quiet "Happy birthday".

"Cas --" Dean calls after him, hurries around the table to stand in his way out.

He looks into Cas's eyes, holds there, the look so intense it might break into sparks.

Dean gives out a long sigh eventually, pulling Cas into a clumsy hug and murmurs a small "I'm sorry, Cas" barely inches away from his ear.

"I just --" he chokes, "-- don't think I deserve all this --" he doesn't say all this *what*, but he doesn't need to.

Cas holds him tight. "Yes, you do, Dean." he tells him. "You do."

Dean has to close his eyes tight to squeeze the wetness out. "Thank you." he says, then a second time, "Thank you, Cas, for the gift and everything." For being here all the time, birthday or not. He thinks aloud.

<br>

Sam and Jack get their hugs too, later. Mostly rough bumping into shoulders kind. Sam winks at Jack, "It's like one of those buy-one-get-two-free deals."

He steals a glance at Cas, now wandering around the room, visibly more relaxed. "At least now we can have a good guess what Dean's birthday wish was."

<br>

His birthday wish is *certainly* not being chased down the hallway by a lunatic wood nymph. But hey, people just don't always get what they want, do they? Dean thinks absentmindedly.

"Dean, careful!" Cas yells from behind him, Dean dodges a wave of magic attack.

The nymph -- Mrs. Butters -- her evil green eyes glowing, closing in on him and choking him out of the air, hissing angrily, "They're not human! You're surrounded by too much evil you can't tell right and wrong now, Dean Winchester, legacy of Man of Letters. I'm helping you, getting rid of the evil in your life, Lucifer's son and the fallen angel."

The magical power confining Cas must be hurting him in some invisible way, he grits his teeth and apparently tries his very hardest to not let out any groan to distract Dean. Their eyes meet and Cas's eyes pleading nothing but "Go, save yourself."

But this is his birthday and he's had enough. Dean thinks, and starts getting pissed off. Real or fake, this is his birthday, and nothing should mess with him on this day. He gets so pissed off that he manages to struggle off the grasp, dives for his gun and shoots at the old woman-shaped nymph -- which doesn't even slow her down but Cas shakes free -- and then salts and burns the cane -- with Sam dashed in at the last minute to help find her weakness -- finally, all things fall into old order again. No more magic home-cooked meals, no more magically fresh laundry or self-cleaning bunker room. Everything's back to normal -- or at least as normal as their lives get.

"It's like Cinderella," Dean thinks about it, looking around the bunker, amused. "After midnight, everything goes back to the way it was before. Carriage the pumpkin, servants the mice, a long great dream waking up."

"And Dean the Cinderella." Sam teases, busy cleaning up the messes on the floor. "At least we got some parts of your birthday right, yeah?"

Dean barks out a laugh. "Oh totally. A homicidal nymph after the birthday cake? Sounds about right. Story of my life."

"Not a bad story, I hope?" Cas interjects, watching him closely.

Dean glances at him, his expression softening. "Not bad at all," he admits. "At least, not today."
