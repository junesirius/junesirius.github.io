> *INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY*
>
> Crowley: Dean? Deeeean?
>
> Crowley looks around. Out of nowhere a gun fires, and Crowley collapses against a wall, unable to move, holding his hand over where the bullet entered. Sam emerges from the shadows.
>
> Sam: Devil's trap bullet.
>
> Crowley: Moose! Shooting me from behind. Poor form, even for you. Where's Dean?
>
> Sam: Not here.
>
> Crowley: He called me.
>
> Sam: Did he?
>
> Sam pulls out his phone and plays a recording of Dean saying "Hey, I need your help."
>
> Crowley: Oh. Aren't you a clever kitty? Does he know you're doing this? <u>I only ask because your brother and I, such close friends now.</u>
>
> Sam: Friends. You're the reason Dean has the Mark of Cain! Everything that's happening! All of this. It's your fault! So this.... you've had this coming for a long time.
>
> Crowley sees that Sam is holding Ruby's knife.
>
> Crowley: You really think I'm frightened of that toothpick?
>
> Sam: I don't care.
>
> Sam reaches into his pocket and pulls out a hex bag. He puts it in Crowley's pocket.
>
> Crowley: A hex bag?
>
> Sam: By the way. She said to tell you, she should have taken the three pigs.
>
> Crowley: Mother!
>
> <u>All of a sudden Crowley tenses up in pain, eyes wide. He slides down the wall and falls onto the floor, unable to breathe, coughing blood. Sam stands over him, unemotional.</u>

> Crowley: I thought you were the smart one. Working with my mother. Are you insane! You actually trust her?
>
> Sam: 'Course not. Not even a little.
>
> Crowley: Then why? What has she got over you?
>
> Sam: Will you just die already?
>
> Crowley: (coughs, spits blood) That's what I get.
>
> Sam: What?
>
> Crowley: I said, that's what I get for trying to be the good guy.
>
> Sam: Wait a second, so you're the good guy?
>
> Crowley: <u>Do you have any idea what I've been at for the past year? The changes I made to hell!</u>
>
> Sam: Am I supposed to be impressed by that?
>
> Crowley: <u>Yes! (coughs up more blood) I thought if I did better, I might actually feel something again. That it might matter.</u>
>
> Sam: It doesn't matter. Maybe everybody else forgot about all the bad you've done, but I haven't! I have watched you kill people, Crowley. Innocent people! People I cared about, people I loved! <u>So yeah, you have the accent, and the suit, and the snark, but at the end of it, you are a monster! Just like all the rest of them. And I'm gonna watch you die, screaming. Just like all the rest of them.</u>
>
> Crowley: You're right. I am a monster. And I've done bad. I've done things you can't even imagine. Horrible, evil, messy things.
>
> Crowley coughs, then turns his head to look up at Sam. His eyes have turned a dark red, and red smoke seems to be emanating from them.
>
> Crowley: And I've loved every. Damn. Minute.
>
> Sam looks at him, confused, worried. Crowley pulls the bullet out from his wound, and stands up.
>
> Crowley: So thank you Sam. For reminding me who I really am.
>
> Crowley flicks his hand sideways and sends Sam flying across the room, smashing through glass windows into the next room. Crowley walks over to Sam, holding the hex bag.
>
> Crowley: <u>Powerful magic. Might have worked on any other demon. But me? Please.</u>
>
> From the ground, Sam watches as the hex bag bursts into flames. He sees Ruby's knife on the ground and tries to reach it, but Crowley sends it flying away with a wave of his hand. <u>Crowley stands over Sam, with his fingers ready to make a snapping motion. Sam watches him, defenseless, waiting.</u>
>
> Crowley: I could kill you. Snap my fingers, easiest thing in the world.
>
> <u>Crowley lowers his hand.</u>
>
> Crowley: <u>From here on, I want you to know that the only reason you're alive is because I allowed it.</u> And I want you to deliver a message. You tell that ginger whore that I gave her a chance to walk away and she spat in my face. So now, she'll never see me coming.
>
> Crowley vanishes, leaving Sam alone.

> Castiel: Dean!
>
> Dean turns to face Castiel.
>
> Castiel: What have you done?
>
> Castiel kneels by Cyrus' body.
>
> Castiel: You killed him.
>
> Dean: I took down a monster. Because that's what I do. And I'll continue to do that until...
>
> Castiel: Until you become the monster.
>
> Dean: You can leave now, Cass.
>
> Castiel: <u>No. I can't. Because I'm your friend.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Really? Well let me ask you something. Do you screw over all your friends?</u>
>
> Castiel: Sam and I were trying to cure you! We still are!
>
> Dean: Like hell.
>
> Castiel: We can read the Book now.
>
> Dean: Oh so what? So you *MIGHT* find a spell that *MIGHT* take this crap off my arm? But even if you do, what's it gonna cost? 'Cause magic like that does not come free. No, it comes with a price that you pay in blood. So thanks, but I'm good.
>
> <u>Dean turns to leave. Castiel grabs his shoulder to stop him.</u>
>
> Castiel: No! You're not. <u>Maybe you could fight the Mark for years. Maybe centuries, like Cain did. But you cannot fight it forever. And when you finally turn, and you will turn... Sam, and everyone you know, everyone you love... they could be long dead. Everyone except me. I'm the one who will have to watch you murder the world. So if there's even a small chance that we can save you, I won't let you walk out of this room.</u>
>
> Dean: Oh you think you have a choice.
>
> Castiel: I think the Mark is changing you.
>
> Dean: You're wrong.
>
> Castiel: Am I? Because the Dean Winchester I know would never have murdered that kid.
>
> Dean: Yeah well, that Dean's always been kind of a dick.
>
> <u>Dean tries to leave again, but Castiel stops him.</u>
>
> Castiel: Dean. <u>I don't wanna have to hurt you.</u>
>
> Dean: I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
>
> <u>Dean grabs Castiel's hand and wrenches it off of his shoulder, then punches him hard in the face with his other hand.</u>
>
> <u>Castiel: Dean.</u>
>
> <u>Dean punches Castiel over and over, then throws him on the floor. Castiel, bloody, gets up, still trying to stop Dean from leaving.</u>
>
> <u>Castiel: Dean. Stop.</u>
>
> <u>Dean, halfway to the doorway, turns around and launches a new attack on Castiel, beating him up worse than before. As Castiel lies on the floor, half conscious and coughing up blood, Dean pulls the angel blade from Castiel's coat. He grabs his tie and prepares to stab him. Castiel manages to grab Dean's hand.</u>
>
> <u>Castiel: No, Dean. Please. (He coughs and blood comes up)</u>
>
> <u>Dean stares coldly at Castiel, holding the angel blade. Dean strikes with the angel blade, and stands up. A shot of Castiel reveals that Dean has stabbed a book next to Castiel's face.</u>
>
> Dean: (walking away) You and Sam stay the hell away from me. <u>Next time I won't miss.</u>
>
> <u>Castiel, still on the floor, watches Dean leave in horror.</u>

> The scene changes to the outdoors. A large bowl is on the ground. A flame flashes brightly and then burns out. Castiel is pacing and looking around. An overhead views shows he is at a crossroads. In the center he has drawn some symbols and the bowl is in the middle. Crowley approaches, sighing
>
> Crowley: <u>Who summons anymore? Couldn't you call?</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>You're not in my contacts list.</u>
>
> Crowley: What?
>
> Castiel: I need your assistance to help cure Dean of the Mark.
>
> Crowley: What's the expression? I gave at the office? Maybe I'd feel a little different if Sam Winchester hadn't just tried to bloody kill me! (raises voice in Crowley 'signature yell')
>
> Castiel: I'm afraid "no" is not an acceptable answer.
>
> Crowley: Or what?
>
> Castiel: Or...
>
> Castiel raises his hand in front of Crowley's face and concentrates intently.
>
> Crowley: That's right. Burn those eyes blue. Spread those broken wings and destroy me! Or...Do it my way. (Castiel lowers his hand) Right. Now beg.
>
> Castiel: What?
>
> Crowley: Blast me, or beg.
>
> Castiel: Crowley.
>
> Crowley: King!
>
> Castiel: <u>(annoyed) King. If you -- if you would -- if you would be so kind... The three ingredients on this list.</u>
>
> Crowley: "Forbidden fruit." Well, for starters, it's a quince, you dummy, not an apple. No problem. "Golden Calf"... Or what's left of it -- check. "Something Rowena loves"?
>
> Castiel: I would've thought it would've been you, but...
>
> Crowley: Spare me. I've lived it.
>
> Castiel: Well...
>
> Crowley: I'm in.
>
> Crowley disappears. Castiel walks towards his car.

> Death (off-screen): Don't tell me that's queso.
>
> Dean turns around and sees Death standing in the restaurant.
>
> Dean: Yeah -- yes. <u>Queso and, uh, taquitos, tamales. (Dean brings a tray of food over to Death) Homemade by yours truly. All with the bad fat. (Death sniffs the food)</u> Consider it an offering.
>
> Death: For?

> *INT. ABANDONED DISTILLERY - NIGHT*
>
> Rowena is sat at a desk she's chained to, working on deciphering the Book of the Damned. Castiel is pacing behind her.
>
> Rowena: You're delusional, Tweetie Pie. You really expected Crowley to help you.
>
> Castiel: Well, he said he would.
>
> Rowena: Ah. "He said he would," that's practically a blood oath right there. My mistake for assuming otherwise.
>
> Castiel: Why would you wanna assassinate your son in the first place? Under any circumstances.
>
> Rowena: Are you joking?
>
> Castiel: No. That would be uncharacteristic of me. Although I have been told that I'm getting funnier.
>
> Rowena: <u>My son, aside from being a noxious blowhard, suffers from the same malady as you, I'm afraid: Winchester Derangement Syndrome.</u>
>
> Castiel: Oh, is that so? Well, I feel fine.
>
> Rowena: Please. <u>An angel of the Lord, the King of Hell, more power than I could possibly dream of, utterly wasted, shattered at the altar of Winchester. I may be the one in chains, but the two of you are just as much a prisoner as I. It saddens me. No, it totally sickens me, to see so much power go unspent. So much glory unclaimed.</u>
>
> Castiel: Glory? Oh, I've seen glory. And I've seen defeat. But I have seen the glory. I have won epic battles, and I have reaped vast rewards. <u>And none of it has meant as much to me as the relationships that I've formed on Earth. Sam and Dean? They are like a family to me.</u> Claire Novak... When she smiled at me? Nothing, no -- no angelic crusade, or victor's bounty, none of that could ever hold a candle to that sweet (chuckles), crooked smile.
>
> Rowena: <u>You can't honestly think you're happier now. A broken-winged suck-up.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>All I know is that for the first time in a long time... I feel at peace with who I am. Whatever that may be.</u>
>
> Rowena: <u>A bitch.</u>
>
> Castiel: Oh, I can assure you... if there's one thing I am not, it is a female dog.
>
> Rowena looks astounded by Castiel'S obliviousness.

> *INT. BARN - NIGHT*
>
> Castiel walks into the barn with a duffel bag where Crowley is waiting.
>
> Crowley: Looking a little wan there, Cassie. How's that grace of yours holding up?
>
> Castiel: It's fine, Crowley. I'm fine.
>
> Crowley: Sure. The clock's ticking again, isn't it? So heroic. Running errands all over the U.S., burning through that rather finite supply of grace, <u>all in a desperate effort to save your boyfriend.</u>
>
> Castiel: What about you, Crowley? Dropping everything, bringing the First Blade... Surely it cost you something to be here. <u>Maybe he's *your* boyfriend.</u>
>
> Crowley: Hmm. (looking up at Dean) Not my type.
