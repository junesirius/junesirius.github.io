### Idea

**S04E01 Dean lobotomize Cas in Hell during angel rescue**

(inspired by a comment under my tumblr post mentioning Cas 0817 is lobotomized) (heavy angst, canon compliant, canon divergent)

start scene as if normal hospital operation scene, Dean enter in Doctor coat, acting operation on patient, they scream, turn out it's lobotomy, Dean enjoys the process and thinks he's doing the right thing (write in a way as if it's just a Doctor AU, but actually canon-divergent; unnoticeably knowing Azazel&Dean interaction, Dean trusts him, Azazel showing him tricks and Dean outskills him, Azazel=father figure)

turn out this is in Hell, except not even Dean realizes that, he thinks he's doing the right thing, those people need that, so he's doing that to them, he knows it's causing them pain, but he thinks it's a good thing, he feels good about himself (calm tone, not angsty, easy at torturing); when some patient fight back, he constrain them with force, still think it's what's best for them

(the visual of pocket room of Hell, everyone's individual Hell: inspired by *Lucifer*)

then angels come to rescue, Cas is the first/only angel fights off all the demons outside his pocket-Hell and enter the operation room, get force transformed into human vessel form in there, Dean thinks he's just another soul to operate on, Cas try to reason with him, but rule one of save, Dean needs to agree to leave to be saved, but Dean doesn't even realize this is hell so he wouldn't want to leave, and he just thinks Cas is another patient trying to fight/talk his way out; Dean force Cas down (win their fight, cuz Cas hold back, doesn't want to hurt the Righteous Man) to the operation table, lobotomize Cas, Cas forget why he's down here, that he's an angel and he's coming to save Dean, now Cas thinks he's same as Dean so hang around in the room, be his assistant

Cas without memory/knowledge, slow learner, but pick up the tools, operate on others like Dean show him, Dean start to get interested in him (though initially think he's just weird and need punish), fond of him, start trusting him; demons know he's angel, come in (in human form) try to take Cas away, Dean instinctively protect Cas, kill demons

Azazel (in doctor director costume) come in to try to take Cas away/kill him on sight, Dean doesn't let him, Azazel commands Dean kill Cas or he'd be disappointed at him (father figure), Dean hesitates, acts as if intend to kill Cas (Cas frightened) but ends up didn't, instead rebels to Azazel, leaves the operation room and takes Cas with him to outside, see real Hell, shocked, Cas remembers he has wing (reminded by Balthazar?/Dean, Dean believes what he said before lobotomy is true now, tell him back what he initially said), use wing to protect Dean, demons attack, Cas purely muscle memory fight (still vessel shape, still doesn't remember other things before lobotomy), hand on Dean's shoulder (burns Dean, yell) and flies him out ("Dean Winchester is saved")

Cas go back to heaven to regain a copy of memory (backuped before fight/standard version for all angels) from Naomi (hint potential memory messed up again), back in time to meet Dean in barn again, canon compliant
