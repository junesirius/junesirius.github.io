## Draft

### Title

**Stairway to Heaven, Highway to Hell**

Stairway to Heaven: Led Zeppelin song

Highway to Hell: AC/DC song

### Idea

(initial demon!Cas prompt 335+335.5)

maybe because of the S04E01 siege when saving Dean, or other times he has to go to Hell, Cas is affected by something in the Hell, and "all that has been to Hell remains in Hell", he becomes unclean, and his grace fails bit by bit (or quickly), and eventually showing demon signs, demon eyes, demon wings, and ultimately turn into a black-eyed demon.

They panic, notice signs and doesn't know what to do. Or could fast-forward/jump start, directly start the story with Cas being a demon, trace back to figure out why or how, and the transformation process that he undertakes alone. Painful, lonely, more self-loath, self-punishment behavior.

But never evil, he's basically still Cas, kinda like Crowley, good-hearted, actually doesn't have much change all things considered, except for the black eyes. At most a bit more mischievous and very slightly moral ambiguous. (Meg is a decent, good-hearted demon too later. Kinda like later season Meg. could add a little Meg/Crowley teasing Cas? teach him how to be demon, what to watch out, salt/iron/holy water) He even still has wings, or even fixed his broken wings (if it's post-S8 divergent), but he knows the white feathers are black now. He's utterly disgusted by his own wings, his own everything. Might even has some suicidal attempt, but stopped by Dean at last moment, or those attempts fail to kill him, or he does succeed and Dean has to go looking for him and resurrecting him from Empty. He has to continue exist as demon.

(somewhat like Ma'lak Box MoC!Cas → prompt 335.5)

Maybe the "not evil" part is only the beginning, when Cas still can have enough self-control, have consciousness, have good-heart, but it's a losing battle. The change is still happening underway, making his heart more black, hard, cold-blooded, blood-thirsty, brutal, cruel, by each day. They notice it, try hard to keep Cas on human/angel good side, reason with him to see the good choice, be good, be kind. Because if Cas loses it, he'd fully, completely, irreversibly become a demon. Maybe they find some solution, but it's like newly-turned vampire/werewolf reverse spell, it would only work if he doesn't cross some last line. Cas is losing control and painful, and Dean/everyone is trying their best to help him.

And maybe Cas still loses it, or something really bad happened. Maybe he attacks Dean with his demon-controlled darkened mind, remembering the harm and pain Dean does to him. Cas accuses Dean, Dean is too guilty to resist, and Cas (accidentally or forcefully?) kills Dean (≈ "Into the Fire" MoC!Dean, kills Cas when controlled, heavy angst). Cas comes back to himself briefly and pains too much, and turns completely to a demon in his heartbroken moment.

have to figure out a way to turn Cas back and save Dean again, maybe Cas doesn't care anything anymore and goes to Heaven to find Dean, which should burn him alive and kill him (which he doesn't mind and thinks he actually deserves it), which end up purifying him and cure him. And the solution is basically because of the love he has for Dean is too strong, demonization process is stripping out the emotions, but love is not an emotion, not just a thread of feeling, it's everything, it's integrated into him, so strong and focused and pure that it becomes the spark that weave the rest of his consciousness back and gets rid of the demonness. So it's not Heaven that purifies the demon, it's seeing Dean when he's in Heaven and the willingness to self-sacrifice for him that heals/reverse-changes him.

The two of them go back to Earth together again. HE.



the whole "turning to demon" is because of MoC, Cas died when he still has MoC and resurrected by Mark and becomes a demon

somewhere in the process there must be one plot he beats the shit out of Dean and almost kills Dean, just for the S10E22's sake

one solution to help him stay human, similar to demon trial Crowley, human blood can purify demon, so Dean tries to purify demon!Cas with his blood, making Cas very openly addicted to Dean's blood and express love

some talk about putting him to Ma'lak Box, divergent from S15E09 monster ending because Dean doesn't put Cas into Ma'lak Box, they won't end up becoming vampires, MoC!Cas help smite so many monsters, he's more powerful/strong than usual (similar to S05E04 Dean seeing the AU ending if he doesn't say yes to Michael, the world becomes that, but his takeaway is to not distance Sam; so S15E09 Sam's takeaway from the AU ending, is they don't put Cas into Ma'lak Box, they'll help him, they can win this monster ending, at least die trying)

to release the Mark Dean has to do the spell and kill Cas, what if the timing is off, they rely on Mark to resurrect Cas then to remove Mark

potential solution: split and transfer the Mark to all living souls, the whole human race everyone takes a piece to lock God away, maybe be a little darker and living longer (still morally ambiguous? not all human sign up for this, they're playing God to make the decision for whole human race, distain the whole human race basically, and they don't know it would work before they try, too much risk, they might end up killing all humans, but the alternative is all monster killing all human, practically the same risk; need to think if there's a better solution)

### Canon S15E09 Script Reading

#### Monster ending timeline

(the initial S15E09 Monster Ending as Chuck designed, summarized in [super wiki](http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/15.09_The_Trap))

##### 01/16/2020 (present time): lock Chuck up

they open the Rift and shut Chuck with MoC

##### 04/17/2020 11:42:02 PM: vampires kill Claire

Sam, Eileen, Dean, Cas are having a relaxed evening in the Bunker, when Jody rings to tell them Claire was killed when they were hunting vampires and there turned out to be more than expected.

> (That man who disappeared in Florida turns out he was eaten by an alligator.)
>
> A bruised and bloody Jody sits behind the wheel (of her truck) -- her arm's injured, but she's made a crude tourniquet. Right now, she's pale -- quiet. Tamping down her anger and grief.
>
> Jody: "It... it was only three vamps. Me, and Claire, we went in armed to the teeth -- but there were more. So many more."
>
> And Jody starts to break down.
>
> Jody: "She's dead. Claire's dead."
>
> 04/17/2020 11:46 PM

##### 01/06/2021 09:09:18 PM: werewolves kill victims, Cas was already locked

Sam and Dean are in the Impala, having just fought a pack of werewolves and failing to save any of the victims. They mention that Cas is gone and Dean muses that the monsters are winning. The scenery that they drive by shows buildings on fire.

> Sam and Dean drive back from a Hunt. They look battered -- fresh bruises mingle with old scars. Dean white-knuckles the wheel, as Sam stares out the window, lost in thought. The car passes some kind of still burning FIRE... the flames' reflections streak across the car. Sam doesn't even flinch.
>
> Dean: "I know what you're thinking, but -- we did everything we could."
>
> Sam: "We could've gone in sooner."
>
> Dean: "Place was crawling with wolves, we <u>had to</u> wait."
>
> Sam: "And the victims died -- bled out on the floor."
>
> Then-- more regretful, almost wishful--
>
> Sam: "Cas were still here, he could've healed them--"
>
> Dean: "Well he's not."
>
> Dean speaks almost emotionlessly-- it's an already old wound.
>
> Sam and Dean both gone quiet -- we can now hear the RADIO, babbling quietly...
>
> Radio Newscaster: "... Pittsburgh has been declared a no-go zone. We spoke with Comptroller Wilkes -- city government's highest-ranking survivor."
>
> Comptroller Wilkes: (voice breaking) "Our once proud city is gone. To my fellow Pittsburghians-- take shelter where you can. And if you see one of those things-- RUN."
>
> Dean shuts the radio off. Sam and Dean are grim.
>
> Dean: "They're winning, Sammy. The monsters are winning."

##### 11/03/2021 11:42:36 AM: Donna, Claire, Eileen were all already dead

Sam and Dean have returned from a vampire hunt, and Sam is keen to head out again. Dean is feeling hopeless -- there are just too many monsters and they aren't even saving people anymore. They mention that after Cas took on the MoC as part of the plot to cage Chuck, he went crazy and had to be locked in a Ma'lak Box. The monsters are everywhere and all their friends are either dead or they've quit hunting, except for Jody and Bobby. Dean suspects that they all carry a death wish: Jody after Donna, Claire, and the other girls were killed; Bobby always had a death wish; and Sam after Eileen was killed.

> Sam arms up, even more battle-scarred than the last time-- almost dead-eyed.
>
> Dean: "What are you doing? We just got back--"
>
> Sam: "We don't act now -- nest'll move on."
>
> Dean: "No. Sam -- I'm worried about you."
>
> Sam: "What are you saying?"
>
> Dean: "What I've been trying to say for months. It's time. To-- stand down."
>
> Sam: "You want to-- quit? What's happened to you, Dean? Ever since--"
>
> Sam stops himself.
>
> Dean: "Ever since, what? Since we've lost just about everybody we care about? Since the Mark drove Cas crazy? Since I had to <u>bury him</u> in a Ma'lak Box, since... (collecting himself) Monsters are everywhere. What we do now isn't even Hunting, it's whack-a-mole-- we don't even <u>save people</u>. Every friend we ever had is either dead-- or they've gotten wise and packed it in."
>
> Sam: "Jody's still fighting. Apocalypse Bobby is too--"
>
> Dean: "He has a death wish. After what happened with Donna and the girls-- Jody does, too. And after Eileen-- <u>so do you</u>."
>
> A beat on Sam, bristling at the diagnosis. Then--
>
> Sam: "So-- what? We spend the rest of our lives in this tomb-- eating canned food and reading old paperbacks til we die? What happened to Butch and Sundance? Going out swinging?"
>
> Dean: "We can't-- we <u>lost</u>, Sam. I'm done."
>
> He moves out of the room, Sam follows--
>
> Sam: "Dean..."

##### 11/03/2021 12:36:38 PM: Sam/Dean get turned into vampires

Sam tells Dean he is heading out on the hunt and Dean resignedly follows him. Chuck comments that Dean should've followed his gut. This is the day they are both turned into vampires.

> Sam: "Well-- I'm raiding that nest-- with or without you."
>
> On Dean-- giving into Sam's nihilism.
>
> Dean: "Then-- guess I don't have much of a choice."
>
> And Dean starts leading Sam out of the bunker--

##### 12/09/2022 03:11:38 AM: Sam/Dean get killed as vampires by Jody/Bobby

Sam and Dean prepare to take a last stand in a hotel room. Two hunters and Jody and Bobby approach. They storm the room -- to kill Sam and Dean who have been turned into vampires. They kill the hunters and Jody manages to shoot Sam with a dead man's blood bullet. Dean bites and kills Jody, and Bobby beheads Sam. The vision ends with Sam's death, leaving Dean and Bobby's ultimate fates unknown.

> We are in a dirty flophouse-- stained mattress on the floor, bare walls. Dean and Sam throw some crates against a door, barricading themselves. They seem grimier, more battle-scarred than before-- but they're keyed up, in high spirits--
>
> Sam: Only way in.
>
> Dean: We'll be ready for 'em.
>
> Sam: We're outnumbered.
>
> Dean: What else is new?
>
> He gives Sam a big, reassuring smile--
>
> Dean: Those bastards take us down-- at least we go down together.
>
> Sam: Butch and Sundance.
>
> Dean: Go out swinging.
>
> Off their oddly joyful nihilism, we BEGIN AN INTERCUT--
>
> FOUR HUNTERS (in post-apocalyptic Hunterwear) charge up the stairs-- JODY and AU!BOBBY among them. They're making their way to Sam and Dean's refuge. As they get closer--
>
> AU!Bobby: Hold up!
>
> AU!Bobby stops Jody-- Jody signals to the others to wait.
>
> AU!Bobby: Sure you're ready for this? (off her look) It's Sam and Dean, Jody.
>
> Jody: No, Bobby-- those things? They ain't our boys.
>
> BACK IN THE FLOPHOUSE-- Sam and Dean share a look-- and FANG OUT! Holy shit-- they're vampires!
>
> As Sam and Dean prepare to fight for their (vampire) lives--
>
> BACK IN THE STAIRWELL-- Jody levels with AU!Bobby.
>
> Jody: We're doing this <u>for</u> Sam and Dean. <u>This</u> is what they would've wanted.
>
> Off AU!Bobby's nod, and Jody's grim resolve--
>
> BACK IN THE FLOPHOUSE-- as Sam and Dean take position. Ready for the coming onslaught. Finally--
>
> THE DOORS BUST OPEN! It's chaos-- four Hunters against Sam and Dean! As Dean and Sam get their hands full with the two REDSHIRTS... making quick work of them--
>
> Jody does a stealthy ROLL across the floor-- finding Sam's flank. She aims at his side with a PISTOL-- FIRES!
>
> Sam's hit! He lets go of his Redshirt, clutches his side-- Dead Man's Blood coursing through his veins. He's PARALYZED, watching as Jody charges towards him-- Dean leaps at Jody's neck, tears out her jugular.
>
> As Dean snarls, feeding on a DYING JODY-- BACK ON SAM-- fading... AU!Bobby coming up behind him with a machete. As Dean drops Jody's corpse, finally seeing AU!Bobby's approach on Sam--
>
> --too late. AU!Bobby's machete slices towards Sam's neck. As it makes contact--
>
> (back to present)

> Sam: It'll be better. If we win, if we beat you-- I'll <u>make</u> it better--
>
> Chuck: You can't Sam. You, Sam Winchester, have been playing fast and loose with the laws of magic and nature for a long time-- you and your brother. Always breaking the rules. I-- <u>I love that about you,</u> Sam. It's so heroic, so-- Promethean. (then) But there's so much about the fabric of the universe you still don't know-- that you <u>can't</u> know. 'Cause-- you're only humans. (then) But I'm <u>God</u>.
>
> Chuck: You think as long as you don't kill me, everything'll be fine-- all of existence won't collapse. Okay. But trapping me, taking me off the board-- you didn't think there'd be <u>consequences</u>? (then) Think about what I showed you, look past the Mark, look past you and Dean fanging out-- heartbreaking, but <u>not</u> the headline news.
>
> Sam: The monsters.
>
> Chuck: ("now you've got it") <u>The monsters</u>.
>
> Chuck: I know you see me as the bad guy, now. But my role in the universe, it's always been mixed-- more "chaotic neutral." (then) I do good, too.
>
> Sam: Like what?
>
> Chuck: I keep a balance-- a hand on the scales. I make sure you and your brother win more often than you lose. (then) Haven't you ever wondered why there aren't more monsters? Why vamps aren't out there breeding like bunnies? Me. That's me. Right here. (then) And without me-- it's a law of nature. Dark forces prevail, monsters rule. And you, your brother, and everyone you love will die.
>
> On Sam, crestfallen.
>
> Chuck: Can you really live with that?
>
> Off Sam, devastated, his faith in his plan shattering--

#### Side notes about destiel in Purgatory

> Dean: We should split up.
>
> Cas: What?
>
> Dean: You go that way -- I'll try this way. Meet back at the Rift. (off his look) We'll cover twice the ground -- improve our odds.
>
> Cas: Yes. It will also improve our odds of getting lost. Or killed.
>
> Cas is firm. On Dean -- seeing Cas's point.
>
> **Cas: I know you're worried about Sam. But -- however much we'd both like a break from each other right now -- splitting up's too risky.**
>
> Dean knows Cas is right -- but he's worked up, frustrated.
>
> Cas: Come on.

> Dean: Cas. Can you hear me?
>
> Dean: I hope it's not too late, that wherever you are-- you can hear this. (then) I should've stopped you.
>
> Dean: **When Mom died-- I blamed myself. Plenty. But even then-- I had plenty left to go around. So I put what I couldn't take on you. (then) I wanted you to stay-- of course I wanted you to stay.** You're my best friend. (then) But-- I let you go, 'cause it was easier than admitting I was wrong, and...
>
> Dean: <u>I'm sorry</u>.
>
> He's lost Cas in Purgatory, he doesn't have the Blossom, and he's running out of time. Off Dean, shattered, DEFEATED--

> Cas: We were en route. I waited-- until I saw this.
>
> And Cas holds out a Leviathan Blossom. On Dean-- holy shit.
>
> Cas: It got a bit-- smushed. (then) Once I had the Blossom, I fought-- caught them off guard. They fought back... I managed to get away...
>
> Dean: **It's-- amazing. You did-- amazing.**
>
> Cas: They're still looking for me. We should hurry--
>
> Cas trudges to the Rift. On Dean.
>
> Dean: Cas. I--
>
> Cas: Dean-- you don't have to. (then) I heard your prayer.
>
> As Dean and Cas, victorious and reconciled, enter the Rift--

> Dean and Cas hurriedly perform a spell-- Michael's spell. The BLOSSOM rests in a bowl-- as Cas chants above it.
>
> Dean watches, nervous-- as Cas pulls out a knife.
>
> Dean: Cas, you sure?
>
> Cas solemnly nods-- cuts himself, BLEEDS into the bowl.
>
> Cas: You've already taken the Mark. You can't take it again. <u>I</u> can. (then) It's the only way.
>
> Oh shit! Cas is taking the Mark! (And thanks to Chuck's flash forwards, we know how badly that ends.) As Cas resumes chanting... and the Blossom sputters with MAGICAL SMOKE--
>
> --Dean holds out an ORB (the orb we saw in Chuck's flash forward), catching the smoke as it rises... completing Michael's spell--
