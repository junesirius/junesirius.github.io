>  EK: There is never any plan for Dean to jump into Hell with Sam. The ending that I had in mind was way more with a horror movie DNA, which I think would be really unsatisfying.
>
> The way the ending was supposed to go is, Sam goes into Hell, Dean works his ass off trying to get him out in Montage, kinda similar to what's there, but ultimately can't, because Dean's big emotional movement was he had to learn to let go of his brother.
>
> So now the fact that his brother is being tortured in Hell -- I mean, my guess was when we originally came up with it, we won't quite so specific. We didn't have like -- remember when we have Dean in that Hell raiser chain world, so I think it was probably more like "Oh, where did he go? But I'm gonna let him go." is what I remember.
>
> And so Dean goes back to Lisa, and then they have a baby. And it's a girl, he names the baby Samantha. And then the final image will be like, he's got Samantha, and he kisses Samantha, and he kisses Lisa, and he puts the baby in the crib. And they leave and they turn off the light. And then a dark figure comes over the crib, and it goes back to the teaser of Supernatural. And so there is a dark figure, and then a hard black out.
>
> So the strong implication is it's all gonna start all over again. So Dean is gonna become John, Samantha is going to be the new demon hunter, and his wife is going to be on the ceiling, and Sam is obviously gonna get back into... It's meant to end with a really big question mark, of like this story is going to continue.
>
> So that was the ending. There was a lot of question marks, and not a happy ending. It was gonna be that horror movie, you know, Jason pops out of the water at the end kind...

(Eric Kripke mentioned his version of the original five-season ending after Swan Song in his interview with Rich/Rob in the podcast Supernatural Then and Now. Aired Aug. 1, 2025.)

<br>

So, tl'dr: After Sam goes into Hell, Dean works his ass off trying to get him out of Hell, but can't. Dean eventually learns to let his brother go and marries Lisa. They have a baby girl, and Dean names her Samantha. And then a dark figure goes to Samantha's crib, Lisa burns on the ceiling like Mary, and the whole story starts all over again: Dean becomes John, Samantha becomes the new demon hunter, and Sam is going to get back from Hell at some point.

The very first and foremost thought of learning Kripke's ending: EK really is the ultimate evil dark god of their universe. If it's all up to EK and the ending turns out like that, we'll be devastated so much worse. With everything they've struggled with in those first five years, it's like nothing has changed; everything goes back to the beginning.

Dean had tried so hard to not become John, and with this ending, he's pushed into the exact same fate as John. His baby girl is going to have the same as him, growing up to be the new generation of demon hunter, just like him.

I would guess, without the kindness of the "God", Cas would end up being killed by Lucifer without being brought back again. So when everything starts all over again, they don't have an angel on their side, just like the beginning of the story in the first three seasons.

EK's preference and strong taste for the dark horror story really extended from the first draft of the pilot (see here) until the end of his era.

<br>

However, there are also some more interesting things to pick from his vision. Like, we know in Season 15, Sam's son is named Dean. And here, Dean's daughter is named Samantha.

And I wonder, why does it feel so natural and destined that Dean's baby would have to be a baby girl? In the episode with the Amazons, Dean gets a daughter, Emma. Claire is practically like Dean's daughter, too, in the later seasons.

Raising a girl, or even just being comfortable to be around with a young girl, must have something fundamentally different from raising a boy. Like making a man gentler, softer, less angry, more loving. And hopefully, not going down the route of raising her like a soldier. Which is probably, hopefully, the main difference that can make Dean different from John, even if he has to witness his wife burning on the ceiling just like his father did.

<br>

Thinking about writing a story just directly inherited from EK's version of Swan Song's ending. It might be a fun dark canon divergent. (I can already foresee it growing into a full season rewrite...)

(And if I do, I know the first thing I'll do is bring Cas back.)

Actually you know what, now I really like how season 6 looks like.
