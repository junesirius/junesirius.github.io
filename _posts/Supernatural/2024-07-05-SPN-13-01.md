> Sam: Hold on a second. Can we just talk about what happened back there?
>
> Dean: Sure. Which part? Let's see. Crowley's dead, Kelly's dead, <u>Cass is -- (he pauses)</u> Mom's gone, and apparently, the Devil's kid hit puberty in thirty seconds flat. Oh, and almost killed us.

> Sam: What about Cass? Is he - is he really dead?
>
> Dean: <u>You know he is.</u>

> Clark: Dude, how high are you?
>
> Jack: I... don't know what that means.
>
> Clark: It means, um, wasted? Lit? Chonged, blitzed, blasted, blazed, baked? Nothing? No? Look, I'm not judging you. I'm jealous! What are you on?

> Jack: <u>I'm on a chair, on the floor, on the planet earth.</u>

> Jack: I'm sorry.
>
> Sam: (confused) What?
>
> Jack: Will you tell them that I'm sorry?
>
> Sam: Yeah. Sure. Of course. (long pause) Jack... how are you, um... How are we... talking right now? I mean, you're -- you're not even a day old. How do you speak English?
>
> Jack: My mother taught me.
>
> Sam: So you talked to her.
>
> Jack: I was her.
>
> Sam: Okay. And, um... your powers. Did she teach you those, too, or...
>
> Jack stands up and walks to the nearest wall, feeling the concrete blocks with his hands, tracing the seams between them as he talks.
>
> Jack: No, I... I don't know why these things happen. It's like I'm me, but... not me.
>
> Sam: Jack, look, um... before you were born, you -- you opened up a door to another world. Do you remember that?
>
> Jack: (inhales deeply, still studying the wall) Yes.
>
> Sam: Okay, um, could you do that again?
>
> Jack: <u>I don't... I... I have to find my father. He'll protect me.</u>
>
> Sam: Jack, you gotta listen to me. That's not really what Lucifer does.
>
> Jack: (still fondling the wall) <u>Lucifer? No, that's not his name. My father is Castiel.</u>
>
> Sam: (shocked) What?
>
> Jack: <u>My mother, she said Castiel, he would keep me safe.</u> She said the world was a dangerous place. That's -- that's why I couldn't be a baby or a child. I... That's why I had to grow up fast. <u>That's why I chose him to be my father. Where is he?</u>
>
> <u>Sam's heart breaks just a lil bit.</u>
>
> Sam: He's dead.
>
> <u>Jack appears saddened and distressed at this news.</u>

> Dean: Why are you here?
>
> Miriam: We want the Golden Ticket. Lucifer 2: Electric Boogaloo.
>
> Dean: Why?
>
> Miriam: Because Bieber in there? He can do almost anything.
>
> Dean: <u>(hopeful) Anything?</u>
>
> Miriam: <u>(chuckles) Oh, sweet. Almost anything. Castiel, he's dead. All the way dead, because of you.</u>
>
> After <u>crushing Dean's hopes enough to distract him</u>, Miriam head butts Dean, giving him a bloody lip, and breaks free, wrestling back her blade and rushing off toward the holding cells.

> The Impala pulls up to the cabin. Sam and Dean get out and go to the trunk to get what they need to build a pyre, while Jack gets out.
>
> Sam: Hey... Hey, you, uh, you sure about this, Dean? <u>I mean, it's -- it's Cass, you know? Maybe we can bring him back, like you said.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>No, we can't.</u>
>
> Sam: Chuck did -- Uh, God did. Remember that? So maybe, um, I don't know, maybe if we prayed to him or -- or...
>
> Dean: <u>You don't think I've tried that?</u>

> Dean: Okay, Chuck... or god, or whatever. I need your help. See, you -- you left us. You left us. You went off. You said... You said the earth would be fine because it had me... and it had Sam, but it's not, and we're not.
>
> Dean: <u>We've lost everything (voice breaks). And now you're gonna bring him back. Okay? You're gonna bring back Cass, you're gonna bring back Mom, you're gonna bring 'em all back. All of 'em. Even Crowley.</u>
>
> Dean: 'Cause after everything that you've done, you owe us, you son of a bitch. So you get your ass down here and you make this right, right here and right now.
>
> <u>Dean waits for an answer, and when he doesn't get one, he hangs his head, and then proceeds to destroy an innocent sign, bloodying his knuckles.</u>
>
> Dean: Please. Please help us.
>
> he waits, and nothing else happens. Dean <u>exhales shakily</u> and returns to the car.

> <u>Downstairs, Dean walks into the room where Cass's body is laid out on a table beneath a sheet. He pauses, taking in the sight, and his shoulder slump. He can barely look at the sheet. He walks around the table, resigned, and lifts the sheet to see Cass's face. He looks away, and covers Cass again before pulling down and tearing up the yellow curtains to bind Cass's body in the sheet. He starts at Cass's feet, tying them together before stopping, taking a deep breath, and looking up at Cass's body in resignation.</u>
>
> Later that night, out at the funeral pyre in the back yard, Dean sloshes gasoline over the pyre where Kelly and Cass have been placed.
>
> Sam: (to Jack) You wanna say anything?
>
> Jack: I... What do you say?
>
> Sam: Right. <u>Thank you. You say thank you. And you say you're sorry. You hope they're somewhere without, uh, sadness or pain. You hope they're somewhere better. You say goodbye.</u>
>
> Dean finishes pouring the gasoline and joins Sam and Jack, pulling out a lighter from his pocket.
>
> Dean: Well, <u>goodbye, Cass. Goodbye, Kelly. Goodbye, Crowley. Goodbye, Mom.</u>
>
> Sam: Dean, we don't know if Mom --
>
> Dean: Yeah, we do. We do, Sam. Lucifer killed her the moment he realized we trapped his ass. He killed her. You know he did. She's gone. <u>They're all gone.</u>
>
> <u>Dean flicks his lighter open and lights it, throwing it at the pyre and watching it burn.</u>
