> Sam: "When we broke this thing open last night, every maternity ward within a hundred-mile radius got slammed. Looks like any woman in the last month of her pregnancy went into labor."

Call me a nerd, but I'm getting curious about exactly how many women that is, and how many babies share the same date of birth on May 4th, 2012. So I tried to do a little bit of Fermi Estimation.

<br>

First of all, what's the population that's affected within that range?

To answer that, we'll first need to have an estimation of their rough location.

The location of that abandoned building where Sam and Dean cracked open the tablet is unclear, but what we do know is the location before and after that. They stole the tablet from Richard Roman Empire in Chicago, Illinois, the night before at 11:15pm, and drove for quite some distance away immediately after (Dean has a line "Why don't we answer that a few thousand miles away from here" in S07E20) until they sent Charlie off at a bus station in the morning, so the location is probably about a night's drive from Chicago.

They received Meg's call in the morning on the next day, shortly after 10:22am (in Eastern timezone, according to Kevin's timeline, when he was in Michigan), and arrived at the hospital where Cas was in, in Indiana (which is also Eastern timezone) after nightfall. The sunset time in Indiana on May 5, 2012, is 8:45pm. So it's about a 10-hour drive from Indiana.

And also, Kevin was driving from Michigan to the tablet's location (Dean's location), but when they headed out to Cas's hospital, Kevin had to take a 180-degree turn to catch up. Which means they were heading the opposite direction from Michigan to Indiana.

So, that puts the abandoned building in the south of the Michigan-Indiana line-up at a 10-hour distance, which makes it somewhere south of Alabama near the Gulf.

The population density in Alabama in 2012 was about 93.8 people per square mile. For ease of calculation, we'll just use this average without differentiating the difference in rural vs city areas.

A hundred-mile radius is equal to 31416 square miles, making the total population in the affected area about 3,000,000 people.

<br>

Second, we estimate the birth rate and the number of pregnancies in the last month.

The total number of registered births in the US in 2012 was about 4,000,000; the total population of the time was about 314 million, making it about 12.7 births per 1000 people.

So with the estimated 3 million people in the affected area, that was about 37,500 births for the entire year.

Assuming all the months are equivalent over the year, then all the women in the last month of their pregnancies are equivalent to all the babies that would have had their birthday within the month to be on the same day, which is 1/12 of the births of the year.

So 1/12 of the total annual births of the year makes it about 3000 babies at the time.

<br>

So now we have the answer, because Sam and Dean knocked on the tablet that night without knowing what it would do, there were 3000 people in southern Alabama who had the exact same date of birth on May 4th.

I imagine all those people would notice this fact as they grow up. And so maybe even host an annual event every year to celebrate their common birthday. Say, like this year, May 4th, 2025, it would be a party of 3000 families celebrating all their kids' 13-year-old birthdays (and might as well celebrate Star Wars day too).

That feels like a way bigger impact on a lot of people and a lot of families than just a passing line that no one seemed to care about ever since.
