The town in California is also a fool's errand. The mine that was said to be robbed, they never had any gold to begin with. Upon Cas's very persuasive inquiry, the mine owner admits it was just a way to keep the miners' minds at peace.

"Clint Eastwood is just a convenient name to put," the man murmurs.

"And why is that?"

"Oh, because he's gonna die soon, we can just say the gold is gone with him." The mine owner shrugs. "The railway companies have been recruiting the best men to join a posse to go after him and his gang. They have the best trackers who can find any man in the whole world like a rabbit in a hole. Think the railway can't take any more robbery losses now."

Cas scowls at the news and lets the man go. "Where can I find this posse?"

"Try Thunderhill, Colorado. Heard the sheriff there volunteered. Probably a personal grudge."

The town name rings a bell. Didn't that skinny bartender and saloon owner say he's from the same place?

Cas urges the horse onward as he rides across the land toward Colorado, wondering just how much trouble Dean has gotten himself into back in Colorado.

<br>

Cas finds the posse the night before they head out. The town sheriff, Little Bill, is counting heads. They are one person short of a dozen, so Cas makes it to the last spot.

Little Bill tells them a story at the saloon many months ago, and how ruthless Clint Eastwood was when he murdered men and humiliated women. The story sounds nothing like Dean, but everyone in the posse gets so motivated that they all shout damnation to this Clint Eastwood they've never met and eager to head out hunting the man down.

Cas wants nothing more than to yell at these credulous men, telling them how wrong they are and how misleading those stories are. But if he did, then he would for sure get kicked out of the posse with no way to find Dean again, all while a group of cowboys hunts him down like hounds chasing hares.

He bites his lips to keep from showing any sign of disapproval on his face.

"You with us, Novak? Hunt the man down and kill him by all means?" Little Bill stares at him when he doesn't jump up and down like the others.

Cas forces a quick smile and nods. "Yes, by all means."

<br>

The Indian trackers are indeed exceptional at keeping up with the trail.

Sometimes when there are absolutely no tracks to his eyes, both his human eyes and true eyes, the Indians can still give them clear directions to go.

They pick up the day-old trace from Nevada, moving southeast, then follow all the way to New Mexico.

Cas thinks he catches a glimpse of three horses on top of a mountain, hundreds of miles away. One of the figures is so familiar that his heart skips a beat. But when they reach that spot, the men are another hundred miles away again, like a fleeting mirage.

Cas wonders if he's hallucinating their figures.

They keep moving. So do they.

When they are back to Colorado, the Indians tell Little Bill the traces split into two paths.

The sheriff curses. "They must've separated."

Cas asks, "Which way has fewer people?"

The Indians point the way to north.

Cas urges his horse in that pointed direction. "I'm going that way." He states, quietly hoping the group will also split, and that fewer will choose to follow Dean.

Which, of course, turns out one's wish is never granted, as their luck always goes.

<br>

As the hint of winter closes in, they follow the trail to a town in Wyoming.

Cas recognizes the town the moment they roll in -- Sunrise, Wyoming, where all the messy trouble starts. He never thought he'd be back here again. The saloon building has been rebuilt in the past months. No sign to show the old one has been burnt down in a fire.

Dean is cornered in the sheriff's office. Flickering lights show his silhouette on and off, switching between windows. Cas watches him, thinking this is the closest they've ever been since the last time they were both in this town.

Dean's prayer reaches him, pained and desperate, asking for him. With the distance so close, they can probably hear each other if they just speak loudly enough.

Cas gets off his horse, and tells the sheriff he'll go in there first. Alone.

Little Bill eyes him. "He'll shoot you like a walking sieve."

Cas answers plainly, "Maybe he will, maybe he won't."

Little Bill regards him closely, up and down, as if taking his shabby clothing and his beard in for the first time. "You know him, don't you? That's why you want to join. Probably never even thought about killing him for once. Who are you to him, a lover?"

Cas keeps his face stoic, standing still. Keeping his eyes on the sheriff's office. Dean's prayer continues, so more than half his attention is taken away from the conversation before him.

The man smirks, reaching for his gun, swinging it casually at him. "Maybe you're just making all our lives easier, we can lure him out without a fight."

The rest of the posse starts moving toward him. The men and the horses circle around him.

"Don't," Cas warns them, jaw tight, eyes flicking between them and where Dean is.

They laugh, tightening the circle, their backs to the sheriff's office.

There is a sudden burst of glaring light from inside the sheriff's office, the air vibrates with electricity. At the very same moment, guns go off, and Dean's prayer hitches.

Cas turns around sharply, drawing his gun at the posse. They draw theirs, firing at the same time.

Bullets hit him, back and leg and arm, warm blood streaming down, but Cas keeps standing, continuing to fire. The other men are surprised, soon terrified. Some of them see the wounds that would surely kill a man but not even slow him down, they rise to their horses, wanting to flee. Cas shoots their legs and they fall to the ground in loud moaning, until no men are left standing.

Little Bill falls from his horse too, crawling desperately with a wounded leg, as Cas walks toward him, pointing a gun at his face. The man widens his eyes in horror. Cas pulls the trigger, the man flinches violently. But the gun is empty. Cas pulls it again, and Little Bill flinches again, more shakenly. For three pulls, Cas watches the horror growing in the man's eyes, shaking like a leaf in the winter gust. Cas throws the empty gun at him, then hurries toward the sheriff's office.

The barricaded door is easy to break through, the light inside the room is blinding to any human. But to Cas, the shapes are familiar. One belongs to Dean, the other to his old self.

Dean is on the ground, backing up, holding himself, both of the guns in his hand are out of bullets. His old self is preparing for a deadly strike.

Cas tears him away from Dean, unfolding his own true form. The wings are barely healed, the new bullet wounds slow his vessel down, but Dean is here. If he loses, it would mean his old self -- if he keeps following the orders as he knows he would -- is going to kill Dean. *He*, would be the one who causes Dean's death. And Cas can't allow that to happen.

He fights like there is no future, and his old self is no match. Drinking in his own grace, he knows his past self would be wounded for decades, maybe centuries, but he's here now, with no memory of this encounter, which means there is no consequence too severe to bear. He drains his past self and wipes the memory, sending him back to Heaven.

Like he told Dean, his past self has the luxury of healing slowly, he doesn't.

The new grace he just absorbed heals him well completely, both his body and true form growing strong and complete.

Cas turns to Dean, finally. Finally.

*It's been a long time.* He thinks, breathing out long in relief. *You have no idea how long it has been. And I finally found you.*

He says none of that, only to hold the man tight, with all his strength but careful enough not to break him.

Dean's breath is uneven over his shoulder. They hold each other like that, just breathing together, in the same space, in the same time, one hundred and fifty years too early, hundreds of thousands of miles too far. And yet, they are at ease.

Breathing in, breathing out. The warm and solid touch under his hands. The bone, the muscle, the skin; the hair, the stubble, the freckles.

Cas scrutinizes him once they pull apart. The face and look that are all so familiar, but the long beard and new wrinkles creased by the western sand and wind make the face new and mature. The eyes trained on his, sparkling with glitter.

Eventually, Cas decides, that all he can say is just, "Hello, Dean."
