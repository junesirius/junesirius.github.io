The town in California is also a fool's errand. The mine that is said to be robbed, they never has any gold to begin with. Upon Cas's very persuasive query, the mine owner admits it's just a way to keep the miners' mind in peace.

"Clint Eastwood is just a convenient name to put." The man murmurs.

"And why is that?"

"Oh because he's gonna die soon, we can just say the gold is gone with him." The mine owner shrugs. "The railway companies have been recruiting the best men to join a posse to go after him and his gang. They have the best trackers that can find any man in the whole world like a rabbit in a hole. Think the railway can't take any more robbery loss now."

Cas scowls at the news and lets the man go. "Where can I find this posse?"

"Try Thunderhill, Colorado. Heard the sheriff there volunteered. Probably a personal grudge."

The town name rings a bell. Didn't that skinny bartender and saloon owner say he's from the same place?

Cas rushes the horse as he rides across the land toward Colorado, wondering just how much trouble Dean has got himself into back in Colorado.

<br>

Cas finds the posse the night before they head out. The town sheriff Little Bill is counting the head. They are one person short of a dozen, so Cas makes to the last spot.

Little Bill tells them a story at the saloon many months ago, and how ruthless Clint Eastwood was when he murders men and humiliates women. The story sounds nothing like Dean, but everyone in the posse gets so inspired they all shouts damnation to this Clint Eastwood they've never met and eager to head out hunting the man down.

Cas wants nothing but yell at these men, telling them how wrong they are and how misleading those stories are. But then he would for sure get kicked out of the posse with no way of finding Dean again, all while a group of cowboys hunting him down like hounds chasing hares.

He bites on his own lips to not show any sign of disapproval.

"You with us, Novak? Hunt the man down and kill him by all means?" Little Bill stares at him when he doesn't jump up and down like the others.

Cas forces a quick smile and nods. "Yes, by all means."

The Indian trackers are indeed exceptional in keeping up with the tracks.

Sometimes when there are absolutely no track to his eyes, both his human eyes and true eyes, the Indians can still give them clear directions to go.

They pick up the days old trace from Nevada, moving to south east, then following all the way to New Mexico.

Cas thinks he catches a glimpse at three horses on top of the mountain, hundreds of miles away. One of the figures is so familiar that his heart skips a beat. But when they reach that spot, the men are another hundreds of miles away again, like a flyaway mirage.

Cas wonders if he's hallucinating their figures.

They keep moving. So are them.

When they are back to Colorado, the Indians tell Little Bill the traces are split into two ways.

The sheriff curses. "They must separated."

Cas asks, "Which way has less people?"

The Indians point the way to the north.

Cas urges his horse toward the pointed direction. "I'm going that way." He states, quietly hoping the group could also split, and that less would choose to follow Dean.

Which, of course, turns out one's wish is never granted, as their luck always go.

<br>

As the hint of winter closing in, they follow the trace to the town in Wyoming.

Cas recognizes the town the moment they roll in. Sunrise, Wyoming, where all the messes start. He never thought he'd be back here again. The saloon house has been rebuilt in the past months. No sign to show the old one has been burnt down in a fire.

Dean gets cornered in the sheriff's office. Flickering lights show his silhouette on and off, switching between windows. Cas watches him, thinking this is the closest they've ever been since last time they were both in this town.

Dean's prayer reaches him, pained and desperate, asking for him. With the distance so close, they can probably hear each other if they just speak loud enough.

Cas gets off the horse, and tells the sheriff he'll go in there first. Alone.

Little Bill eyes him. "He'll shoot you like a walking sieve."

Cas answers plainly. "Maybe he will, maybe he won't."

Little Bill regards him closely, up and down, as if taking his shabby clothing and his look in for the first time. "You know him, don't you? That's why you want to join, probably never even thought about killing him for once. A lover?"

Cas keeps his face stoic, standing still. Keeping his eyes on the sheriff's office. Dean's prayer continues, so half his attention is taken away from the conversation before him.

The man smirks, reaching for his gun, swinging casually at him. "Maybe you're just making all our lives easier, we can lure him out without a fight."

The rest of the posse starts moving toward him. The men and the horses circle around him.

"Don't." Cas warns them, jaws tights, eyes flashing between them and where Dean is.

They laugh, shrinking the circle, facing away from the sheriff's office.

There is a sudden burst of glaring light from inside the sheriff's office, the air vibrates with electricity. At the very same moment, guns go off, and Dean's prayer hitches.

Cas turns around sharp, drawing his gun at the posse. They draw theirs, firing at the same time.

Bullets hit him, back and leg and arm, warm blood streaming down, but Cas keeps standing, continues the shooting. The other men are surprised, soon terrified. Some of them see the wounds that would for sure kill a man but not even slow him down, they rise to the horses and want to run. Cas shoots their legs and they fall to the ground in loud moaning, until no men leaves standing.

Little Bill falls from his horse too, crawling desperately with a wounded leg, as Cas walks toward him, pointing a gun to his face. The man widens his eyes in horror. Cas pulls the trigger, he flinches violently. But the gun is blank. Cas pulls it again, he flinches again. For three times, Cas watches the horror growing in the man, he throws the empty gun at him, then hurries toward the sheriff's office.

The barricaded door is easy to break, the light inside the room is blinding to any human. But for Cas, the shapes are familiar. One belongs to Dean, the other his old self.

Dean is on the ground, backing up, holding himself, both of the guns in his hand are out of bullets. His old self is preparing for a deadly strike.

Cas tears him away from Dean, unfolding his own true forms. The wings are barely healed, the new bullet wounds slow his vessel down, but Dean is here. If he loses, it would mean his old self, if keep following the order as he knew he would, is going to kill Dean. *He*, would be the one who causes Dean's death. And Cas can't allow that happen.

He fights like there is no future, and his old self is no match. Drinking in his own grace, he knows his past self would be wounded for decades maybe centuries, but he's here, now, no memory of this encounter, which means there is no consequence that is too severe to bear. He drains his past self and wipes the memory, sending him back to Heaven.

Like he tells Dean, his past self has the luxury of healing slowly, he doesn't.

The new grace he absorbed heal himself well, both the body and the true form grow strong and complete.

Cas turns to Dean, finally. Finally.

*It's been a long time.* He thinks, breathing out long and relieved. *You have no idea how long it has been. And I finally find you.*

He says none of that, only to hold the man tight, with all his forces but careful enough not to break him.

Dean's breath is uneven over his shoulder. They hold each other like that, just to breathe together, in the same space, in the same time, one hundred and fifty years too early, hundreds of thousand of miles too far. And yet, they are at ease.

Breathing in, breathing out. The warm and solid touch under the hands. The bone, the muscle, the skin; the hair, the stubble, the freckles.

Cas scrutinizes him once they pull apart. The face and look that is all so familiar, but the long beard and the new wrinkles crimpled by the western sand and wind make the face new and mature. The eyes trained on his, sparkling with glitters.

Eventually, Cas decides, all he can say is just, "Hello, Dean."
