The life on road on horseback and the life on road in car has more similarity than Dean has ever realized. Like the quietness in the night, the road and space all dark, when it seems the whole world dissolves, leaving only him and the Baby floating in the space.

Except, with the black horse, with its rising and falling rhythm of muscle, the feeling of being accompanied by some living, breathing thing is somehow so very soothing. Almost as if he's accompanied by someone he knows.

Dean presses his palms on the horse's back, just to feel its heartbeat. Then slowly feeling his own heartbeat calming down.

He looks up at the starry sky, closing his eyes, exhaling deep, smelling the sand and bushes. *Where are you, man?* He can't help thinking, not even sure if that's a prayer or just a haunting thought keep replaying itself in his mind.

He lets the horse decide the road for him, leaving his own mind wandering -- that's another similar yet different experience as driving, one he can actually taking eyes off the road long enough and need not to worry about crushing into another incoming vehicle.

When the night is deep into the dark and cold hour, he lets the horse rest. Finding a relatively soft spot on the sandy lands, wrapping himself in the blanket, he rests his own eyes for a handful of hours. Then moves on again before the sun fully rises.

Dean thinks about that illustration image of the time flux all the time. The shape of a river, and a floating leave flowing down the stream. He feels exactly like that floating leave now.

<br>

There are towns scattered here and there on the western lands like stars in the night sky. Without a map, Dean doesn't know how exactly he can find one, but the horse knows the ways better than he does. Sometimes he wonders how many places she has already been to.

She leads them into a small town, its name reads Thunderhill, Colorado, according to the wooden plaque swinging outside of the town.

The place looks like a replica of Sunrise, Wyoming, except the main road through the town is wider. Men in fine and well suits come and go on horsebacks, ladies in delicate, laborious dresses. The view is actually somewhat pleasant to enjoy, but Dean is not here for sightseeing.

He goes into the saloon -- at least this has to be universal in all times and all places, there must always be a saloon in each western town, for his comfort.

The girls are more enthusiastic and younger here than Elkins' place. Dean meets their eyes -- they are old-time good-looking, mostly. They grin at him in professional smiles, Dean walks toward the owner of the place and asks for a room.

"You want to pick one you like?" The skinny man behind the counter asks meaningfully, nodding at the girls.

Dean glances back, finding their eyes intensely on his back. He gives a short chuckle, "Nah, just for sleeping."

"Your loss." The man makes a face, pointing him the stairway.

He should probably start planning his grand criminal plan some time soon. Dean thinks as he drags his steps up the stairs, feeling his bones and muscles complaining about sleeping on the wild ground for too many nights in a row, it's making his joints and neck stiff and wrecking like a beat-up car. He has to have at least one decent night before thinking about some big history-breaking-level moves.

Dean throws himself onto the bed that smells something suspicious, but probably wouldn't be too different from those cheap motels he has been used to for his whole life. Dean falls asleep like that without bothering taking his clothes off.

He is waken up several hours later by some loud crying and yelling by the next door. A man is angrily shouting "Whore!" and cursing, and a girl is screaming helplessly. Something is thrown to the floor, crashing to pieces.

Dean jumps to his feet, dashing out to the next room without thinking.

A man twice bigger than him is standing on the lone bed in the center of the room, all naked and hairy, holding a knife in his hand high above head, almost touching the ceiling.

The crying girl curls at the corner of the bed like a startled little creature, wrapping herself up in arms, covering the face with fingers. Unclothed and crying loudly, screaming for her life. Blood streaming from between her fingers.

Dean recognizes her from the group of saloon ladies that greeted him when he arrived.

He approaches the man carefully, eyeing the knife, shortening their distances, tone demanding, "Why don't you put the knife down and let's talk?"

The man glances back at him for a split second, grumbles, "Go away. None of your business."

"It's my business because I was waken up." Dean takes another step ahead, barely a dive's distance away from him now. He tries to hint the girl to get away while the man's distracted, but the girl is just busy crying. He can't tell where that blood comes from and it worries him.

"Very well." The man gnarls. "I'll deal with you once I kill the bitch."

"Can't let you do that." Dean marches the remaining two steps in a heartbeat, arms dragged around the man's waist, pulling him off balance and falling off the bed. The knife is still in his hand.

The man struggles violently and gets loose from Dean's hold, fumbling on to his feet, throwing himself at him.

Dean gets pinned to the ground by the weight, wrestling with all the fighting skills he has picked up over the years, but the battle techniques for creatures are not as useful on a pissed off cowboy.

The man fights like a gorilla, ending up straddling him with one hand pressing on Dean's chest, stopping him from attempts of getting away, the other hand pressing the tip of the knife on his cheek. "You should keep your nose clean." He grits the yellow teeth.

The knife feels cold against his skin. Dean wonders how much he can move his head before it stabs through his skull.

"Cleaner than yours." Dean barks back, staring the man in the eyes deadly focused as if they're in a gun duel. He moves suddenly, so quick that the other doesn't have time to react, and Dean already breaks his hands free from grasp. He twists his wrist in a way that the man has to loose the hold of the knife, and next second, the knife lands in Dean's hand.

Just in a blink's time, their positions shift. Dean holds the knife an inch away from the man's neck, but already close enough to make his point clear. The man stills.

Dean demands, "Now you want to explain what's the matter with the lady?"

Right this second, three men dash into the room, all in uniforms, with a sheriff's pin on the chest of the leading aged man.

"Put down your knife, for Christ's sake!" Three shotguns point at him. The Sheriff steps closer, solemnly, eyes moving between both him and the man in his compliance.

Dean knows better than carrying a knife to a gun fight with three cowboy lawmen.

He lets his hand fall and tied behind his back by a rough rope. The other guy tied to the same wooden stake on the ground.

The Sheriff glares between them. "Now, talk!"

Dean purses his mouth, glancing at the girl in dismay at his rescue.

An elder lady is attending to her wounds. She removes the hand very slowly and reluctantly from her face. Tears are still falling down unstoppingly. A long, bloody cut diagonalizes on her young, pretty face, narrowly missed her eyes, but cutting all the way from forehead across the cheek, reaching the edge of the jaw. One that would undoubtfully leave a permanent scar on that face.

The man tied behind him grumbles, "He came out of nowhere and wanted to kill me, you saw how he moved with a knife. I have to self defend."

Dean rolls his eyes. Should have known, son of bitches around here always mouthful of lies. "Only because he's two seconds away from killing that lady."

"Bitch had it coming." He growls. Dean can feel his shrug against their tied-together back.

"What did she do?" The Sheriff asks.

The naked cowboy doesn't answer.

"Mike, what did she do?"

"She chuckled when she saw his tiny junk, that's what." The elder lady turns from cleaning the wounds on the girl's face, talking on her behalf, snapping harshly. "Now look what he did! She's ruined!"

She's not wrong, his junk dangles pitifully as he moves around earlier. Dean has to strangle a chuckle of his own, but the crowd around them isn't as generous. The cowboy Mike growls something in his breath, the sound throttled in his throat like a caged tiger huffing.

The skinny man behind the counter chimes in. "There has to be justice, Little Bill. Who would want a whore with scarred face? I bought her last spring, and it's a damaged good now. She could have served for another five ten years."

*Wow.* Dean thinks. *Talking about authenticity. The rural, cruel world for the ladies is just part of this era. Those classic movies aren't kidding.*

The Sheriff Little Bill glances between the saloon owner and the naked cowboy, then checks on Dean again. "And you're just being a good man playing hero?"

Dean shrugs. "What can I say, just another day of my life."

The Sheriff snorts, turning to the cowboy. "How many horses do you have, Mike?"

"Five." He answers.

"Alright, here's the deal. By spring, you take two of the finest horses and bring them here to Skinny. And we call it even. What do you say?" The Sheriff convicts.

"What, nothing for the girl there?" Dean blurts out, feeling ridiculous. "She's disfigured! He just ruined her whole life!"

"Why don't you wed her if you're so concerned?" Little Bill retorts.

*What an asshole.* Dean stares at the man's face, forgetting for a second he's in their land and time, wants nothing more than giving him, the shitty cowboy and the skinny saloon owner, one punch at nose for each of them. *Call it justice.*

"You are not even gonna whip him?" The elder lady heckles in disbelief.

"Isn't there enough blood shed?" The Sheriff does not look back at the ladies, simply nods at the crowds. The conviction is concluded. "Gentlemen, good night." He heads out.

The two deputies untie their hands and follow him out.

Dean exercises his numb wrist, glancing at the cowboy Mike, wondering how stupid of a move it would be if he gives him a punch again. The Sheriff is barely out of the saloon.

"Off you go, nothing to see now." Skinny shoos the crowd. "Have a good night. And you, Mr. Eastwood --" That's the name Dean registered with earlier. "-- Enough of playing hero, my girls don't need a prince in white horse, they have me. Better if you get going, you understand?"

Dean throws a glimpse at the girls again. The poor wounded one stops crying now, the other girls help wrap a gauze on her face like a pirate's blinder. Blood reddens the cloth. She looks at him, desperate, helpless. Eyes pleading. Hatred shines when she glances at the man who owns her and the man who disfigures her. But it is so clear that there is nothing she can do.

Dean takes his eyes back, walking slowly toward the counter. "Oh, I understand." He says slowly, stopping at an arm's distance away from Skinny. "But you see, I didn't come riding white horse, I came in black."

He gives the man a punch in the face. His own knuckle pained with scratches and blood just by the force in it. But it feels good. It feels right.

He reaches for his collar, aiming for a second blow. The man rises with a pistol in his hand. There is another click of gun safety switch behind his back. Dean doesn't need to look back to know who it belongs to. The girls gasp.

He releases the saloon owner, hands relaxing slowly, but edging toward the holster.

"Should have killed you when I got the chance." The cowboy says.

*Two on one. An odd chance, but not impossible.* Dean calculates. Clint Eastwood definitely could take down more than that number and make a good story. And good thing, he does have two pistols.

"Yes you should." He answers slowly. "Because now you're gonna die."

He can see the man's hand shaking. The pupils dilate. The index finger twitching on the trigger. The dark outlet of the pistol points at his heart menacingly.

Dean holds his breath. His own fingers are inches away from his pistols. The tension vibrates in the air.

Then all of a sudden, at the very same second, four gun shots go out.

Dean ducks to the ground, two pistols in hand, both smoking hot remnants of a shot. A bullet broke a glass on the bar stand. Mike lies on the ground, a bullet hole on the chest, bleeding red, already dead. Skinny falls behind the counter, moaning loud, a hole on his shoulder.

Dean stands up, without a scratch, scrutinizing the naked dead cowboy. "Think twice next time before being an asshole." He spits at him, knowing the other man behind the counter can hear him.

The wounded girl murmurs a heartfelt "Thank you" to him when he passes her to gather his belongs upstairs. And Dean returns a short nod.

This is just gonna be another town that he can never come back.
