Life on the road on horseback and life on the road in a car have more similarities than Dean ever realized. Like the quietness at night, the road and space all dark, when it seems the whole world dissolves, leaving only him and the Baby floating in space.

Except, with the black horse, with its rising and falling rhythm of muscle, the feeling of being accompanied by some living, breathing thing is somehow so very soothing. Almost as if he's accompanied by someone he knows.

Dean presses his palms on the horse's back, just to feel its heartbeat. Then slowly feeling his own heartbeat calming down.

He looks up at the starry sky, closing his eyes, exhaling deeply, smelling the sand and bushes. *Where are you, man?* He can't help thinking, not even sure if that's a prayer or just a haunting thought replaying itself in his mind.

He lets the horse decide the road for him, leaving his own mind wandering -- that's another similar yet different experience from driving, one he can actually take his eyes off the road long enough and no need to worry about crashing into some other incoming vehicles.

When the night sinks deep into the dark and cold hour, he lets the horse rest. Finding a relatively soft spot on the sandy land, wrapping himself in the blanket, he rests his eyes for a handful of hours. Then moves on again before the sun fully rises.

Dean thinks about that illustration image of the time flux all the time. The shape of a river, and a floating leaf flowing down the stream. He feels exactly like that floating leaf now.

<br>

There are towns scattered here and there across the western lands like stars in the night sky. Without a map, Dean doesn't know exactly how to find one, but the horse knows the way better than he does. Sometimes he wonders how many places she has already been to.

She leads them into a small town, its name reading "Thunderhill, Colorado," according to the wooden plaque swinging outside the town.

The place looks like a replica of Sunrise, Wyoming, except the main road through town is wider. Men in fine, well-tailored suits come and go on horseback, ladies in delicate, laborious dresses. The view is actually somewhat pleasant to enjoy, but Dean is not here for sightseeing.

He goes into the saloon -- at least this has to be universal in all times and places, there must always be a saloon in each and every western town, for his comfort.

The girls are more enthusiastic and younger here than Elkins' place. Dean meets their eyes -- they are old-time good-looking, mostly. They grin at him with professional smiles and practiced cheer, Dean walks toward the owner of the place and asks for a room.

"You want to pick one you like?" the skinny man behind the counter asks meaningfully, nodding at the girls.

Dean glances back, finding their eyes intensely on his back. He gives a short chuckle, "Nah, just for sleeping."

"Your loss," the man makes a face, pointing him to the stairway.

He should probably start planning his grand criminal plan sometime soon. Dean thinks as he drags his steps up the stairs, feeling his bones and muscles complaining about sleeping on the wild ground for too many nights in a row. It's making his joints and neck stiff and wrecked like a beat-up car. He has to have at least one decent night before thinking about some big history-breaking-level moves.

Dean throws himself onto the bed that smells of something suspicious, but probably not too different from all those cheap motels he has been used to his whole life. Dean falls asleep like that without bothering to take his clothes off.

He is woken up several hours later by some loud crying and yelling from next door. A man is angrily shouting "Whore!" and cursing, while a girl is screaming helplessly. Something crashes to the floor, shattering into pieces.

Dean jumps to his feet, dashing out to the next room without thinking.

A man twice bigger than him is standing on the lone bed in the center of the room, all naked and hairy, holding a knife in his hand high above his head, almost touching the ceiling.

The crying girl curls in the corner of the bed like a startled little creature, wrapping herself up in her arms, covering her face with her fingers. Unclothed and crying loudly, screaming for her life. Blood streaming between her fingers.

Dean recognizes her from the group of saloon ladies who greeted him when he arrived.

He approaches the man carefully, eyeing the knife, closing the distance between them, tone demanding, "Why don't you put the knife down and let's talk?"

The man glances back at him for a split second, grumbling, "Go away. None of your business."

"It's my business because I was woken up," Dean takes another step closer, barely a dive's distance away from him now. He tries to hint to the girl to get away while the man's distracted, but she's just too busy crying. He can't tell where the blood is coming from and it worries him.

"Very well," the man snarls. "I'll deal with you once I kill the bitch."

"Can't let you do that." Dean charges the remaining two steps in a heartbeat, arms dragging around the man's waist, pulling him off balance and falling off the bed. The knife is still in his hand.

The man struggles violently and breaks loose from Dean's hold, fumbling to his feet, throwing himself at him.

Dean gets pinned to the ground under the weight, wrestling with every fighting skill he's picked up over the years, but battle techniques for everyday monsters are not as useful against a pissed-off cowboy when he's not trying to kill him.

The man fights like a gorilla, ending up straddling him with one hand pressing on Dean's chest, stopping him from getting away, the other hand pressing the tip of the knife against his cheek. "You should keep your nose clean," he grits the yellow teeth.

The knife feels cold against his skin. Dean wonders how much he can move his head before it stabs through his skull.

"Cleaner than yours," Dean barks back, staring the man in the eyes deadly focused as if they're in a gun duel. He moves suddenly, so quick that the other doesn't have time to react, and Dean already breaks his hands free. He twists his wrist in a way sharply that the man has to loosen the hold of the knife, and the next second, the knife lands in Dean's hand.

Just in the blink of an eye, their positions shift. Dean holds the knife an inch from the man's neck, close enough to make his point clear. The man stills.

Dean demands, "Now you wanna explain what's the matter with the lady?"

Right at this moment, three men burst into the room, all in uniforms, with a sheriff's pin gleaming on the chest of the leading aged man.

"Put down your knife, for Christ's sake!" Three shotguns point straight at him. The Sheriff steps closer, solemnly, eyes moving between Dean and the man in his grasp.

Dean knows better than to bring a knife to a gunfight with three cowboy lawmen.

He lets his hand fall and gets tied behind his back with a rough rope by a deputy. The other guy is tied to the same wooden stake hammered into the ground.

The Sheriff glares between them. "Now, talk!"

Dean purses his mouth, glancing at the girl in dismay at his rescue.

An older lady is tending to her wounds. She removes her hand very slowly and reluctantly from her face. Tears are still falling unstoppably. A long, bloody cut diagonalizes across her young, pretty face, narrowly missing her eyes, but slicing all the way from her forehead down across her cheek, reaching the edge of her jaw. One that will undoubtedly leave a permanent scar on that face for life.

The man tied behind him grumbles, "That crazy man came out of nowhere and wanted to kill me, you saw how he moved with a knife. I had to defend myself."

Dean rolls his eyes. Should have known, son of bitches around here always mouthful of lies. "Only because he was two seconds away from killing that lady."

"Bitch had it coming," he growls. Dean can feel his shrug against their tied-together backs.

"What did she do?" the Sheriff asks.

The naked cowboy doesn't answer.

"Mike, what did she do?"

"She chuckled when she saw his tiny junk, that's what." The older lady turns from cleaning the wounds on the girl's face, speaking on her behalf, snapping harshly. "Now look what he's done! She's ruined!"

She's not wrong, his junk dangled pitifully as he moved around earlier. Dean has to stifle a chuckle of his own, but the crowd around them isn't as generous. The cowboy Mike growls something under his breath, the sound throttled in his throat like a caged tiger huffing.

The skinny man behind the counter chimes in. "There has to be justice, Little Bill. Who would want a whore with a scarred face? I bought her last spring, and she's damaged goods now. She could've served for another five, ten years."

*Wow.* Dean thinks. *Talk about authenticity. The rural, cruel world for the ladies is just part of this era. Those classic movies aren't kidding.*

Sheriff Little Bill glances between the saloon owner and the naked cowboy, then checks on Dean again. "And you're just being a good man, playing hero?"

Dean shrugs. "What can I say? Just another day of my life."

The Sheriff snorts, turning to the cowboy. "How many horses do you have, Mike?"

"Five," he answers.

"Alright, here's the deal. By spring, you take two of the finest horses and bring them here to Skinny. And we call it even. What do you say?" The Sheriff declares.

"What, nothing for the girl there?" Dean blurts out, feeling ridiculous. "She's disfigured! He just ruined her whole life!"

"Why don't you wed her if you're so concerned?" Little Bill retorts.

*What an asshole.* Dean stares at the man's face, forgetting momentarily he's in their land and time, and wants nothing more than to give him, the shitty cowboy, and the skinny saloon owner, one punch to the nose for each of them. *Call it justice.*

"You are not even gonna whip him?" The older lady heckles in disbelief.

"Isn't there enough bloodshed?" The Sheriff does not look back at the ladies, simply nodding at the crowd. The verdict is concluded. "Gentlemen, good night." He heads out.

The two deputies untie their hands and follow him out.

Dean flexes his numb wrist, glancing at the cowboy Mike, wondering how stupid a move it would be if he gives him a punch again. The Sheriff is barely out of the saloon.

"Off you go, nothing to see now." Skinny shoos the crowd. "Have a good night. And you, Mr. Eastwood --" That's the name Dean registered with earlier. "-- Enough of playing hero, my girls don't need a prince on a white horse, they have me. Better if you get going, you understand?"

Dean throws a glance at the girls again. The poor wounded one has stopped crying now, the other girls help wrap a gauze on her face like a pirate's blindfold. Blood reddens the cloth. She looks at him, desperate, helpless. Eyes pleading. Hatred shines when she glances at the man who owns her and the man who disfigured her. But it is so clear that there is nothing she can do.

Dean takes his gaze back, walking slowly toward the counter. "Oh, I understand," he says slowly, stopping at arm's length from Skinny. "But you see, I didn't come riding in on a white horse, I came in black."

He punches the man in the face. His knuckle ache with scratches and blood from the force, but it feels damn good. It feels right.

He reaches for his collar, aiming for a second blow. The man rises with a pistol in his hand. There is another click of a gun safety switch behind his back. Dean doesn't need to look back to know who it belongs to. The girls gasp.

He releases the saloon owner, his hands relaxing slowly, but edging toward the holster.

"Should have killed you when I had the chance," the cowboy says.

*Two on one. An odd chance, but not impossible,* Dean calculates. Clint Eastwood could definitely take down more than that number and make a good story. And good thing, he does have two pistols.

"Yes, you should," Dean answers slowly. "Because now you're gonna pay."

He can see the man's hand shaking. The pupils dilate. The index finger twitches on the trigger. The dark muzzle of the pistol points at his heart menacingly.

Dean holds his breath. His own fingers are inches away from his pistols. The tension vibrates in the air.

Then all of a sudden, at the very same second, four gunshots ring out.

Dean ducks to the ground, two pistols in hand, both smoking hot from the shots. A bullet broke a glass on the bar stand. Mike lies on the ground, a bullet hole in his stomach, bleeding red, gasping painfully for breath. Skinny falls behind the counter, groaning loudly, a hole in his shoulder.

Dean stands up, without a scratch, scrutinizing the naked bleeding cowboy. "Think twice next time before being an asshole." He spits at him, knowing the other man behind the counter can hear him.

The wounded girl murmurs a heartfelt "Thank you" to him as he passes her on his way to gather his belongings upstairs. Dean returns a short nod.

This is just gonna be another town he can never come back to.
