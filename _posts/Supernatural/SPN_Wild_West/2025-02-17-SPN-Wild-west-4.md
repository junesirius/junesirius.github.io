"This is stupid, even for you." The thundering voice sounds up above him. Cas doesn't need to look up to know who has found him.

The stab pierces through the abdomen of the vessel, but even worse for his true form. The outer ring gets a deep cut through, almost reaching the middle ring. The root of one of the right wings is also wounded. He can barely fly straight.

It's like leaving blood trace behind in the open sea, he thinks remotely. He's the drowning swimmer, attracting the sharks.

"Thought I can at least have a head start before you catch up." Cas answers. Beating his wings the hardest he can. The pain tears through his wings with each slap. But he has to keep going.

Below them, the time flux is flowing, bright and sparkling. Almost like flying in the space, appreciating the galaxy. In a way, time is no different from space.

"So you know I'd found you, sooner or later." Raphael amuses. The flow from the archangel's wings disturbs this time dimension like a tornado sweeping through wild plain. "I didn't know you're the suicidal type."

"Not suicidal." Cas dives lower, avoiding the central turbulence, trying to use the left wings to remedy the wounds on the right side. He doesn't bother checking if the bleeding of grace is getting worse. The bondage Bobby helped wrapping him with didn't do anything. His essence is running out fast.

He's running out of time too.

It's actually funny. Cas's mind somehow wanders away. If Dean is here, he'd definitely make a remark about how you can even running out of time when you're literally *in* the time dimension, scouting the time flux.

He can't think of any joke himself.

Not suicidal, but just for finding the brothers. He just need enough time to find them before Raphael gets a hold of him, and undoubtfully smiting him.

The time flux has an urgent turn around nineteenth century, with the Civil War and everything, the history is not so easy to make out. Cas squints his eyes, focusing on the reflections in the time flux --

That's when he loses his balance suddenly. A harsh tear on tip of his top left wing makes him gasp in pain, the inner ring shrinks in reflex, like how a human would yell and jump back at an unexpected strike of pain.

Cas curls his left wings for self-protection, dropping the flying height. Raphael's big shadow swooping right on top of him, like an eagle diving for its prey sparrow.

He manages a sharp turn avoiding the attack. The tip of the lower wings dipping into the time flux, catching a damp from the early twentieth century.

Cas resets his rings and wings, swirling backwards.

"You do know it is pointless to fight or hide from me, do you?" Raphael mocks, turning around as well, following him two wings' distance away.

"How do you find me?" Cas asks, hoping vainly that this might distract the archangel for at least a split of heartbeat time, while widening all his eyes scattered on his rings to scan through the time flux while he flies. It's been a while since he has to fight in the time dimension in his true form, even longer to have to find a soul in here, if ever.

But surely the familiarity and the profound bound should make it slight easier? Cas starts getting anxious, finding the time flux all look the same and more confusingly dazzling than he remembers. Something is going on in these western times, but he doesn't know what if he's not there, but Dean is there, going through the weird time and history on his own, without wing and without protection.

Cas flaps his wings more rapidly, bearing all the tearing feeling in the rings and wings. Not caring the more rapid speed the grace is losing, spilling from his true form like dripping blood along the way.

Then for the second time, the disturbance in the air hits him sharp from the center, he almost falls directly into the time flux below.

The archangel didn't even unleash his supernova-explosion-level grace, just using the tip of his wings that are as sharp as any metal in the universe that can ever be, almost cutting him in half.

Castiel screams in pain in his true voice. The time dimension echoes his sound. Raphael laughs behind him in satisfaction.

"I can smell your bleeding grace from two galaxies away, Castiel." Raphael tells him, the satisfying tone is still there. "Let alone that human you hang out with, Bobby gave us a loud and clear coordinate. So give up, Castiel, you can't hide from me in any time or space. I will always find you, and I will always destroy you."

The second swing of cutting comes from the other side, Cas hears it coming before it hits him, he ducks sideways. The archangel's feathers are like natural angel blade, it scratches his innermost ring, missing the heart of his essence by mere inches.

He could be killed any minute now. Cas thinks bitterly. And then Dean and Sam would be trapped in the western wasteland in the past, forever. They won't even reach the time when the first Impala was ever produced when they die of old age -- if they die of old age. They won't ever come back home again.

Cas blinks his eyes hard, opening all his wings again, wounded or not, shooting upwards. Directly into Raphael from below. The rings around his essence rotate fast and urgent, like a rapidly beating heart.

Raphael doesn't expect the change of direction in his moves. He has no time of diverting.

Cas uses his whole existence as bullet, the momentum as the fuel, hitting Raphael in his most vulnerable ring -- the same part where Cas is beating and rotating glaringly, the innermost ring around the essence. Raphael is pushed out of balance, for a split of heartbeat, out of control of where he's heading.

Castiel catches the blink of opportunity when Raphael is not looking at him, diving straight into the time flux below him.

The time dimension swirls and spins around him, sucking him into the point he chooses. The speed of rotation makes his rings twist and deform. No wonder every time he pops Dean in and out, he'd complain about motion sickness. This must be the exactly dizziness a human would feel if he doesn't have any grace left.

The thought makes his heart thumps hard.

Did he lose all the grace just coming for them? How's he gonna take the boys home now?

Disregardless of still answerless to any of his questions, his feet land on the solid ground again. Castiel tumbles ahead, dropping on his all fours, spitting blood onto the sandy ground in front of him. The view is swimming, the ground is floating up and down as if he's being washed away by the tide. He has to focus very hard to not let the cold, shaky limbs give way here and now.

Wind blows, the sand rises around him. The vessel coughs, more blood dripping, not just from his mouth.

Cas only gets time to see the wooden sign saying "Sunrise, WYO." before the world turns total black.
