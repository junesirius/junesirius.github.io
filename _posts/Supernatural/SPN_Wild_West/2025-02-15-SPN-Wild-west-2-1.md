"Get out of my house." Samuel Colt grumbles, without bothering to lift his head. His colt on the desk by his hand -- a normal one, not the special one he'd already given them.

"I'm really sorry to bother you again," Sam steps gingerly ahead, Dean follows him a few steps behind. "I wouldn't bother you if it's not absolutely urgent."

"Thought I already did my share of help." He eyes them. "Don't tell me the Colt didn't work on the creature you're hunting."

"No, it's not that," Dean chimes in. "It worked, but uh... it's something else we could use a little help here."

"What part of *I'm retired* failed you?"

*Jesus, Samuel is clearly not an easy one to work with.* Dean thinks quietly, eyebrows raised a few inches higher.

"Like I said, in our time, you're sort of a really big deal, the most famous hunter -- " Sam manages a tight smile, as friendly as he can muster.

"Heard you the first time."

"So we figured you'd be the best supernatural researcher around here too." Dean pulls a puffing grin with his best effort.

"Please, we are not asking you to hunt with us or anything," Sam continues. "Just need a little help with research."

<br>

It turns out their guess isn't too far off. Samuel has as big a book collection as Bobby or the Campbells, tucked right downstairs in the place where a cellar should be, but with tons more additional traps and sigils painted over every inch of the floor and walls.

Panic room *and* library, nice. *Classic.* Dean looks around, thinking how *fun* it must be to be able to spend all the time reading while hiding out here.

Sam nudges him, eyeing the rows of books. Dean nods back.

Research time.

<br>

"Don't you think if there were a way to pull it off here and now, someone would have done that already?" Dean puts a book down after god knows how many hours, wiping his face with his hands, giving his brain a break. "Then why didn't we ever run into people time-traveled from the past all the time?"

Sam doesn't move his eyes away from whatever he's scanning. "They don't know what we know," he deadpans.

*But they don't know much about this time thing, either.* Dean thinks. It's always just Cas swinging them around, or some other douchebag angels occasionally. Just popping in and out, not really much theory or science to learn about.

Should've probably asked a few more questions about how the time flux thing works. He realizes belatedly. But after all, not everyone is as nerdy as Sam.

"I just remember Cas said once that time travel isn't easy but not impossible," Dean thinks hard, poking into some corner of old memories, the time when he met Mom and Dad when they were younger than his was, the other time when they tried to stop the yellow-eyed demon but still failed miserably, even the time when he got flipped to the messed-up five years into the zombie land future that turned out never would come to pass. What did Cas tell him during those short talks?

"He said that time is fluid, it's not easy, but apparently the angels have no problem bending it once in a while."

Sam jerks his head up, eyes bright with understanding, "And he also told us this time before we left, that the further back he sent us, the harder it becomes to retrieve us, that's why he said we couldn't stay more than twenty four hours, or we'd be lost to him."

"Which means we are totally lost to him by now and no way home without the wings," Dean says bitterly.

"No, Dean!" Sam jumps to his feet. "That might be the idea! This book here also says something similar, quite many are saying the same thing actually, I just didn't realize they might be literal, thought it's more metaphorical."

He slides the book over with some illustration that looks like a river with sandbanks on its sides. "Imagine time is like a river or something, fluid, a rapid turbulence flow of some kind, and each of us is like a floating leaf. Cas can bend the waterway so it becomes non-chronological, the downstream touches the upstream, that's how we landed here. And folding some part off would be to fast-forward into the future. But if we stay here too long, we are like the leaves washed too far downstream by the flow, that's probably why he can't find us, because he doesn't know where we are in the time flux anymore."

Dean's brows knit into a knot. "So... if we make some noise, *splash!* Fish jump out of the water, we can make ourselves stand out in this timeline river somehow, so he can find us."

"Like temporal beacons. It might work -- assuming Cas is still out there looking for us." Sam's voice gets quieter at the last part.

"He's out there," Dean says reflexively. Sam doesn't look convinced.

Dean gives the river drawing another look, thinking it over again, a minor smile starts creeping onto his face. "Sounds like a plan to me. What kind of noise are we talking about?"

Sam looks a little caught by the question, shrugging uncertainly. "How would I know? Something big enough to get some notice in the future, I guess? I would definitely notice if your face showed up in some old western posters, guess you can finally make a name for yourself in this era, like you always wanted, huh?"

Sam throws a half-smile in his brother's direction, knowing him too well.

Dean's eyes glint. "Any catch I need to know before messing up the time?"

The tip of Sam's mouth twitches. "Just like you said but, eh... don't mess up the time too much? Butterfly effect, remember? We just came back from the Titanic world like, last week?"

Dean returns an unimpressed look. "Let me, umm, just try one more time before any big moves, just to be sure."

Glancing up, he prays hard and loud, "Castiel, Angel of the Lord, if you have your ears on, come pick us up here, alright? Or we're gonna do something that can *possibly* break history, you hear me?"

He waits. One second. Two seconds. Three seconds. No stir of air, no fluttering wings, no feathered angel. No Cas.

Dean breathes out. "Okay then, let's do this, make some noise! Fun time!"

"Umm," Sam has a look of reluctance, slowly sitting back down.

Dean narrows his eyes. "You're not coming with me."

Sam spreads his hands wide, empty palms facing up -- all they have is a big pile of nothing. Resigned, he says, "Look, Dean, I know how much faith you have in Cas, I really hope I do too, but we just don't know. We could break history and the timeline and everything, and Cas might never come, and we would still be stuck here. I'm gonna find another way, a spell or something, things we can do *by ourselves*, swim our way back if we can."

"And you'll just stay here the whole time, researching?" Dean throws a quick glance at the stairs leading out of the cellar. "Samuel here doesn't look like he welcomes guests, let alone long-term tenants."

"Not too different from Bobby?" Sam curls up his lips a little.

Dean considers, huffing a quiet laugh. "Yeah, right, we are professionals in handling half-retired grumpy old drunk hunters."

They exchange an agreeing look. So it is decided.

Dean stands up, moving around the table, leaning in to give his brother a half-hug.

"See you around then, Sammy." He pats his back slightly before pulling away. "I'll drop by to pick you up after I find Cas."

"And how do I find you, if I find the spell?" Sam asks.

Dean grins. "Read the newspaper."

<br>

"So, you finally decide to move on?" Elkins gives him a once-over. "Where's the other tall guy?"

Dean has a red bandana wrapped around his mouth. He's changed into a new shirt and pants -- new for him, old for the clothes -- dirt and stains making him look exactly like the rest of the folks in the place.

*The look of a pilgrim,* Dean realizes.

He doesn't answer. Just strides straight into the room, heading directly for the bartender they've grown familiar with over the past couple of days. Dean lets out a breath, tasting a tad of bitterness lingering on the tip of his tongue.

Drawing the pistol from the holster at his waist in a smooth swing, he fires three shots into the ceiling. Some girls scream behind him.

Elkins looks at him, reaching for something hidden beneath the bar stand. Supposedly a shotgun.

"I suggest not," Dean shifts his aim toward him. The bartender stops moving, hands slowly rising.

"What's this about?" The old man is still surprisingly chill, not even showing much curiosity.

*Just how many gangsters has he run into before?* Dean finds himself wondering.

"What every outlaw around here wants," he says, aiming for a deep, grave voice. "You got any hidden treasure around here? Gold would do just fine."

"At least leave me a name to pass your story along?" Elkins slowly reaches toward a side drawer in his gaze. The gold he offers includes some of the very pieces they paid for their meals over the past few days. Dean has to push down the unease.

"Eastwood. Clint Eastwood. Best gunner in the western world," Dean tells him, with a mocking smile.

"We'll see about that." Three gunshots are released in the next second. Not Dean's this time. He dives behind an overturned dining table. A bullet narrowly misses his cheek, the air squealing sharp and heated.

"Son of a bitch!" He shouts. Dirt from the ground flies into the air, the room turns hazy for a second. He can't see much.

Dean blinks hard, looking left and right, trying to figure out what now.

"What the hell?" he thinks out loud. Guess the first rodeo isn't always very successful even for bonafide western gangsters.

"Well, *Hell* sends regards." Elkins' steps thud right in front of the table. Dean risks a glimpse, catching sight of black eyes.

"Freaking demon!" He growls, at the same time ducking into a gap between the stools, exactly when the table he was hiding behind gets shot a bullet hole around the place where his heart would have been.

A second gunshot is fired from behind him. Dammit, *demons*, plural. A whackload of them, it seems.

He hears giggling from the same direction where the gunshot comes, the place where the saloon ladies usually gather. If they are all possessed, he counts four already.

Even with the Colt he hasn't really had the upper hand against that many demons all at once, and god knows how many more might be crawling in as they speak.

"Surprised to see us?" Elkins' voice cuts through, harsh and edgy, nothing like how he used to sound when he spoke with them before. "We kill everyone close to Samuel Colt, just so you know."

"Huh, usually the other way around," Dean amuses. "So this is what it's like hanging around with a big name."

"You some big name, boy?" the demon inside Elkins smirks.

"That's the goal," Dean answers absently, tightening his grip on the pistol, silently counting the bullets he has left. *A bit low on ammo already,* he thinks, shifting the grip slightly. *Gotta figure a way out fast*.

The exit door is two tables away, with the three lady demons in between, but the side window is only one table away, with buckets of alcohol within range. He calculates his route.

The demons circle closer. Their footsteps heavy, the rustling of their dresses relentless.

Dean risks another look from the edge of his hideout. All of them have guns in their hands. *Since when do demons kill humans with guns? Western cowboy demons?* He teases the thought, finding it not as unpleasant as he would have thought.

The demon possessing the bartender lets out a raspy laugh. "You will die, Clint Eastwood."

"Huh, it's actually nice hearing people say that, you know. Sorta the point, could be a line for the movies." Dean estimates the timing and distance, then swings a stool at the foot of the closest demon girl, diving sideways. Darla, the saloon girl cornered him the first day, yells angrily, her eyes flashing black, swooping for him.

"Sorry about that," Dean says, a bit apologetically. Then diving for the bucket stack and kicking them loose.

A bucket rolls into the center of the saloon, alcohol leaking from a crack, leaving a wet trail as it goes. The second one follows, making the trail a spreading pool, soaking the next one inside out.

Dean leaps out of the place through the window right before the demons shoot the spot he had been. Bullets and sparks catch the alcohol, the whole place turns into a roaring pile of flame and smoke in seconds. Demons hiss furiously inside.

The second floor crumbles down in the fire. Dean only then realizes he forgot to check if there were any humans up there, but it's too late already.

He unleashes the horse from the stable and gallops out of the town, heading west without looking back.

<br>

He doesn't slow down until the burning hut is completely out of view. The sun is setting ahead of him on the horizon. He eases the reins, letting the horse stroll.

Dean glances back at the wild plain territory behind him, barely anything to see. Barren and wild, cactus and weeds growing from the sand, no sign of civilization.

"No coming back to Sunrise, Wyoming now," he sighs, patting the duffel bag and roll of blanket strapped tightly to the horse's back, the same way he'd check the Impala's trunk to make sure he had everything he needs for the road.

Dean removes the Sheriff's pin from his shirt. "Didn't expect the first gig to end up like that, goddamn demons always ruin the day."

He strokes the horse's neck gently, speaking to her as much as to himself. "What do you think, that's a loud enough distress call for Cas or not?"

He looks up at the sky. Night is falling slowly, the color transitioning from dark blue to deep purple. Some stars that are incredibly bright and shining already start blinking above these lands. Light pollution isn't a thing yet. He wonders if they look the same a hundred fifty years into the future.

The pure universe hanging on top of him like a gigantic globe, celestial, but not in a biblical way.

Dean lets his fingers comb through the horse's hair, feeling the creature's muscles rise and fall as she jogs. "Yeah, I know," he says quietly, "Probably not."

Him not being home already is proof by itself.

"Looks like it's just you and me and the whole wild west now, Baby," he pats the horse. "Come on then, let's head west and make some more noise, he's gotta hear one of 'em. Good thing all the land between here and the ocean is free to go."

The whole wild west ahead of him, free to explore.

But Dean isn't anywhere near ecstatic. It's just too damn far from home.
