The ranch they pointed him to belongs to the Ludlow family. The father raises three boys, and there is a family of Native Americans as helpers.

Cas learns the way of ranch life fast enough, and spends most of his time with the livestock. They ask if he needs a better place to spend the night, and he tells them he will be fine. He needed some sleep like humans do for the first two or three years, and then it's just long, dark nights after nights, alone, outside the helper's hut, staring at the sky, thinking, wondering. He might have accidentally fallen asleep once in a long while, but the body's need for sleep diminishes as his grace recovers slowly -- agonizingly slow, but he doesn't have anything else to do.

The wings heal slower than the rest of the body, and he can't risk using his grace to help -- not like there is enough of healing power left anyway -- in case the archangel is still scouting the time flux and watching out for the light reflecting from his standout existence that doesn't belong to this era.

So he just lives, and waits. Waiting for the time to pass, second by second, minute by minute, like all humans do, like all of history does. Waiting for his body and true form to recover in the oldest way, like all humans do. Waiting for his strength and grace to grow back.

The little Native American girl grows from a child to a young woman, then comes of age. The Ludlow boys grow fast too. Cas watches them grow from babbling babies to strong young men.

Time is a funny thing. It feels one way when they as angels watch mankind evolve from the top of the clouds and thousands of years pass in a snap, and becomes so utterly a different thing as it flows and moves forward one day after another, then one year after another.

The old man of the Ludlow family passes away at the fifteenth year after Cas joins the ranch. They host a proper funeral in the traditional way. By nightfall, the oldest son plays the harp and the youngest one sings a beautiful song. The second son isn't with them, he's probably in the woods again, looking for bears to fight.

Cas sits at the corner, away from the bonfire and the family, thinking absent-mindedly that the scene feels too familiar. He thinks about Dean, in moments like this. He wonders where Dean is and if he's safe. He checks the time, then the date, then the year. There are still five years to wait, until 1861 comes.

For the whole year of 1860, Cas is restless. He attends to the cows, feeds the chickens and pigs, cleans the stable, brushes the horses, and then, with all the work done, he goes into the woods for a walk. That's what he tells the Ludlows.

He doesn't just take a walk in the woods, he goes deep east. Across the east side of the state line, he goes to South Dakota. He goes to the land where the town of Sioux Falls will be, and he goes to the place where Bobby's house and yard will stand. The place they leave behind, and the place that hasn't been built. The land is undeveloped yet. Cas just stays there, standing in the spot his memory tells him should be the right spot, lowering the body, touching the sand and dirt on the ground, wondering if those exact dirt remains the same for the whole one hundred and fifty years into the future. The solid ground gives him a tiny sense of comfort. But the human heart in his body still beats restlessly, he knows the rings in his true form would be spinning with a similar uneasy speed.

He goes back to the ranch after that. The sun of the new day hasn't risen yet. He goes back to check the stable and the fences, the family in the house, and the Native American family in the helper's hut. The next day is no different.

And then, finally, the year 1861 comes, and March arrives. On the day of March the fourth, 1861, the day he knows Dean and Sam will be in Sunrise, Wyoming, because he would -- had -- dropped them here. Cas goes back to the town, waiting, out of their sight -- things that would have happened to the brothers, Cas doesn't know what will happen if the time flow is disturbed twice, so he decides, it should be safer to avoid the whole paradox by showing up only when he is supposed to.

He goes into the saloon, before noon on the fourth. The bartender Jim Elkins regards him as he walks in. The young man he once was has turned aged and bearded, but the eyes are still sharp. The place smells like horse dung and hay now.

"I remember you," he tells Cas. "You look exactly the same as twenty years ago."

Cas gives him a quick smile. "You have a good memory."

The man looks proud of himself.

Cas books a room with the ranch salary he earned over the past years, with all the extras to pay for those very first few days he was here two decades ago.

He stays on the second floor and decides not to leave the room until high noon on the fifth.

When the footsteps of Dean and Sam walk into the place, when their voices pass to the second floor, it takes him everything not to rush downstairs to meet them.

Cas sits on the bed, closing his eyes, breathing in and out, deep, counting his own heartbeat. He hears Dean complaining about the drink, and saying his own name being "Clint Eastwood." Cas clenches his fist, pinning his body down, reminding himself, *He has waited twenty years, he can wait another day*.

The Judge yells in pain when the phoenix creature burns him alive and the saloon girl screams. The Winchester brothers dash to the second floor. Cas snaps open his eyes. Dean's voice is right next door to his room. He's hidden from his angelic eyes, and the wall blocks his human sight. Cas can't see him, but every atom in his body and every photon in his true form vibrates in anticipation. Dean is *right there*.

Cas thinks he might break the bones in his fist if he clenches any harder.

Every syllable coming from Dean, every word and every sentence, Cas listens to them intently, absorbing them into his memory. He doesn't realize how much he missed it. And he doesn't even know it's possible to miss like this, it almost terrifies him.

He holds himself still, and he hears them leave the room.

The night comes and goes. When the sun rises, a sense of unease starts crawling up. A shade of evil looms over this place, and Cas opens his true eyes to scout.

Elkins enters his room without knocking, and Cas sees the demon's face behind the vessel.

Cas rushes up, manifesting his angel blade into his palm. Two more demons crowd into the room, both taking the form of saloon ladies, another two wait in the hallway.

He swings the blade at the one possessing the poor bartender, the demon smirks harshly. "Careful, don't want to hurt the good old man in here, he's still awake." The eyes of the demon flash back to human for a second, the bartender looks at him in frantic confusion and panic, and then the eyes switch back to the demon's black eyes.

Fighting demons while trying not to harm the possessed human is like disarming a bomb tied to a beating heart.

Cas hides the angel blade away in the pocket dimension, maneuvering between the demons, while murmuring the exorcism in Latin. It's been a while since he last saw a demon, let alone fighting one. The easy pace of ranch life has made him slack. The words stumble and the demons catch him off guard.

They trap him in the Enochian trap painted on the floor, and weaken him with more sigils on the wall. He can do nothing but scowl. He could have been able to break free if he were at his full power, but at the slow rate of recovery, he is no match.

This is a moment Cas wishes Dean could hear him like he hears his prayers.

He hears Dean's voice, talking with Sam.

He hears the sound of the gunshot, and the phoenix burning to ashes.

And he hears the clock bells tolling the tone of high noon.

Cas struggles, but the trap and sigils render him powerless.

Dean's voice comes through in prayer, calling his name, for the many days that followed. Cas hates himself for not being there when Dean needs him.

He breaks free when a fire tears down the whole place. The flames catch his clothes, threatening to burn his vessel. Cas manages to jump out of the window, landing in some bushes. Leaving only scratches on his skin.

The road has a fresh track of horse hooves. The way Dean left. Leading to a place Cas doesn't know.

Cas finds a horse with no owner, and follows the track toward the west.
