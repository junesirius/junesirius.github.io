The ranch they pointed him to belongs to the Ludlow family. The father raises three boys, and there are a family of Indians as helpers.

Cas learns the way of ranch life fast enough, and lives with the stocks for the most of the time. They asked him if he needs a better place to spend the night, and he told them he would be fine. He needed some sleep like humans do for the first two three years, and then it's just long dark nights after nights, alone, outside of the helper's hut, staring at the sky, thinking, wondering. He might has accidentally fallen asleep once in a long while, but the body's need of sleep reduces as the grace grows back slowly -- agonizingly slow, but he doesn't have anything else to do.

The wings recover slower than the rest of the body, and he can't risk using grace to help -- not like there is enough of healing power left anyway -- in case the archangel is still scouting the time flux and noticing the reflecting light from his standout existence that doesn't belong to this era.

So he just lives, and waits. Waiting for the time to pass seconds by seconds, minutes by minutes, like all humans do, like all the history do. Waiting for his body and the true form to recover in the oldest way, like all humans do. Waiting for his strength and grace to grow back.

The little Indian girl grows from a kid to a young lady, then comes of age. The Ludlow boys grow fast too. Cas watches them grow from babbling babies to strong, young men.

The time is a funny thing, it feels one way when they as angels watch the mankind involve from the top of the cloud and thousands of years pass within a snap, and becomes so utterly a differently thing as it flows and moves forward one day after another, then one year after another.

The old man of the Ludlow's family passes away at the fifteenth year after Cas joins the ranch. They host a proper funeral in the traditional way. By nightfall, the oldest son plays harper and the youngest one sings a beautiful song. The second son isn't with them, he's probably in the woods again, looking for bears to fight with.

Cas sits at the corner, away from the bonfire and the family, thinking absent-mindedly that the scene looks too familiar. He thinks about Dean, in moments like this. He wonders where Dean is and if he's safe. He checks the time, then the date, then the year. There are still five years to wait, until 1861 comes.

For the whole year of 1860, Cas is restless. He attends to the cows, feeds the chickens and pigs, cleans up the stable, brushes the horses, and then, with all the work done, he goes into the woods for a walk. That's what he tells the Ludlows.

He doesn't just take a walk in the woods, he goes far deep east. Across the east side of the state line, he goes to South Dakota. He goes to the land where the town of Sioux Falls would be, and he goes to the place where Bobby's house and yard would be. The place they leave behind, and the place that hasn't been built. The lands are undeveloped yet. Cas would just stay here, standing on the spot the memory tells him should be the right spot, lowering the body, touching the sand and dirt on the ground, wondering if those exact dirt remains the same for the whole one hundred and fifty years into the future. The solid ground gives him a tiniest sense of comfort. But the human heart in his body still bumps restlessly, he knows the rings in his true form would be spinning with a similar uneasy speed.

He goes back to the ranch after that. The sun of the next day doesn't rise yet. He goes back to check the stable and the fences, the family in the house, and the Indian family in the helper's hut. The next day is no difference.

And then, finally, the year of 1861 comes, the month of March comes. On the day of March the fourth, 1861, the day he knows Dean and Sam would be in the Sunrise, Wyoming, because he would -- had -- dropped them here. Cas goes back to the town, waiting, out of their sight -- things that would have happened to the brothers, Cas doesn't know what would happen if he disturbs the time flow twice, so he decides, it should be safer to avoid the whole paradox by showing up only after when he is supposed to show.

He goes into the saloon, before the noon of the fourth. The bartender Jim Elkins regards him as he walks in. The young man he once was turns aged and bearded, but the eyes are still sharp. The place smells like horse dung and hay now.

"I remember you." He tells Cas. "You look exactly the same as twenty years ago."

Cas gives him a quick smile. "You have good memory."

The man looks proud of himself.

Cas books a room with the ranch salary he earned in the past years, with all the extras to pay for those very first few days he was here last time.

He stays on the second floor and decides to not leave the room until the high noon of the fifth.

When the footsteps of Dean and Sam walk into the place, when their voices pass to the second floor, it takes him everything to not rushing downstairs to meet them.

Cas sits on the bed, closing his eyes, breathing in and out, deep, counting his own heartbeat. He hears Dean complaining about the drink, and saying his own name being "Clint Eastwood". He clenches the fist, pinning his body down, reminding himself, *he has waited for twenty years, he can wait for another day*.

The Judge yells in pain when the phoenix creature burns him and the saloon girl screams. The Winchester brothers dash to the second floor. Cas snaps open his eyes. Dean's voice is right next door to his room. He's hidden from his angelic eyes, and the wall blocks his human eyes. He can't see him, but every atom in his body and every photon in his true form vibrates in anticipation. He is right there.

Cas thinks he might break the bones in his fist if he clenches any harder.

Every syllable coming from Dean, every word and sentence, Cas listens to them, and absorbs into his memory. He doesn't realize how much he misses it. And he doesn't even know it's possible to miss like this, it almost terrifies him.

He holds himself still, and he hears them leave the room.

The night comes and goes. When the sun rises, a sense of unease starts crawling up. A shade of evil looms this place, and Cas opens his true eyes to scout.

Elkins enters his room without knock, and he sees a demon's face behind the vessel.

Cas rushes up, manifesting his angel blade into the palm. Two more demons crowd into the room, both taking the form of the saloon ladies, another two wait in the hallway.

He swings the blade at the one possesses the bartender, the demon smirks harshly, "Careful, don't want to hurt the old sir in here, he's still awake." The eyes of the demon flash back to human for a second, the bartender looks at him in frantic confusion and panic, and then they switch back to demon's black eyes.

Fighting the demons while trying to not harm the human vessels is like disarming a bomb that is tied to a beating heart.

Cas hides the angel blade away in the pocket dimension, maneuvering between the demons, murmuring the exorcism in Latin. It's been a while since last time he sees a demon, let alone fighting one. The easy pace of ranch life has made him slack. The words stumble and demons catch him off guard.

They trap him in the Enochian trap painted on the floor, and weaken him with more sigils on the wall. He can do nothing but scowl. He would have been able to break free if he's at his full power, but at the slow rate of recovery, he is no match.

This is a moment Cas wishes Dean can hear him like he hears his prayer.

He hears Dean's voice, talking with Sam.

He hears sound of the gunshot, and phoenix burning to ashes.

And he hears the clock bells the tone of the high noon.

Cas struggles, but the trap and sigils render him powerless.

Dean's voice comes through in prayer, calling his name, for the many days followed. Cas hates himself for can't be there when he needs him.

He breaks free when a fire tears down the whole place. The flames catches his clothes on fire, and threatens to burn his vessel. Cas manages to jump out of the window, landing on some bushes. Leaving only scratches on the skin.

The road has a fresh track of horse's hooves. The way that Dean leaves. Leading to a place he doesn't know where.

Cas finds a horse with no owner, and follows the track toward west.
