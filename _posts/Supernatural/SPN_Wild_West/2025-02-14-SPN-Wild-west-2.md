Bobby paces the living room, a few steps in front of the sofa where a bleeding out angel passed out.

"Balls." It might be the hundredth or thousandth time he curses. He doesn't bother counting.

The countdown on the clock is running out fast. Cas doesn't show any sign of waking up.

Bobby frowns deep, throwing looks between the clock and Cas every second.

Cas crashed into the kitchen little more than three hours ago, leaving a bloody sigil on the fridge door, and practically went straight into the coma. No explanation.

"Balls." Bobby curses under his breath again, staring at the unconscious angels.

The timer soon hits zero. The boys would be waiting in the goddamn wild west a hundred fifty years in the past, the only angel in the room is not waking up. Both waiting for him to save the day, what's he gonna do, wrapping a wing that's never there?

"Ok Cas, don't smite me or anything," Bobby approaches the sofa carefully, thinking twice, then shaking Cas's shoulder. First not so much harshly, then a lot more. But still, the eyes are closed, the cut on his abdomen is bleeding some ominous bright light.

Bobby slaps his face -- also lightly first, all things considered, then a lot less so. But nothing works.

Bobby runs out of idea.

"Balls" is not enough for him given the circumstance. He'd need a stronger word.

<br>

There might be a spell or something useful in the books. Bobby jumps back into the familiar realm, diving into the lore and magic, looking for something that may remotely give some hope, of either bringing the boys home by himself or waking up the angel.

He did wrap a bandage on Cas's abdomen, trying vainly to stop the angelic bleeding. Not gonna do anything to the celestial creature in his true form, sure, Bobby figured that, but maybe healing the vessel might just help him recover a little bit faster? With nothing by hand, all he can do is hope.

And pray.

He has to pray for all of them now. But if not to Cas, to whom?

Glancing at the bloody sigil with Cas's fingerprint that is visibly gradually drying out, it can be a big mistake. Bobby downs a glass of whiskey before doing that.

"Well, call me stupid but none of you here stopping me, so here goes nothing." Bobby looks up at the ceiling.

"Whatever angel out there," he says, grumpily, can't decide whether to keep the eyes open or shut, settled with squinting, "uh, hope you're on our side. Could use a little help here."

The sigil on the fridge door brightens up, burning into a bright golden color, similar to the leaking light from inside Cas, then dying out slowly. It might look a little shallower than before, Bobby observes, not knowing what it means.

No angel shows up. Not sure if it's good or bad news.

Bobby turns back to the books for help.

<br>

Bobby doesn't close his eyes in the first night. The letters on the pages start swimming.

Castiel is still not responding to anything. Face pale, body cold.

Bobby examines his wound -- while murmuring "I don't have a goddamn PhD in angelic medics, just so you know" -- the cut is still deep, the leaking light is blinding, but Bobby decides it's not as blinding as yesterday. Not sure if it's hopeful thinking or his eyes are just getting adjusted to angel grace.

He sighs long and deep. "Should have talked them out of this, told you it's a bad idea, but who'd listen?"

The next day passes in the book and regular check with the angel. So is the day after.

Bobby is getting increasingly desperate. "Never thought I'd lose the boys like this, in a time even before they're born."

He slams Castiel's collar, shaking him a lot more violently. "You gotta wake up, Cas." his voice practically pleading. "Dean's waiting for you! Sam's waiting for you!"

Cas lets out a pained groan.

Bobby puts him down. "Cas?"

Castiel wakes up a few more hours later, exhaling sharply. Eyes opening slowly, staring straight into the space in front of him, blank, then onto Bobby's screwed face, confused.

He frowns deep, trying to pull himself up from the sofa but wobbly so much that he crashes back down the minute he puts the weight on the legs.

"There he is." Bobby breathes out, not exactly relieved but at least feels lighter than the past seventy something hours. He lends a hand to help Cas balance. "What happened?"

Castiel gets rid of the bandage, palm covering the wound. The light is still leaking from between his fingers. He tells him, "I was, uh... I was attacked, betrayed by one of our own."

"Should see the other guy, right?" Bobby tries putting a light tone there.

Castiel probably doesn't get the reference, he answers anyway. "Rachel, she was killed. But I was wounded. Need to use some safety, so... thank you."

"You mean that finger painting?" Bobby eyes the sigil that he has stared for so many times over the past few day. It's barely visible now. Only a light bloody stain, smudged.

Cas follows his eyes, frowning deeper. "Is there any other angels coming around this place while I was out?" he glares at Bobby.

Bobby shrugs. "Not that I know of."

Cas looks into him, saying gravely. "Did you... pray to them?"

Bobby tilts his head, having a bad feeling but has to defend himself. "Well, you're out, boys need a ride home, what else was I supposed to do? So yeah, distress call."

Cas looks like he was about to snap, but decides at the last minute to turn it into a sigh. "You might just put both of us in extreme danger, me, especially. Since Raphael might already find where I am, or at least close enough. I could be dead any minute by now if it's not still shielding me."

Bobby steps back half a step, giving Cas some space as he tries to give another attempt to stand up. "Well, I'm sorry. I guess. Was really out of option there."

"How long was I unconscious?" Cas leaves the sofa, walking shakily toward the desk.

"Three days, give or take." Bobby answers, without having to check the time. "Now would really be a good time to bring the boys home. Should have enough fun in the Frontierland by now."

"I can't." Cas drops his head, facing away from Bobby.

"Come again?"

"The fight... it drained me." Cas shifts his feet. Uneasy. "And it's been too long. They're lost to me already."

Bobby scowls at his back, snapping. "Then found them! You can't just leave Sam and Dean in the past like that!"

"I know." Castiel turns back, looking at Bobby in the eyes, solemnly. "So I'll still go, and try my best, but I don't know what's the chance. If I don't make it back..." he breaks the gaze, "please know that I'm truly sorry and I mean it."

With that, and a disturbance of wind flow in the room, Castiel is gone.

"What--" Bobby takes two steps ahead, right next to where the angel was, but it is so clear there is nothing left there anymore.
