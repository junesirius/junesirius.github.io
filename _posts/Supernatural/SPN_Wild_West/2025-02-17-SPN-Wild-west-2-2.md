"This is stupid, even for you." The thundering voice sounds from above him. Cas doesn't need to look up to know who has found him.

The stab pierces through the abdomen of the vessel, but it's even worse for his true form. The outer ring gets a deep cut through, almost reaching the middle ring. The root of one of the right wings is also wounded. He can barely fly straight.

*It's like leaving a blood trail in the open sea,* he thinks distantly. *He's the drowning swimmer, attracting the sharks.*

"Thought I could at least have a head start before you catch up," Cas answers, beating his wings as hard as he can. Pain tears through his wings with each slap. But he has to keep going.

Below them, the time flux is flowing, bright and sparkling. Almost like flying through space, admiring the galaxies. In a way, time is no different from space.

"So you know I'd find you, sooner or later," Raphael amuses. The flow from the archangel's wings disturbs this time dimension like a tornado sweeping through a wild plain. "I didn't know you were the suicidal type."

"Not suicidal." Cas dives lower, avoiding the central turbulence, trying to use the left wings to compensate for the wounds on the right side. He doesn't bother checking if the bleeding grace is getting worse. The bandage Bobby wrapped him with didn't do anything. His essence is running out fast.

He's running out of time too.

*Not suicidal. Desperate.*

It's actually funny. Cas's mind somehow wanders away. If Dean were here, he'd definitely make a remark about how you can even run out of time when you're literally *in* the time dimension, scouting the time flux.

Cas can't think of any joke himself.

*Not suicidal, just trying to find the people too important to lose.* He just needs enough time to find them before Raphael gets a hold of him -- and undoubtfully damns him into the eternality of being killed over and over again.

The time flux has an urgent turn around the nineteenth century, with the Civil War and everything, the history is not so easy to make out. Cas squints, focusing on the reflections in the time flux --

That's when he loses balance suddenly. A harsh tear on the tip of his top left wing makes him gasp in pain, the inner ring shrinks reflexively, like how a human would yell and jump back at an unexpected strike of pain.

Cas curls his left wings for protection, dropping altitude. Raphael's big shadow swoops right on top of him, like an eagle diving for its prey sparrow.

He manages a sharp turn to avoid the following attack. The tip of his lower wings dipping into the time flux, catching a dampness from the early twentieth century.

Cas resets his rings and wings, swirling backward.

"You do know it is pointless to fight or hide from me, don't you?" Raphael mocks, turning around as well, following him two wings' distance away.

"How did you find me?" Cas asks, hoping vainly that talking might distract the archangel for a split heartbeat for a break, while widening all the eyes he has to scan the time flux. It's been a while since he had to fight in the time dimension in his true form, even longer to have to find a soul here, if ever.

But surely familiarity and the profound bond should make it easier? Cas starts getting anxious, finding the time flux looking even more rapid and confusingly dazzling than he remembers. Something disturbing is going on in these western times, but he doesn't know what, and Dean is there, going through the weird time and history on his own, without wings and without protection.

Cas flaps his wings more rapidly, bearing all the tearing sensation ripping through his rings and wings. Not caring that the faster he goes, the faster the grace bleeds and loses, spilling from his true form like dripping blood along the way.

Then, for the second time, the disturbance in the air hits him sharply from the center, he almost falls directly into the time flux below.

The archangel hasn't even unleashed his supernova-level grace, just using the tips of his wings that are as sharp as any metal in the universe that can ever be, almost cutting him in half.

Castiel screams in pain in his true voice. The time dimension echoes his sound. Raphael laughs behind him in satisfaction.

"I can smell your bleeding grace from two galaxies away, Castiel," Raphael tells him, tone satisfying. "Let alone that human you hang out with, gave us a loud and clear coordinate. So give up, Castiel, you can not hide from me in any time or space. I will always find you, and I will always destroy you."

The second cutting swing comes from the other side, Cas hears it coming before it hits him, he ducks sideways. The archangel's feathers are like natural angel blades, scratching his innermost ring, missing the heart of his essence by mere inches.

He might get killed any minute now. Cas thinks bitterly. And then Dean and Sam would be trapped in the western wasteland of the past, forever. They won't even reach the time when the first Impala was ever produced when they die of old age -- *if* they die of old age. They won't ever come back home again.

Cas blinks hard, opening all his wings again, wounded or not, shooting upward. Directly into Raphael from below. The rings around his essence spin fast and urgent, like a rapidly beating heart.

Raphael doesn't expect the change of direction in his moves. He has no time to divert.

Castiel uses his whole existence as a bullet, the momentum as the fuel, hitting Raphael in his most vulnerable ring -- the same part in Cas that is beating and spinning glaringly, the innermost ring around the essence. Raphael is pushed off balance, for a split heartbeat, out of control of where he's heading.

Castiel catches the blink of opportunity when Raphael does not have eyes on him, diving straight into the time flux below.

The time dimension swirls and rotates around him, absorbing him into the point he hits. The speed of rotation makes his rings twist and deform. No wonder every time he pops Dean in and out, the human would complain about motion sickness. This must be the exact dizziness a human would feel if he doesn't have any grace left.

The thought makes his heart thump hard and cold.

*Did he lose all his grace just to reach them? How is he going to take them home now?*

Without any answer to any of the questions, his feet land on solid ground again. Castiel tumbles forward, dropping onto all fours, spitting blood onto the sandy ground in front of him. The view is swimming, the ground floating up and down as if he's being washed away by the tide. He has to focus very hard to not let his cold, shaking limbs give way here and now.

Wind blows, sand rises around him. The vessel coughs, more blood dripping, from everywhere, not just from his mouth.

Cas only gets time to see a wooden sign with neat carving that says "Sunrise, WYO." before the world turns completely black.
