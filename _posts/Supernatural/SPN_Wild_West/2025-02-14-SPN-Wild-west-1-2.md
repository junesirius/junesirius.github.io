Bobby paces the living room, a few steps in front of the sofa where a bleeding-out angel passed out.

"Balls." It might be the hundredth or thousandth time he's cursed. He doesn't bother counting.

The countdown on the clock is running out fast. Cas doesn't show any sign of waking up.

Bobby frowns deeply, throwing looks between the clock and the angel every other second.

Cas crashed into the kitchen a little more than three hours ago, leaving a bloody sigil on the fridge door, and practically went straight into a coma. No explanation.

"Balls." Bobby curses under his breath again, staring at the unconscious angel.

The timer soon hits zero. The boys would be waiting in the goddamn Wild West a hundred fifty years in the past, the only angel in the room is not waking up. Both waiting for him to save the day, what's he gonna do, wrapping a wing that's never there?

"Okay Cas, don't smite me or anything," Bobby approaches the sofa gingerly, thinking twice, then shaking Cas's shoulder. First not quite harshly, then a lot more. But still, the eyes are closed, the cut on his abdomen is bleeding some ominous bright light.

Bobby slaps his face -- also starts easy, all things considered, then a lot less so. But nothing works.

Bobby runs out of ideas.

"Balls" isn't cutting it anymore, given the circumstance. He needs a stronger word.

<br>

There might be a spell or something useful in the books. Bobby jumps back into the familiar realm, diving into the lore and magic, looking for something that may remotely give some hope, of either bringing the boys home himself or waking up the angel.

He had wrapped a bandage around Cas's abdomen, trying vainly to stop the angelic bleeding. Not gonna do anything to the celestial creature in his true form, sure, Bobby figured that, but maybe healing the vessel might just help him recover a little faster? With jack squat by hand, all he can do is hope.

And pray.

He has to pray for all of them now. But if not to Cas, to whom?

Glancing at the bloody sigil with Cas's fingerprint that is visibly gradually drying out, it can be a big mistake. Bobby downs a glass of whiskey before doing that.

"Well, call me stupid but none of you are here to stop me, so here goes nothing." Bobby looks up at the ceiling.

"Whatever angel's out there," he says gruffly, can't decide whether to keep his eyes open or shut, he settles on squinting, "uh, hope you're on our side. Could use a little help here."

The sigil on the fridge door brightens up, burning into a lit-up golden color, as bright as the light leaking from Cas, then dying out slowly. The pattern looks a little shallower than before, muffled, Bobby observes, not sure what it means.

No angel shows up. Not sure if it's good news or bad, either.

Bobby turns back to the books for help.

<br>

Bobby doesn't close his eyes the first night. The letters on the pages start swimming.

Castiel is still not responding to anything. Face pale, body cold.

Bobby examines his wound -- while murmuring "I don't have a goddamn PhD in angel medics, just so you know" -- the cut is deep, the leaking light blinding, but Bobby decides it's not as blinding as yesterday. Could be wishful thinking though, or his eyes are just getting used to angel grace.

He sighs long and deep. "Should have talked them out of this, told you it's a bad idea, but who'd listen?"

The next day passes in the books and regular checks on the angel and alcohol. So does the day after.

Bobby is getting increasingly desperate. "Never thought I'd lose the boys like this, in a time even before they're born."

He slams Castiel's collar, shaking him much more violently. "You gotta wake up, Cas," his voice practically pleading. "The boys are waiting for you! Dean's waiting for you!"

Cas lets out a pained groan.

Bobby loosens the grip, easing him back down. "Cas?"

Exhaling sharply, Castiel wakes up. Eyes opening slowly, staring straight into the space in front of him, blank, then onto Bobby's screwed-up face, confused.

He frowns deep, trying to pull himself up from the sofa but wobbling so much that he crashes back down the second he puts weight on his legs.

"There he is." Bobby breathes out, not exactly relieved but at least lighter than the past seventy-something hours. He lends a hand to help Cas balance. "What happened?"

Castiel tears open the bandage, palm covering the wound. Light and human blood mix together, seeping out from between his fingers. Grimacing, he tells Bobby with a furrowed frown, "I was, uh... I was attacked. Betrayed by one of our own."

"Should see the other guy, right?" Bobby tries putting a lighter tone there.

Castiel probably doesn't get the reference, he answers anyway. "Rachel -- I had to kill her. But I was wounded. Needed somewhere safe, so... thank you."

"You mean that finger painting? What's with the artwork?" Bobby eyes the sigil that he has stared at for so long these past few days that he'd already memorized the thing. It's barely visible now. Barely anything more than a smudged bloodstain.

Cas follows his gaze, his frown deepening. "Is there any other angels coming around this place while I was unconscious?" he glares at Bobby.

Bobby shrugs. "Not that I know of."

Cas looks into him, voice graver. "Did you... pray to them?"

Bobby tilts his head, having a bad feeling yet has to defend himself. "Well, you were out, boys need a ride home, what else was I supposed to do? So yeah, distress call."

Cas looks like he was about to snap, but decides at the last second to turn it into a sigh. His lips thin into a line. "You might've just put both of us in extreme danger -- me especially. Raphael might've already heard it and find where I am, could already be closing in. I could be dead any minute now if it's not still shielding me."

Defeated, Bobby takes half a step back, giving Cas some space as he gives another attempt to stand up. "Well, I'm sorry. I guess. Was really out of options there."

"How long was I unconscious?" Cas leaves the sofa, walking shakily toward the desk.

"Three days, give or take," Bobby answers, without having to check the time. "Now would really be a good time to bring the boys home. Should have enough fun in Frontierland by now."

"I can't." Cas drops his head, facing away from Bobby.

"Come again?"

"The fight... it drained me." Cas shifts his feet, uneasy. "And it's been too long. They're lost to me already."

Bobby scowls at his back, snapping. "Then found them! You can't just leave Sam and Dean in the past like that!"

"I know! You think I don't know that?" Castiel blurts out, sharp and pained. He turns, meeting Bobby's eyes, solemn. Determined. "So I'll still go and try my best, but I don't know what the chances are. If I don't make it back..." he breaks the gaze, "please know that I'm truly sorry and I mean it."

With that, and a disturbance of wind flow in the room, Castiel is gone.

"What does that --" Bobby takes two steps forward, right next to where the angel was, but it is so clear there is nothing left there anymore.
