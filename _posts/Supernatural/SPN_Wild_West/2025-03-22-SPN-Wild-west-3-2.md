Dean doesn't expect to be recognized when he reaches Utah. Words travel faster than his horse, apparently.

But still not fast enough to cross time and history and reach Cas, it seems. He just has to keep doing what he already started, with or without a plan -- the path of a western outlaw.

The gang is playing poker at the saloon when he pushes the door open. One of them looks up first, and the rest stop the game.

"Clint Eastwood," they say, not in the friendliest tone.

Dean tenses, fingers reaching for his pistols automatically.

They laugh loudly and drunkenly, standing up and moving toward him, no guns pointed his way. Dean lowers his hands, squinting, confused.

"Look at this good lad." The one that seems to be their leader stands two steps away in front of him, glancing back at the rest of the group. They make cheerful noises.

Dean stares at him.

"Heard you've got quite some body counts on your trail, Clint, but only those who deserved it. Figured you'd try your luck around here about now." The cowboy holds out a hand. "Butch. We are the Hole-in-the-Wall gang, if you have been around long enough, you'd have heard of us."

Dean huffs a laughter, shaking his hand. "Oh, I've heard," he says admiringly, more enthusiastic than he intends. How could he not? The legendary Hole-in-the-Wall gang, not only has he rewatched the movie more times than he can count, but also knows the inside-out of their whereabouts and everyone's ending. Perks of time travel. But that would be years down the road, he wouldn't worry for them yet. Still early enough in time.

"I take it that must be the Sundance Kid?" Dean nods at a sharp-looking man by the desk, who didn't bother to stand when the others did, a moustache too thick to see the lips.

Butch follows his gaze, nodding, beaming with approval. "So you did hear about us." His tone over glad and polite. It's actually surprising to see one so affable and polite as a gangster, no wonder the gang makes their charming reputation in history. If he sticks with them, maybe his name can be branded together and make out loud like a quick pass? Dean wouldn't complain hanging out with this group if they're truly like the movie shows.

"Come join us, the round's on us." Butch gestures, and Dean sits next to him. The group resumes their poker game.

"Thought you mostly hung around Wyoming?" He can't help wondering out loud. "What brings you to Utah?"

Butch laughs while pouring him a drink. "What can I say, we ran out of banks there."

"Already?" Dean amuses. There gotta be another thirty years before their lights out, will there be any banks left in the states for them to rob? He wonders, but knows that would be a question that spoils the future and more importantly, what he knows and where he comes from, Dean is clever enough to remember to keep his mouth shut.

Butch doesn't notice his pause, just shrugs. "There will be more once we finish with Utah and Arizona and all those barbaric places. We'll come back to Wyoming. They keep building new banks like growing crops to harvest. What a nice way of provoking new fortune, wouldn't you say?"

Dean laughs and nods, drinking from the glass. It's not beer, and it tastes better than Elkins' stock.

"You got a job in this town?" Three drinks later, Dean asks. With poker cards in his hands. Sundance is dealing.

"Right down the road, the new bank has only two guards and closes at sunset," Butch tells him. Dean wonders curiously how come no one in the place hears their loud discussion of a robbery and raises an alarm. But glancing around, judging by how drunk most folks are and the fact that it's still bright afternoon, the answer isn't too difficult to figure out.

"You want to join?" Butch plays his cards, glancing at him. "We could use a man like you."

Dean looks at his cards, pretending he's thinking about what to play next. "Sure," he says, picking two cards and throwing on top of the ones Butch just played.

"Sundance can cover you if things go bad," Butch says in a light tone, no sign of worry or concern.

"I'm relieved," Dean answers with a smile.

They leave the saloon about half an hour before sunset. Not all of them can walk straight, but they don't need everyone for the action anyway.

The robbery goes smoothly.

"The money isn't yours, life is. The company will cover the loss, don't try to be a hero," Butch tells the people in the bank, with a gun in his hand. Dean and Sundance by his side.

The guards don't even try to keep up a fight. Dean locks them inside the safety chamber, takes the case with gold and cash, and passes it to Butch.

They leave the town galloping before the Sheriff is informed or the deputies get a chance to chase. The town is out of sight shortly, the gang cheers with their profits.

"Well, that was easy," Dean smirks.

"That your first robbery?" Butch glances at him.

"You could say that," Dean decides the one with the demons doesn't count.

"You are a natural," Butch compliments.

They keep moving south.

<br>

Dean notices a poster of his own face outside a bank in a town in Arizona during scouting. Next to the ones of Cassidy and Sundance. Headlining the price of a wanted reward. The name under his sketch is "Clint Eastwood," at least that makes him smile a little.

He goes back to Butch and says it might not be a good idea to rob here again, the guards can probably recognize them easily enough.

"You're afraid?" Butch raises an eyebrow. "Afraid of death?"

"No," Dean defends automatically, but his thought does wander briefly, imagining his own dead body lying on the bank floor, bleeding out with a bullet hole to the heart, imagining Cas finding him like that, or Sam. Or maybe none of them does and they never find out what happened to him. He swallows down the lump in his throat hard. "But isn't it better to stay alive?"

Butch considers, then agrees to skip this town.

The next town is the same, the wanted price gets even higher. The bank has more guards than they saw before anywhere else, and there are patrols on the road, carrying rifles.

"That's getting ridiculous," Dean complains. "Where do they find so many people to protect some printed paper, but no one really does a girl a solid justice?"

"Welcome to the Wild West," Butch replies.

"Are we switching gears now?" Dean asks, trying to remember the timeline of events for them in history. He still keeps Sam's warning in mind about not messing with the real important history stuff, and wonders what's the odds Cas might see a wanted poster of him and know where and when he is.

"What do you mean?" Butch doesn't follow.

Dean finds himself in a big moment of realization that this very idea of robbing trains might actually come from him. The bootstrap paradox.

He asks them, "Where does the money in banks come from?"

"The carriages?" one of the members offers.

"And where do the carriages get them from?"

"The train." Butch starts smiling.

"There's a railway line right across Arizona." Dean doesn't need an updated -- outdated, in this sense -- map to know what the atlas looks like. "We just need some dynamite."

They gather the dynamite, so much more than they actually need, and blow the safety case to the sky. The poor clerk from the Union Pacific Flyer murmurs his protest through the whole thing, landing bloody and with a broken arm after the smoke from the blast clears. But at least he's still alive.

Printed cash flies in the sky like falling snowflakes. The gang cheers and grabs the money, stuffing as much as they can grab into their jacket pockets and bags. Dean catches a few bills that fall close to him and examines the patterns and numbers on the paper. Butch watches him from the corner of his eye.

By nightfall, they are out of Arizona. The small saloon in Nevada doesn't know their names or faces. They order drinks and rooms, and accompanies of the fine ladies, many of them tipping over generously with the newfound fortune they just gained, leaving for the second floor way earlier than the usual turn-in hour.

Dean stays by the bar, sitting in a corner seat, soaking in the drink. Some town folks are playing banjos and harps in the empty space around the tables, the music loud and cheerful, just as western as it can be. Some girls sway to the music, then start dancing, some men joining them soon after.

Dean watches the group as if he's just watching an old western movie up close, but he's not really expecting to be inside the scene. He remembers there was one time he was absent-mindedly watching a rerun of *The Outlaw Josey Wales* in the motel when Cas dropped by.

"The classicest of the classic, the western to rule them all," Dean told him.

Cas sat down next to him on the motel bed, watching the screen that was way too small. They should watch it here, like this, surrounded by music and dancing people three hundred and sixty degree immersive, that's how they could get the whole vibe.

But Cas was already attracted. And Dean was pleased he could interest Cas with a western classic, only to realize minutes later that it was the music instead of the plot that had caught Cas's attention.

"It was beautiful," Cas said, in deep contemplation.

Dean glanced at him, seeing the constant frown unfold between the angel's eyebrows. His expression calm and peaceful, watching the television with a look that said his thoughts were already wandering elsewhere. Dean wondered if that was how the real Wild West was, and if Cas had been there. And he decided, he must have, being an angel and watching Earth for longer than any human history.

"What was it like?" He remembered asking him, can't help himself. "The real Wild West? The towns and people's lives two hundred years ago?"

Cas tilted his head ever so slightly, recalling. "Noisy," he told him. "Very vibrant and alive. I remember the music, it was beautiful. And the people were so simple, life was simple back then. But also bloody. A lot of blood and death, like human history always is."

Dean just nodded, his attention back on the television, with a quick glimpse at Cas every now and then. His lips curled up a little bit at that quiet, comfortable moment stretching between them. That was one of the few moments he got to relax when they were not busy handling apocalypses.

He wishes Cas were here with him, watching the dance, listening to the music. He's pretty sure Cas would enjoy it a lot and comment on something like the history of the harp or the name of their dance.

"You are not like any man I've ever know," the voice sounds up right next to him and gives Dean quite a start, he almost pulls his gun reflexively, only to find Butch sitting down on the stool next to him, with a glass of dark-colored liquid in his hand.

Dean relaxes his muscles, leaning back against the seat. "I'm not like any other men," he replies.

"You're not after fortune, but you rob," Butch observes, then adds. "Or woman, but you're certainly thinking of someone. Is there someone waiting for you to get back to, Clint?" His eyes glance briefly at Dean's fingers as if looking for a wedding ring.

"You could say that." Dean takes a casual drag from his glass.

"Then why don't you go back to her?" Butch asks, not in a manner of probing, but genuinely curious like a friend would.

Dean decides there is no point in correcting the pronoun, just to avoid complicating things. "I'm on my way," he says, as much of a fact as he can offer. "We got separated, so now I need to figure out my way home."

"You have a home to go back to." Butch looks surprised. "Most people around here don't, that's why we move all the time."

Dean hums, taking another sip, not really tasting the flavor of the liquid, wondering what home would be like now. Bobby might be anxious to death, pacing around his study, trying all kinds of different spells and rituals; Sam should still be at Samuel's place, not knowing if he'd find a solution or make any progress by now; and Cas... Cas is still MIA and no one's ever seen or heard from him ever since they parted that day. How long has that been? How long would they meet again, if ever? What if Sam was right and Cas is already gone and... Dean takes a large gulp to swallow down the growing panic in his stomach, feeling his throat still too dry.

"You alright?" Butch reads his face.

Dean hates it when people around him seem always able to read his thoughts on his face. "Yeah," he finishes the drink, leaving the glass on the bar and standing up. "Could use some sleep now. See you in the morning, Butch. Have a good night."

Butch nods and wishes him a good night.

Dean lies in the saloon bed for hours, listening to the folk music continuing deep into the night before finally falling quiet. His eyes on the ceiling, wondering if Cas can hear him still. He prays anyway.

<br>

They keep an eye on the newspapers and posters while moving around. It's always good to know what the lawmen know about them. And for Dean, he certainly can use a good reminder of how big a noise in the era that he has made.

The newspapers aren't always accurate -- as they have forever been. But at least the big headlines usually get their names right, some include their sketches similar to the wanted posters, others tell alleged, over-detailed stories of their robberies:

"Bank robbed in Rattlesnake Bend, Nevada" -- with a photo of the empty case where the gold is supposed to be.

"Cowboy killed in Cattle Creek, Kansas: Clint Eastwood's new headcount" -- with paragraph after paragraph from some witnesses saying how legendary he is, but not in a cold-blooded way, only elegant and attractive, and that dead cowboy was a bully in town.

Dean is amused by that one. "We were never even in Kansas!"

And Butch answers with: "That's just how the story travels."

"Silver Gulch, California: Robinhood appears" -- the small secondary title reads: "Mine robbed, Gold for the whole town." A pissed-off mine owner's curses take up most of the report.

"Well, that one we might actually try later," Dean says.

Butch hums. Dean's not sure if it means agreement or the opposite.

They have a debate over whether to go to California or New Mexico next when they reach the far south of Arizona.

They end up turning east.

"Would be good to see those mines," Dean mumbles.

"That's just rumors and daydreams," Butch replies.

<br>

The wanted posters with their faces have already reached New Mexico ahead of them. Dean has grown a beard ever since he saw the first poster in Utah, but the features are probably still recognizable.

They lay low and only sit in the corner seats of the inn.

Dean makes sure his cowboy hat is low enough as he drinks his beer and glances around, staying in the shade. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid sit at the next table, the rest of the gang scattered around the town.

The folks sitting at the table next to his chat loudly. He hears the name "Clint Eastwood" come up in their talks, so he can't help listening in with all the attention.

"You heard about the new rising star of a cowboy?" one of the folks says. "Name's Clint Eastwood."

"How big of a name is he?" Another asks. "Louder than Jeremiah Johnson?"

Laughter fills that table. "Bear fighting isn't news anymore, Eastwood is. Rumor says he runs with Hall-in-the-Wall gangs, shooting quicker than the Sundance kid. But he doesn't shoot unless the guy has it coming. He plays poker, robs banks, puts on a good old gun duel and never loses. Best of all, not like other gangs, he doesn't take the gold and cash for himself, he gives it to people in need. Poor people, folks like you and me."

"A savior and a saint," someone mocks with a laugh. "Exactly what we need nowadays."

"Robin Hood, more like," they say.

"But it doesn't matter how much folks love him, the companies and states sure as hell hate him. I heard Union Pacific Flyer already gathered a posse after the gang. Eastwood, Cassidy, and Sundance are all on their kill-at-sight list. They must've decided can't afford to have more trains robbed like that."

Dean finishes the rest of his drink in one pull and leaves the place quickly.

The rumor is certainly not just idle chatter. Under the night sky, hundreds of miles away on the barren, open land to their west, there are a dozen lights as small as fireflies in a summer night, moving up and down, in sync with the pace of horses running. The night covers the figures, but the hunter's instinct already kicks in, he moves toward his horse.

Butch and Sundance are right behind him when he leaves the place.

"Whatever they're selling, I ain't buying," Butch says, seeing the same obscured figures on their tail on the horizon.

They dash out of the town, then out of the state, heading north.
