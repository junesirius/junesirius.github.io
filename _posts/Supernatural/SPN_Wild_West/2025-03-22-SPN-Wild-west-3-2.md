---

Dean doesn't expect to be recognized when he reaches Utah. Words travel faster than his horse, apparently.

But still not fast enough to cross the time and history and let Cas hear, it seems. He just has to keep doing what he already started, with or without a plan -- the path of a western outlaw.

The gang was playing poker at the saloon when he pushes the door open. One of them looks up first, and the rest stops the game.

"Clint Eastwood." They say, not in the most friendly tone.

Dean tenses, fingers reaching toward the pistols automatically.

They laugh loudly and drunkenly, standing up and moving to him, no one pointing guns at him. Dean lowers his hands, squinting, confused.

"Look at this good lad." The one that looks like their leader stand two steps away in front of him, glancing back at the rest of the group. They make a cheerful noise.

Dean stares at him.

"Heard you have quite some body counts on your trail, Clint, but only those who deserved it. Figured you'd try your luck around here about now." The cowboy holds out a hand. "Butch. We are the Hole-in-the-Wall, if you have been around long enough you'd hear us."

Dean huffs a laughter, shaking his hand. "Oh I've heard." He says admiringly, more enthusiastic than he intends. How can he not? The legendary Hole-in-the-Wall gang, not only does he rewatch the movie more times than he can count, but also knows the inside-out of their whereabouts and everyone's ending. Perk of time travel. But that would be years down the road, he wouldn't worry for them yet. Still early enough in time.

"I take it that must be the Sundance Kid?" Dean nods at a sharp-looking man around the desk, who didn't bother to stand up when the others did, a moustache too thick to see the lips.

Butch follows his eyes, nodding and beaming. "So you did hear about us." His tone over glad and polite. It's actually surprising to see one so affable and polite as a gangster, no wonder the gang makes their charming name in the history. If he sticks with them, maybe his name can be branded together and makes out loud like a quick pass? Dean wouldn't complain hanging out with this group if they're truly what the movie shows.

"Come join us, the round on us." Butch gestures, and Dean sits next to him. The group resumes their poker games.

"Thought you mostly hang around Wyoming?" He can't help wondering out loud. "What makes you move to Utah?"

Butch laughs while pouring him a glass. "What can I say, we run out of banks there."

"Already?" Dean amuses. There gotta be another thirty years before their lights out, would there be any bank left in the states for them to rob? He wonders, but knowing that would be a question that spoils the future and more importantly, what he knows and where he comes from, Dean is clever enough to remember to keep his mouth shut.

Butch doesn't notice his pause, just shrugs. "There will be more once we finish with Utah and Arizona and all those barbaric places. We'll come back to Wyoming again. They keep building new banks like growing harvests to reap. What a nice way of provoking new fortune, wouldn't you say?"

Dean laughs and nods, drinking the alcohol in the glass. It's not beer, and it tastes better than Elkins' stock.

"You have job in this town?" Three drinks later, Dean asks. With poker cards in his hands, Sundance is dealing.

"Right down the road, the new bank has only two guards and closes at sunset." Butch tells him. Dean wonders curiously how come no one in the place hears their loud discussion of a robbery and not raise an alarm. But glancing around, judging by how drunk most forks are and it's still in the bright afternoon, the answer isn't too difficult to realize.

"You want to join?" Butch plays his cards, glancing at him. "We can use a man like you."

Dean looks at his cards, pretending he's thinking about what to play next. "Sure." He says, picking two cards and throwing on top of the ones Butch just played.

"Sundance can cover you if things go bad." Butch says in a light tone, no sign of worry or concern.

"I'm relieved." Dean answers with a smile.

They leave the saloon about half an hour before the sunset. Not all of them can walk straight, but they don't need everyone in the action anyway.

The robbery goes smoothly.

"The money isn't yours, life is. The company will pay the loss, don't try to be a hero." Butch tells the people in the bank, with a gun in his hand. Dean and Sundance by his side.

The guards don't even try to keep up a fight. Dean lock them inside the safety chamber and take the case with gold and cash out, passing to Butch.

They leave the town in galloping before the Sheriff is informed or the deputies get a chance of chasing. The town is out of view shortly, the gang cheers with the profit.

"Well, that was easy." Dean smirks.

"That's your first robbery?" Butch glances at him.

"You can say that." Dean decides the one with the demons doesn't count.

"You are a natural." Butch compliments.

They keep moving south.

<br>

Dean notices a poster of his own face outside the bank in a town in Arizona during scouting. Next to the ones of Cassidy and Sundance. Headlining the price of wanted. The name under his sketch is "Clint Eastwood", at least that makes he smile a little.

He goes back to Butch and says it might not be a good idea to rob here again, the guards can probably recognize them easily enough.

"You're afraid?" Butch raises an eyebrow. "Afraid of death?"

"No." Dean defends automatically, but his thought does wander briefly imagining his own dead body lying on the bank floor, bleeding out with a gun hole to the heart, imagining Cas finds him like that, or Sam. Or no one does and they never find out what happened to him. He swallows down the lump in the throat. "But isn't it better to stay alive?"

Butch considers, agrees to skip this town.

The next town is the same, the wanted price gets even higher. The bank has more guards than they saw before, and there are patrols on the road, carrying rifles.

"That's getting ridiculous." Dean complains. "Where do they find so many people protecting some printed paper, but no one really do a girl a solid justice?"

"Welcome to the Wild West." Butch says.

"Are we switching gears now?" Dean asks. Trying to remember the timeline of events for them in the history. He still keeps in mind Sam's warning about not to mess up with the real important history stuff, and wonders what's the odds Cas can see a wanted poster of him and knows where and when he is.

"What do you mean?" Butch doesn't follow.

Dean finds himself have the big moment of realization that this very idea of robbing trains might actually comes from him. He tells them, "Where do money in banks come from?"

"The carriages?" One of the members offer.

"And where do the carriages get them from?"

"The train." Butch starts smiling.

"There is a railway line right across Arizona." Dean doesn't need an updated -- outdated, in this sense -- map to know what's the atlas is like. "We just need some dynamite."

They gather the dynamite, too much more than what they actually need, and blow the safety case to the sky. The poor clerk from the Union Pacific Flyer murmurs his protest through the whole thing, landed bloody and a broken arm after the smoke from the blast is cleared. But at least he's still alive.

Printed cash flies in the sky like falling snow flakes. The gang cheers and robs the money, stuffing as much as they can grab inside their jacket pockets and bags. Dean catches a few that fall close to him and regards the patterns and numbers on the paper. Butch watches him from the periphery of his eyes.

By night, they are out of Arizona. The small saloon in Nevada doesn't know their names or faces. They order for drinks and rooms, and accompany of the fine ladies, many of them tipping over generously with the new fortune they just gained, leaving for the second floor way earlier than the usual turn-in hour.

Dean stays by the bar, sitting in a corner seat, soaking in the drink. Some town folks are playing banjo and harps in the empty space around the tables, the music loud and cheerful, just as western as it can be. Some girls sways to the music, then dancing, some men join them soon after.

Dean watches the group as if he's just watching an old western movie up close, but he's not really expecting to be inside the scene. He remembers there was one time he was absent-mindedly watching a rerun of *The Outlaw Josey Wales* in the motel when Cas dropped by.

"The classicest of the classic, the western to rule them all." He told him.

Cas sit down next to him on the motel bed, watching the screen that was way too small. They should watch it here, like this, surrounded by music and dancing people three hundred and sixty degree immersive, that's how they could get the whole vibe.

But Cas was already attracted. And Dean was pleased he could interest Cas with a western classic, only to realize minutes later that it's the music instead of the plot that caught Cas's attention.

"It was beautiful." Cas said, in deep contemplation.

Dean glanced at him, seeing the constant frown unfold in between the angel's eyebrows. His expression calm and peaceful, watching the television with a look that says his thoughts were already wandering elsewhere. Dean wondered if it was how the real wild west was, and if Cas had been there. And he decided, he must have, being an angel and watching the earth for longer than any human history.

"What was it like?" He remembered asking him, can't help himself. "The real wild west? The towns and people's lives two hundred years ago?"

Cas tilted his head ever so slightly, recalling, "Noisy," he told him. "Very vibrant and alive. I remember the music, they were beautiful. And the people were so simple, the life was simple back then. But also bloody. A lot of blood and deaths, like the human history all the time."

He just nodded, attention back to the television, with a quick glimpse at Cas once in a while. His lips curled up a little bit at that quiet, comfortable moment stretching between them. That was one of the few moments he got to relax when they were busy handling the apocalypses.

He wishes Cas is here with him, watching the dance, listening to the music. He's pretty sure Cas would enjoy it a lot and comment with something like the history of the harp or the name of their dance.

"You are not like any man I ever know." The voice sounds up right next to him and gives Dean quite a start he almost pulls his gun in reflexive, only to find Butch sits down on the stool next to him, with a glass of dark color liquid in his hand.

Dean relaxes his muscles, leaning back to the back of the seat. "I'm not like any other men." He replies.

"You're not after fortune but you rob." Butch observes, then adds. "Or woman, but you're certainly thinking of someone. Is there someone waiting for you to get back to, Clint?" His eyes glance temporarily on Dean's fingers where the rings are.

"You can say that." Dean takes a drag from his glass.

"Then why don't you go back to her?" Butch asks, not in a manner of probing privacy, but genuine wondering like a friend would do.

Dean decides there is no point of correcting the pronoun, just to not complicate things. "I'm on my way." He says, as much of a fact as he can offer. "We get separated, so now I need to figure out my way to home."

"You have a home to go back to." Butch looks surprised. "Most people around here don't, that's why we move all the time."

Dean hums, taking another sip, not really tasting the flavor of the liquid, wondering how the home would be like now. Bobby might be anxious to death, wandering around his study, trying all kinds of different spells and rituals; Sam should still in Samuel's place, don't know if he'd find a solution or anything closer by now; and Cas... Cas is still MIA and no one ever seen or heard of him ever since they departed that day. How long had that been? How long would they meet again if ever? What if Sam was right and Cas is already gone and... Dean takes a large gulp to wash down the growing panic in his stomach, feeling the throat still too dry.

"You alright?" Butch reads his face.

Dean hates it when people around him seem always can read his thoughts on his face. "Yeah," he finishes the drink, leaving the glass on the bar and standing up. "Can use some sleep now, see you in the morning. Have a good night."

Butch nods, and wishes him a good night.

Dean lies in the saloon bed for hours, listening to the folk music continuing deep into the night, then falling quiet. His eyes on the ceiling, wondering if Cas can hear him still. He prays anyway.

<br>

They keep an eye on the newspaper and posters while moving around. It's always good to know what the lawmen know about them. And for Dean, he certainly can use a good reminder of how big of a noise in the era that he has made.

The newspapers aren't always accurate -- as they have forever been. But at least the big titles usually get their names right, some included their sketches similar to the wanted posters, others tell an over-detailed story of their robbery:

"Bank robbed in Rattlesnake Bend, Nevada" -- with a photo of empty case where the gold is supposed to be.

"Cowboy killed in Cattle Creek, Kansas, Clint Eastwood's new headcount" -- with paragraphs after paragraphs of some witness saying how legendary he is, but not in the coldblooded way, only elegant and attractive, and that dead cowboy was a bully in the town.

Dean is amused at that one. "We were never even in Kansas!"

And Butch answers with: "That's just how the story travels."

"Silver Gulch, California: Robinhood appears" -- the small secondary title reads: "Mine robbed, Gold for the whole town". A pissed off mine owner's curses take over most of the report.

"Well, that one we might can actually try." Dean says.

Butch hums. Dean's not sure if it means agreement or the opposite.

They have a debate over whether to go to California or New Mexico next when they reach the far south of Arizona.

They end up turning east.

"Would be good to see those mines." Dean mumbles.

"That's just rumors and daydreams." Butch answers.

<br>

The wanted posters with their faces already reach New Mexico ahead of them. Dean has grown beards ever since he saw the first poster in Utah, but the features are probably still recognizable.

They lay low and only sit in the corner seats of the inn.

Dean makes sure his cowboy hat is low enough when he drinks the beer and glances around, staying in the shade. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid sit in the next table, the rest of the gangs scattered around in the town.

The folks sitting by the table next to his chat loudly. He hears the name "Clint Eastwood" occurs in their talks, so he can't help listening in with all the attention.

"You heard about the new rising star of a cowboy?" One of the folks say, "Name Clint Eastwood."

"How big of a name is he?" Another asks, "Louder than Jeremiah Johnson?"

There are laughter in that table. "Bear fighting isn't news anymore, Eastwood is. Rumor says he moves with Hall-in-the-Wall gangs, shooting quicker than the Sundance Kid. But he doesn't shoot unless the guy has it coming. He plays poker, robs banks, puts on a good old gun duel and never loses. Best of all, not like other gangs, he doesn't take the gold and cash for himself, he gives them to people in need. Poor people, folks like you and me."

"A savior and a saint." Someone mocks in laughter. "Exactly what we need nowadays."

"Robin Hood, more like." They say.

"But it doesn't matter how much folks love him, the companies and states sure as hell hate him. I heard Union Pacific Flyer already gathered a posse after the gang, Eastwood, Cassidy and Sundance are all on their kill-at-sight list. They must decide can't afford to have more trains robbed like that."

Dean finishes the rest of his drink in one pull and leaves the place quickly enough.

The rumor is surely not an ungrounded chatter. Under the night sky, hundreds of miles away on the barren, open land to their west, there are a dozen lights as small as fireflies in the summer night moving up and down, in the same pace of horses' running. The night covers the figures, but the hunter's instinct already kicks in, he moves toward his horse.

Butch and Sundance are right after him when he leaves the place.

"Whatever they're selling, I ain't buying." Butch says.

They dash out of the town, then out of the state, heading north.
