Cas wakes up with a moan, feeling his fingers and toes too far away, his head as heavy as that time he found a liquor store and drank the whole place dry.

He opens his eyes, seeing the white ceiling of the room he's in. A soft blanket covers his body. He tries to move his hand to lower it, only to find thick bandages wrapped over his whole back and front, restricting his movement.

He frowns at the bandages that have hints of blood showing from underneath, trying to remember why his whole body hurts like he has been chopped on a cutting board and why he can't heal himself properly.

A middle-aged madam enters the room. "Wouldn't move if I were you," she says, putting down a plate of food that smells good and greasy.

"Where am I?" Cas frowns.

"Slick Jim's Saloon," the woman answers, her back facing him as she fumbles with something. "Deputy found you unconscious just outside town and brought you in. Thought you'd be dead with all those wounds and blood, but look at you, still breathing. What happened?"

"I was... in a fight." The memory of the time dimension surfaces. The wingspan of Raphael that covered half the space, casting glooming shadows over him, still gives his thoughts a shudder of uneasiness. It must have been when he fell into the time flux and got carried here.

"You got an enemy on your tail?" the woman brings a wet towel over to his bedside. Cas gives her an tight appreciated grin.

"He won't follow me here," Cas tells her. Which is true, more or less, until he uses his grace and Raphael finds the traces and catches up again, eventually. Cas wonders how much time he can have before that happens, and more importantly, if he can find Dean and Sam first. The thought of them floating lost in history makes him grimace, distracted from the physical wounds for a brief moment.

The woman must have mistaken his grimace for pain, leaning over to lower the blanket and check the bandages. "You got a name?"

Cas thinks for a second. "Clarence," he tells her. "Clarence Novak."

"I'm Alice," she says, starting to unwrap the bandages to reveal the wounds on his body. "Helping in the saloon, sometimes patching people up when they need it. Sometimes people, other times just bodies."

Cas watches her hands, old and weathered. "You must have seen many people that needed patching up."

"More than I can count," she says plainly.

The layers of bandages come off, the pieces closest to his skin are soaked in blood. Now he can examine himself. There is a long horizontal cut across his chest, deep and nasty, right over where the heart is. A deep stab wound in the shape of an angel blade on his lower right abdomen, the one from Rachel, which feels like a long time ago and is still bleeding fresh. Alice guides him to turn onto his side, using a wet cloth to clean the wound on his back. And from where the cloth touches, one long vertical cut stretches down his spine, from little below the hairline to just above the tailbone. There are several other smaller cuts across his shoulder blades.

"That enemy of yours pretty much cut you in half," Alice comments.

"I believe that was his intent, yes," Cas agrees in a murmur.

She helps clean up all the wounds and the fresh new blood seeping through the stitches, then rises to fetch more bandages.

"I don't think I'd need those," Cas turns down the offer when he sees what she's about to do.

"And let yourself bleed to death? I don't think so." Alice's hands are strong against his own feeble fingers. The lack of strength in this body that he thought he was getting familiar with after inhabiting it for almost four years now surprises him. Cas falls silent and lets her do the job.

He closes his eyes, reaching inside, trying to scratch and find how much grace he still has left. The effort is exhausting and the result frustrating. The only things he can find inside are twisted guts and bones bleeding as much as the visible cuts on the skin. That explains the taste of metal in his throat.

He has to gesture for a pot and spits out the liquid flooding up from inside. The spit turns out bloody, leaving a bad taste on his tongue.

Alice offers water for a rinse, and looks at him like looking at a dying deer shot by a hunter's shotgun. "I'll be back with something to eat, if you feel like it."

The first reaction crossing his mind is to say thank you but he has no need for food, the second one realizes his empty stomach does make his body uncomfortable. Cas gives her a small smile and says, "Thank you, that would be nice."

And he is left alone in the room again.

The window of the place has a slit of opening, the smell of alcohol and frying stew passes through from the saloon downstairs. There are sounds of horses clopping past outside, the smell of fresh leather and cheap perfume reaching up. There must be some new houses freshly constructed, as Cas can still smell the lingering scent of sawdust from raw pine and oak.

Cas closes his eyes, breathing deep and exhaling long, feeling his lungs expand and contract in the most human way. It worries him, reminding him too much of a memory from back when Lucifer was walking the earth and Dean was practically the only one standing in his way of starting the Apocalypse, when it was two minutes to midnight but he couldn't help him anything more than distracting Michael to buy him five minutes that he needed. He chews on the feeling of being weak, being powerless, unable to protect the human in his charge, and he tastes nothing but bitterness.

Cas thinks about Stull Cemetery a lot, then Battle Creek, Michigan, the house with the woman and the boy where Dean was humming a tune while mowing the lawn. He should never have left that life, then he would never be lost and trapped in the Wild West in the past. Cas breathes out heavily, thinking, with too much clarity: *This is all his fault.* And he has to fix it, right all the wrongs, whatever the cost.

Alice comes back with food on a plate. Cas thanks her for it.

Strength comes back to him as time passes. Cas manages to get out of bed after about ten days, which is also about the time when Jim Elkins, owner of the saloon and bartender, starts asking when he's ready to pay for the room.

The cuts are still deep, the muscles around the wounds contract uncomfortably at each shift of movement, the pain from the injuries is numbed but not gone. Cas puts on an old shirt and pants that Alice found for him and steps downstairs.

The bartender is busy chatting with some folks by the bar. They laugh at some joke or recent news.

Cas decides to wait by the base of the staircase until they move away toward a clean, vacant table in the center of the room.

"There he is, the mysterious man who survived," Elkins regards him. "You look good."

"I look awful," Cas replies unhappily and honestly.

"That's true, I suppose." Elkins' mouth twitches in a small laugh, hands reaching for a used glass to rinse and wipe with a white washcloth. "Meant to visit upstairs but Alice said you were mostly resting. Figured not to disturb a patient."

"By *patient*, you mean *a dying man*," Cas points out, not minding the notion. "I appreciate the help and the place. I needed time to rest and heal, but now I must move on."

"Where are you heading?" Elkins looks at him, eyes sharp like an eagle, short stubble covering his jaw in a clever shape. A young man like him might have a good enough memory to recall if Dean and Sam have been here.

"Have you happened to remember two young men visiting here? One good-looking, about my height, the other tall like a giant, long hair?" Cas gestures with his hands around his head, trying to show how their hair looks by wiggling fingers in the places.

"Not that I can remember." Elkins shrugs, putting the cleaned glass onto the shelf. "Sounds like someone who'd leave an impression if they did."

Cas's eyes follow his movements, thinking. *Maybe they just didn't visit the saloon, which is normal. He'll just have to find them elsewhere.*

Cas is just about to leave for his room, when two people enter the place and the bartender greets them, "Morning, Sheriff. Deputy."

The Sheriff eases onto a stool, putting down the newspaper in his hand. "Can't believe old John actually made it and settled in Texas," he says to the other men, casual chatting, "Never thought he'd name the place *Dallas*."

Cas turns around sharply, moving so fast he can feel some stitches bursting open underneath the bandage. "What did you say?"

The Sheriff looks at him. "What? Dallas?"

Cas doesn't answer, he stills deadly when his eyes land on the paper.

He asks, then, after a long moment, if there is any ranch nearby he can help out at.
