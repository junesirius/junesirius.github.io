Cas wakes up in a moan, feeling his fingers and toes too far away, his head as heavy as that time he found a liquor store and drank the whole place.

He opens the eyes, seeing white ceiling of the room he's in. Soft blanket covers his body. He tries to move his hand to lower it, only to find thick bandages wrapping over his whole back and front, restricting the move.

He frowns at the bandage that has hints of blood showing from underneath, trying to remember why his whole body hurts like he has been chopped on a cutting board and he can't heal himself properly.

A middle-aged madam enters his room. "Wouldn't move if I were you." She tells, putting down a plate of food that smells good and greasy.

"Where am I?" Cas frowns.

"Slick Jim's Saloon." The woman answers, her back facing him when she fumbles with something. "Deputy found you unconscious just outside the town and brought you him. Thought you'd be dead with all the wounds and blood, but look at you, still breathing. What happened?"

"I was... in a fight." The memory of the time dimension surfaces. The wingspan of Raphael that covered half the space, casting glooming shadows over him still gives his thought shudder and uneasiness. It must be when he fell into the time flux and got carried here.

"You got an enemy on your tail?" The woman brings a wet towel when she walks over to his bedside. Cas gives her an appreciated tight grin.

"He won't follow me here." Cas tells her. Which is the truth, more or less, until he uses his grace and Raphael finds the traces and catches up to him again, eventually. Cas wonders how much time he can have before that, and more importantly, if he can find Dean and Sam before that. The thought of them floating lost in the history makes him grimace, distracted from the physical wounds for a brief moment.

The woman must has mistaken his grimace for pain, leaning over to lower the blanket to check on the bandage. "You got a name?"

Cas thinks for a second, "Clarence." He says, "Clarence Novak."

"I'm Alice," She says, starts unwrapping the bandage to reveal the wounds on his body. "Helping in the saloon, sometimes patch people up when they need to. Sometimes people, other times just bodies."

Cas watches her hands, old and weathered. "You must have seen many people that need patch up."

"More than I can count." She says plainly.

The layers of the bandages are unwrapped, the pieces that are closest to his skin are soaked in blood. Now he can examine himself. There is a long horizontal cut over his chest, deep and nasty, right over where the heart is. A deep stab wound the shape of angel blade on his right lower abdomen, the one from Rachel that feels like long time ago and still bleeding fresh. Alice guides him turn to his side, using a wet cloth to clean the wound on his back. And from where the cloth touches, one of the long vertical cuts stretches across the spine, from little under the hairline to little above the tailbone. There are a few other shorter cuts on the shoulder blades.

"That enemy of yours pretty much cut you in half." Alice comments.

"I believe that is his intent, yes." Cas agrees in murmur.

She helps clean up all the wounds and the new blood seeping through the stitches, and rises up to fetch more bandage.

"I don't think I'd need those." Cas turns down the offer when he sees what she's about to do.

"And let yourself bleed to death? I don't think so." Alice's hands are strong against his own feeble fingers. The lack of strength in this body that he thought he's getting familiar with after inhabiting for almost four years now surprises him. Cas falls silent and lets her do the job.

He closes his eyes, reaching inside, trying to scratch and find how much grace he still has left. The effort is tiring and the result is frustrating. The only things he can find inside are the twisted guts and bones that bleed as much as the visible cuts on the skin. That explains the taste of metal in his throat.

He has to gesture for a pot and spits out the liquid flooding up from inside. The spit turns out bloody, leaving a bad taste on the tongue.

Alice offers water for a rinse, and looks at him like looking at a dying deer shot by a hunter's shotgun. "I'll be back with something to eat, if you feel like."

The first reaction crosses his mind is to say thank you but he has no need for food, the second one realizes the empty stomach does make his body uncomfortable. Cas gives her a smile and says, "Thank you, that would be nice."

And he is left alone in the room again.

The window of the place has a slit of opening, the smell of alcohol and frying stew passes through from the saloon downstairs. There are sounds of horses passing by, smell of fresh leather and cheap perfume reaches up. There must be some new houses freshly constructed, as Cas can still smell the lingering air of sawdust from raw pine and oak.

Cas closes his eyes, breathing deep in and exhaling out long, feeling the lung expanding and contracting in the most human way. It worries him, reminding him too much of a memory back when Lucifer was walking the earth and Dean was practically the only one standing on his way of starting the Apocalypse, when it was two minutes to the midnight but he couldn't help him anything more than distracting Michael to earn the five minutes he needed. He chews the feeling of being weak, being powerless, unable to protect the human in his charge, and he tastes nothing but bitterness.

Cas thinks about the Stull Cemetery a lot, then Battle Creek, Michigan, the house with a woman and a boy where Dean was humming a tune while mowing the lawn. He should never leave that life, then he would never be lost and trapped in the wild west in the past. Cas breathes out heavily, thinking, with too much of a clarity: *This is all his fault.* And he has to fix it, right all the wrongs, whatever the cost.

Alice comes back with food on a plate. Cas thanks her for it.

<br>

Strength comes back to him as time goes. Cas manages to get out of the bed after about ten days, which is also time when Jim Elkins, owner of the saloon and bartender, starts asking when he's ready to pay for the room.

The cuts are still deep, the muscles around the wood contract uncomfortably at each shift of move, the pain from the wounds are numbed but not gone. Cas puts on an old shirt and pants that Alice found for him and steps downstairs.

The bartender is busy chatting with some folks by the bar. They laugh at some joke or recent news.

Cas decides to wait by the base of the staircase until they move away toward a clean, vacant table in the center of the room.

"There he is, the mysterious man who survived." Elkins regards him. "You look good."

"I look awful." Cas replies unhappily and honestly.

"That's true, I suppose." Elkins' mouth twitches in a small laughter, hands reaching for a used glass to rinse and wash with a white wash cloth. "Meant to visit upstairs but Alice said you were mostly resting. Figured not to disturb a patient."

"By *patient*, you mean *a dying man*." Cas points out, not minding the notion. "I appreciate the help and the place. I needed time to rest and heal, but now I must move on."

"Where are you heading?" Elkins looks at him, eyes sharp like an eagle, short stubbles covering the jaw in a clever shape. A young man like him might have a good enough memory to recall if Dean and Sam have been here.

"Have you happened to remember two brothers visiting here? One good-looking, about my height, the other tall like a giant, long hairs?" Cas gestures his hands around the hair, trying to show how their hair look like by putting fingers in the places.

"Not that I can remember." Elkins shrugs, putting the cleaned glass onto the shelf. "Sounds like someone who'd leave an impression if they do."

Cas's eyes follow his move, thinking. *Maybe they just didn't visit the saloon, which is normal. He'll just have to find them elsewhere.*

Cas is just about to leave for his room, when two people enter the place and the bartender greets them, "Morning, Sheriff. Deputy."

The Sheriff eases onto a stool, putting down the newspaper in his hand. "Can't believe old John actually made it and settled in Texas." He says to the other men, casual chatting, "Never thought he'd name the place *Dallas*."

Cas turns around sharply, moving so fast he can feel some stitches bursting open underneath the bandage. "What did you say?"

The Sheriff looks at him, "What? Dallas?"

Cas doesn't answer, he stills deadly when his eyes land on the paper.

He asks, then, after a long moment, if there is any ranch nearby he can help out.
