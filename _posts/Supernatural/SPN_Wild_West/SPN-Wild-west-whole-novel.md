Summary:

The plan was simple -- get the phoenix's ashes and get out. But when do things ever go easy for them? High noon comes and goes, and Dean finds himself stranded in the Wild West with no way home -- and no sign of Cas.

Castiel fights hard. Time is fluid and never easy to navigate, especially with his grace bleeding out and an archangel on his tail. The sign of Sunrise, Wyoming is finally in sight, but Dean is not here.

The past is vast, the clock is slow -- they're taking the long way home.

Preview Snippet:

"So, you boys finally decided to move on?" Elkins eyes their looks.

Dean has a red bandana wrapped around his mouth, Sam a black one. They've changed into new shirts and pants -- new for them, old for the clothes -- dirt and stains making them look exactly like the rest of the folks in the place.

The look of a pilgrim, Dean realizes.

He doesn't nod or shake. Just strides straight into the room, heading directly for the bartender they've grown familiar with over the past few days. Dean lets out a breath, tasting a tad of bitterness lingering on the tip of his tongue.

Drawing the pistol from the holster at his waist in a smooth swing, he fires three shots into the ceiling. Some girls scream behind him, he knows Sam must also have his gun drawn, aimed somewhere.

Elkins looks at him, reaching for something underneath the bar stand. Supposedly a shotgun.

"I wouldn't suggest that." Dean shifts his aim toward him. The bartender stops moving, hands slowly rising.

"What's this about?" The old man is still surprisingly calm, not even showing much curiosity.

Just how many gangsters has he run into before? Dean finds himself wondering.

"What every outlaw around here wants," he says, aiming for a deep, grave voice. "You got any hidden treasure around here? Gold would do too."

"At least leave me a name to pass your story along?" Elkins reaches for a side drawer. The gold he offers includes some of the very pieces they paid for their meals over the past few days. Dean has to push down the unease.

"Eastwood. Clint Eastwood. Best gunner in the western world," Dean tells him.

### Loophole fix

If Cas is already in Sunrise Wyoming on 1861.3.5, then why he isn't there when Dean prays for him?

(time travel loophole -> learn from HP3 to fix)

Cas POV: Cas backtracks to 20y ago, lives and waits, then 1861.3.5 comes, Cas arrives in saloon earlier than Dean, witnesses Sheriff burned by the phoenix Elias Finch, hiding to prevent paradox, jump attacked & trapped by demons (the one possess Elkins), so can't get to Dean until the day he burns the place down, Cas free but Dean already rides away, Cas try chase him around but can't catch up, find Dean become wanted, join posse to follow him (also persuade people don't shoot him), Dean runaway from posse, until Dean confronted by 1861!Cas, Cas catch up, fight/blast the old self away, use power to heal Dean (wounded by 1861!Cas), low energy again; can't carry both, fly Sam back first, spit blood when fly back to Dean, collapsed, the two stay in ranch waiting for Cas recover (a bit domestic life), 1y later Cas fly them back to the same day

Dean POV: Cas doesn't come after they pray, start messing around making noise, attacked by demon possessed Elkins, burn place down, leave Sunrise Wyoming; help saloon lady from unjust verdict (bounty hunter, "Unforgiven"), rob bank & train ("Butch Sundance"), chased by railway company posse, start running, so never meet Cas; cornered by posse one night, desperately pray to Castiel, 1861!Cas comes, align with Cas POV afterwards

Sam POV: follow Dean around, Cas fly him back first, Dean&Cas follow immediately, thought it's the same moment, but actually time passed for them a lot longer

(the time they're apart -> fast-forward quickly, a quick sketch, only mention what happened in a series of montage (newspaper clips), tell each other once they met again)

## Main

### Chap.1-1 (Dean stuck in Sunrise)(Sunrise, 1861, Dean+Sam)

> **Outline:** Dean&Sam gets phoenix's ash by noon, bell rings, but Cas doesn't come, they can't get back. Some more time passes, they realize something must have happened to Cas and now they get stuck in the Frontierland and have to figure out what to do. They start living like the locals, blend in as cowboys, get used to it, Dean is the town sheriff.

Eyes unblinking, gun raised, not for a split second Dean thinks he might be too slow. Then the gunshot sound echoes, the phoenix burns with bright golden light and turns into a pile of ashes.

He still gets this. Dean beams to himself.

The clock bells the tone of high noon. Sound shaking him out of the mist of contentment.

"Dean! The ashes!" Sam yells behind him, following by several steps.

Dean dashes to the ashes, glass bottle ready in head, tip opened. The ashes fill into the bottle before the minute ends.

He lets out a breathe, regarding the glassful of ashes, shaking the bottle slightly, closes the lid. Right on time. Mission complete.

The minute passes. No stir in the air.

Dean glances back at Sam, both frowning.

The hands on the wall clock are ticking.

"Where's Cas?" Sam voices the question in his mind, hesitant, uneasy.

Dean gives him a tight smile, checking the clock again. Five minutes passed. "Dude might be busy," he says. "Give him another minute."

Castiel does not show up in the next minute, or the next five. Or ten.

Dean starts pacing, looking at the sky, half praying half just speaking to the empty air in front of him. "Hey Cas? Forget to check the watch or something? Time to pick us up."

He looks around. The town is still the western town they spent the last twenty four hours in, Sunrise, Wyoming. Not Bobby's place, definitely not Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Something is not right.

"Dean," Sam says slowly, pointing out the obvious. "Cas's never late for anything."

"He has wings, he can literally fly to any time anywhere, 'cause he'd never be late for anything." Dean says, staring at the clock with even more attention than he had with the phoenix during the duel, as if the solution is somehow hanging on the tip of one metal clock finger.

"Then why do you think...?" Sam doesn't have to finish his sentence.

"I don't know." Dean forces out a breath, pushing down the unease in his gut. "Let's just wait inside. Maybe he'll come just in a bit."

<br>

They sit by the sticky bar table in the Saloon. Elkins pours them each a glass of beer -- still tasting like horse piss but Dean manages to let it slide down the throat. If he has to stay here longer, might as well start getting used to it.

"You boys alright?" Elkins eyes them while cleaning a glass with a piece of brown yellow clothes god knows has been used for how long.

Dean swallows the liquid. "Yeah, yeah," he says, forcing a smile. "Just waiting for a friend to come by."

"Someone late for the date night?" the bartender reads his face, half joking.

"You can say that." Dean's too lazy to retort.

<br>

The saloon has some bar food too, they use them as the dinner.

The night soon falls on them. There is still no sign of Cas.

"You want to, umm," Sam shifts in the stool next to him, "-- get a room for the night?" He nods toward the wooden "Room" sign below the saloon's signboard.

Dean checks his watch. It's been ten hours.

He empties the glass and stands up. "Yeah ok, let's go." Then adds, "But not here."

"What's wrong with here?"

Dean's eyes sweep through the saloon girls gathering and giggling around the base of the staircase, sounds of cheap bed shaking are remotely audible. His eyes land back on Sam's, raising the eyebrows that can speak by themselves: *Serious?*

Sam hums. "Good point."

They go back to the sheriff's office. With both the sheriff and the deputy down, that place is just a whole big empty room waiting to be claimed.

Dean leads them back in there. The deputy's charred skeleton is still behind the bar, the air burnt flesh. Dean decides to not think about that for now. He wanders around the place, looking for anything available to claim for their use.

"You seem to fit the place well enough." Sam observes.

Dean gives him a look, fingering the sheriff's pin on his shirt. "You kidding me? I'm officially the sheriff in town, so yeah, this is legitimately my place now, 'course I fit in here."

"Not just in here," Sam supplements. "Everything, the shirt, the duel, the horse. People might actually buy in that you're from this time, which, of course, is a good thing."

Slow understanding starts kicking in. Dean looks up from the lost-and-found bucket he's been scrounge, squinting, "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying," Sam pauses, looking him in the eyes, considering the words carefully. "We might have to stay here for quite some time, might as well blend in."

"No, no," Dean straightens up. "Cas is going to be here shortly. Maybe not tonight short, but tomorrow or something. He -- he won't keep us waiting for too long."

If he says it with enough confidence, he can convince himself too, isn't it?

"Then how long?" Sam pulls a mocking smile. "You don't even believe it yourself."

Dean breaks the gaze, impatient. "So what? You think Cas's gonna just dump us in here? In the middle of the wild, right on the edge of the Civil War?"

"Thought you'd like that," Sam says, easing around, grabbing a chair to sit down. "Isn't it your dream life? Since like six?"

Dean is muted for a second, frowning at him. "What? No! Yeah? I mean -- not like this!"

He trails off, giving their surrounding a quick look around. The bars, the officer's wooden desk, a couple lousy chairs, the walls with peeling paper, some random jacket and whip or something scattering around. The air smells dust and horse.

"Not like this." He lands on it, going back to check the drawers under the desk. "Cas will come, I assure you. Just give him a bit time. He'll come. He always do."

"What if he can't? What if something happened to him, and he's... he's too weak to time travel, or even dead?"

"Don't say that!" Dean snaps, jerking his head up from behind the desk, glaring at his brother. "Nothing's gonna happen to him, alright? Dude gets his full power back, new and improved, and he's leading a full army Upstairs! Must be just in the middle of war prepping meeting or something." He glances at the ceiling reflexively, as if he can see the Heaven like that.

"I'm just being realistic," Sam says in a calm but worried voice. "Why else would he be late? We both know he's in a war and Raphael is on his tail. And we have no idea how bad the things are with his war, I mean, not really. That lieutenant angel, Rachel or something? Says they're in a bad position, isn't it? Balthazar said something similar before. We didn't even ask how bad."

"Cas is fine." That's all Dean can think of to say. He swallows, closing the eyes for a second and reopening. He doesn't know that, but that's the only thing he can say. Only thing he has to hold on to. "He survives so many apocalypses before, surely Raphael can't be worse than Lucifer, right?"

He doesn't mean to bring up the Lucifer thing, that time no more than a year ago when Cas was face to face with *both* Michael and Lucifer, right before he got exploded by the Devil. He flinches, the power of archangel has always been just an expression in his mind that he doesn't give much thought to, but what if...

He shakes his head, dragging himself away from that train of thought. "We don't know anything, so let's not freak ourselves out just by thinking about the worst, eh? Now, move your ass over here and help me find if there's some blanket or something around for the night."

<br>

"You boys still hanging around?" Elkins gives them a nod while serving some other town folks the next day. "Thought you'd move on by now."

"Believe me, we want to, but eh.. still waiting for the ride." Dean gives him one of those convincing smiles he has perfected over the years with the case victims and authorities.

"There are a few spare horses around here if it's a ride you want." The bartender offers, being as kindly as any old western man can be.

"Uh, we actually..." Sam starts.

"You know what, that would be awesome." Dean cuts him off, smiling brightly at the old man.

They use the gold they bring along to pay off the food and drink before heading out. Didn't get any suspicious look.

"I'd give this one to Bobby." Dean murmurs under breath when they walk out of the saloon. "Era of no plastic but all gold, I wouldn't know what to do if we don't have those."

The bag of gold is still heavy on his shoulder. The weight of wealth and reassurance.

Sam scoffs. "No credit card fraud or pooling this time."

Dean looks back over his shoulder, eyes sprinkling with cunning joy. "Ha, but there's still poker. You never know what skill could come handy or even save our ass some time a hundred fifty years in the past, don't you, Sammy?"

Sam shakes his head, laughing.

<br>

The horses Elkins pointed to them belong to the late Judge and old Sheriff. One beautiful black horse with furs so bright and smooth it almost reminds him of the Impala.

"Hey baby," Dean strokes its back, voice gentle, love flowing from his eyes, "you miss me?"

"Dean, I don't think she'd ever known you." Sam snorts.

Dean gives him a stern look, "You don't know that." He shifts the attention back to the beauty, its muscle strong and warm under his palm. "We might have met in our previous lives or something. Tell me she's not exactly like Baby to you?"

Sam tilts his head, regarding the horse, tip of his lips curls. "Hmm." he has to agree.

The other tan brown horse with a white stripe on the nose decides to throw its temper at Sam for a few moments when he approaches, but eventually lets him tie the saddle and pats on the back.

<br>

They don't really have anywhere in mind to go, with the horses. But they are still over delighted to have them. Dean, especially.

Days later, when he's grooming the Baby -- of course he has to name her after the real Baby -- Sam tells him, chuckling, "You have any idea how much it's like watching you wash the car?"

Dean doesn't look back from his busy work by hand, "I don't know, Sam, just the me in the other life, I guess."

Sam's chuckle stops. The silence makes Dean glance back.

"What?" he asks, slowing down the handwork.

"I didn't even realize how settled in we already are, like we're *actually* already in another life." Sam frowns. "Almost forget to count how many days it's been, since..."

"Since March the fifth," Dean says for him. "Since the day the phoenix died and Cas was supposed to meet us up, yeah I remember. Kinda hard to forget, don't you think?"

The glass bottle of phoenix ash is still tucked under his jacket, just in case if he has to be pulled away in a hurry, he'd make sure the reason why they're here in the first place wouldn't get lost.

Sam swallows, giving Dean a quick glance, a little sheepishly, "So is it time we finally start talking?"

"About what?"

"About what to do if Cas never come, if he just can't, and we might have to figure out our own way back?"

Dean stares at him, face grim, brows knitted tight. Eventually he sighs, giving in the stare, licking his lips. "Ok, yeah, you might be right. Can't put all the burden on the man, he might even need our help back home."

<br>

### Chap.1-2 (Cas wake up)(Bobby's, 2011, Bobby POV+Cas)

> **Outline:** Cas passes out for longer than in canon, when he comes to it's past 24h and he's super weak and wounded. He doesn't want to risk Bobby's soul and can't leave the boys behind, but also like he mentioned, now they are lost to him, so he'd have to fight hard in the time flux to find them.

Bobby paces the living room, a few steps in front of the sofa where a bleeding out angel passed out.

"Balls." It might be the hundredth or thousandth time he curses. He doesn't bother counting.

The countdown on the clock is running out fast. Cas doesn't show any sign of waking up.

Bobby frowns deep, throwing looks between the clock and Cas every other second.

Cas crashed into the kitchen little more than three hours ago, leaving a bloody sigil on the fridge door, and practically went straight into the coma. No explanation.

"Balls." Bobby curses under his breath again, staring at the unconscious angel.

The timer soon hits zero. The boys would be waiting in the goddamn wild west a hundred fifty years in the past, the only angel in the room is not waking up. Both waiting for him to save the day, what's he gonna do, wrapping a wing that's never there?

"Ok Cas, don't smite me or anything," Bobby approaches the sofa gingerly, thinking twice, then shaking Cas's shoulder. First not quite harshly, then a lot more. But still, the eyes are closed, the cut on his abdomen is bleeding some ominous bright light.

Bobby slaps his face -- also started easy, all things considered, then a lot less so. But nothing works.

Bobby runs out of idea.

"Balls" is not enough for him given the circumstance. He'd need a stronger word.

<br>

There might be a spell or something useful in the books. Bobby jumps back into the familiar realm, diving into the lore and magic, looking for something that may remotely give some hope, of either bringing the boys home by himself or waking up the angel.

He did wrap a bandage on Cas's abdomen, trying vainly to stop the angelic bleeding. Not gonna do anything to the celestial creature in his true form, sure, Bobby figured that, but maybe healing the vessel might just help him recover a little bit faster? With nothing by hand, all he can do is hope.

And pray.

He has to pray for all of them now. But if not to Cas, to whom?

Glancing at the bloody sigil with Cas's fingerprint that is visibly gradually drying out, it can be a big mistake. Bobby downs a glass of whiskey before doing that.

"Well, call me stupid but none of you are here stopping me, so here goes nothing." Bobby looks up at the ceiling.

"Whatever angel out there," he says, grumpily, can't decide whether to keep the eyes open or shut, settled with squinting, "uh, hope you're on our side. Could use a little help here."

The sigil on the fridge door brightens up, burning into a lit-up golden color, as bright as the light leaking from inside Cas, then dying out slowly. The pattern seems a little shallower than before, muffled, Bobby observes, not sure what it means.

No angel shows up. Not sure if it's good or bad news, either.

Bobby turns back to the books for help.

<br>

Bobby doesn't close his eyes in the first night. The letters on the pages start swimming.

Castiel is still not responding to anything. Face pale, body cold.

Bobby examines his wound -- while murmuring "I don't have a goddamn PhD in angel medics, just so you know" -- the cut is deep, the leaking light is blinding, but Bobby decides it's not as blinding as yesterday. Could be hopeful thinking though, or his eyes are just getting adjusted to angel grace.

He sighs long and deep. "Should have talked them out of this, told you it's a bad idea, but who'd listen?"

The next day passes in the books and regular checks with the angel and alcohols. So is the day after.

Bobby is getting increasingly desperate. "Never thought I'd lose the boys like this, in a time even before they're born."

He slams Castiel's collar, shaking him a lot more violently. "You gotta wake up, Cas." his voice practically pleading. "The boys are waiting for you! Dean's waiting for you!"

Cas lets out a pained groan.

Bobby loosens the grip, putting him down. "Cas?"

Exhaling sharply, Castiel wakes up. Eyes opening slowly, staring straight into the space in front of him, blank, then onto Bobby's screwed face, confused.

He frowns deep, trying to pull himself up from the sofa but wobbly so much that he crashes back down the minute he puts the weight on the legs.

"There he is." Bobby breathes out, not exactly relieved but at least lighter than the past seventy something hours. He lends a hand to help Cas balance. "What happened?"

Castiel tears open the bandage, palm covering the wound. The light and human blood mix together and seep out from between his fingers. He grimaces, telling him with furrowed frown, "I was, uh... I was attacked, betrayed by one of our own."

"Should see the other guy, right?" Bobby tries putting a light tone there.

Castiel probably doesn't get the reference, he answers anyway. "Rachel -- I had to kill her. But I was wounded. Need to use some safety, so... thank you."

"You mean that finger painting?" Bobby eyes the sigil that he has stared for so long over the past few days that he'd already memorized the thing. It's barely visible now. Only a smudged blood stain.

Cas follows his eyes, frowning deeper. "Is there any other angels coming around this place while I was unconscious?" he glares at Bobby.

Bobby shrugs. "Not that I know of."

Cas looks into him, voice graver. "Did you... pray to them?"

Bobby tilts his head, having a bad feeling but has to defend himself. "Well, you're out, boys need a ride home, what else was I supposed to do? So yeah, distress call."

Cas looks like he was about to snap, but decides at the last minute to turn it into a sigh. His lips thin into a line. "You might just put both of us in extreme danger -- me, especially. Since Raphael might already hear it and find where I am, or at least close enough. I could be dead any minute by now if it's not still shielding me."

Defeated, Bobby takes half a step back, trying to give Cas some space as he gives another attempt to stand up. "Well, I'm sorry. I guess. Was really out of option there."

"How long was I unconscious?" Cas leaves the sofa, walking shakily toward the desk.

"Three days, give or take." Bobby answers, without having to check the time. "Now would really be a good time to bring the boys home. Should have enough fun in the Frontierland by now."

"I can't." Cas drops his head, facing away from Bobby.

"Come again?"

"The fight... it drained me." Cas shifts his feet. Uneasy. "And it's been too long. They're lost to me already."

Bobby scowls at his back, snapping. "Then found them! You can't just leave Sam and Dean in the past like that!"

"I know." Castiel turns back, looking at Bobby in the eyes, solemnly. Determined. "So I'll still go, and try my best, but I don't know what's the chance. If I don't make it back..." he breaks the gaze, "please know that I'm truly sorry and I mean it."

With that, and a disturbance of wind flow in the room, Castiel is gone.

"What does that --" Bobby takes two steps ahead, right next to where the angel was, but it is so clear there is nothing left there anymore.

### Chap.2-1 (Dean leave Sunrise)(Sunrise, 1861, Dean)

> **Outline:** Dean prays to Cas but doesn't get answer, they figure Cas said they're lost to him, so the idea is to do something "noisy" (big enough to get some notice from the future but not too big to disturb the history) so that their existence might be like some beacon in the timeline, hopefully making it easier for Cas to locate.
>
> Dean goes ahead start doing the reckless noisy things, Sam stay behind at Samuel Colt's place continue researching (time travel spell: angel feather, sands of time, tears of a dragon)

"Get out of my house." Samuel Colt grumbles, without bothering lifting his head. His colt on the desk by his hand -- a normal one, not the special one he'd already given to them.

"I'm really sorry to bother you again," Sam steps gingerly ahead, Dean follows him a few steps behind. "I wouldn't bother you if it's not absolute urgent."

"Thought I already did my share of help." He eyes them. "Don't tell me the Colt didn't work on the creature you're hunting."

"No, it's not that." Dean chimes in, "It worked, but uh... it's something else we can use a little help there."

"What part of *I'm retired* failed you?"

*Jesus, Samuel is clearly not an easy one to work with.* Dean thinks quietly, eyebrow raised a few inches.

"Like I said, in our time, you're sort of a really big deal, the most famous hunter -- " Sam manages a tight smile, as friendly as he can pull.

"Heard you the first time."

"So we figure you'd be the best supernatural researcher around here too." Dean pulls an puffery grin with his best effort.

"Please, we are not asking you to hunt with us or anything," Sam continues. "Just need a little help in research."

<br>

It turns out their guess isn't too far off. Samuel has as big of a book collection as Bobby's or Campbell's, right downstairs in the place where a cellar should be, but with tons more additional traps and sigils painted on every inch of floor and walls.

Panic room *and* library, nice. *Classic.* Dean looks around, thinking how *fun* it must be to be able to spending all the time reading while hiding out here.

Sam nudges him, eyeing the rows of books. He nods back.

Research time.

<br>

"Don't you think if there's a way to pull it off here and now, someone would have done that already?" Dean puts a book down after god knows how many hours, wiping his face by his hands, giving his brain some break. "Then why didn't we ever run into people time-traveled from the past all the time?"

Sam doesn't move his eyes away from whatever he's scanning. "They don't know what we know." he deadpans.

*But they don't know much about this time thing, either.* Dean thinks. It's always just Cas swinging them around, or some other douchebag angels occasionally. Just popping in and out, not really much theory or science to learn about.

Should probably have asked a few more questions about how time flux thing works. He realizes belatedly. But after all, not everyone is as nerdy as Sam.

"I just remember Cas said once that time travel isn't easy but not impossible," Dean thinks hard, poking some corner of old memories, the time when he met mom and dad when they were younger than his age, the other time when they were trying to stop the yellow-eyed demon but still failed utterly, even the time when he got flipped to the messed-up five years into the zombie land future that turns out never would come. What did Cas tell him during those short talks?

"He said that time is fluid, it's not easy, but apparently the angels have no problem bending it once in a while."

Sam jerks his head up, eyes bright with understanding, "And he also told us this time before we left, that the further back he sent us, the harder it becomes to retrieve us, that's why he said we can't stay for more than twenty four hours, or we'd be lost to him."

"Which means we are totally lost to him by now and no way home without the wings." Dean says bitterly.

"No, Dean!" Sam jumps to his feet. "That might be the idea! This book here also said something similar, quite many are saying the same thing actually, I just didn't realize they might be literal, thought it's more metaphorical."

He slides the book over with some illustration that looks like a river with sand banks on its sides, "Imagine the time is like river or something, fluid, rapid turbulence flow of some kind, and each of us is like a floating leaf. Cas can bend the waterway so it becomes non-chronological, the downstream touches the upstream, that's how we landed here. And folding some part off would be to fast-forward into the future. But if we stay here for too long, we are like the leaves washed away by the flow by too far, that's probably why he can't find us, because he doesn't know where we are in the time flux anymore."

Dean's brows knit into a knot. "So... If we make some noise, *splash!* Fish jump out of water, we can make ourselves stand out in this timeline river somehow, so he can find us."

"Like temporal beacons. It might work -- assuming Cas is still out there looking for us." Sam's voice gets quieter at the last clause.

"He's out there." Dean says reflexively. Sam doesn't look convinced.

Dean gives the river picture a second look-over, thinking it over again, a minor smile starts showing. "Sounds like a plan to me. What kind of noise are we talking about?"

Sam looks a little caught by the question, shrugging unsurely. "How would I know? Something big enough to get some notice in the future, I guess? I would definitely notice if your face show up in some old western posters, guess you can finally make a name for yourself in this era, like you always wanted, huh?"

Sam throws a half smile in his brother's direction, knowing him too well.

Dean's eyes glints. "Any catch I need to know before messing up the time?"

Tip of Sam's mouth twitches. "Just like you said but, eh... don't mess up the time too much? Butterfly effect, remember? We just came back from the Titanic world like, last week?"

Dean returns an unimpressed look. "Let me, umm, just try one more time, just to be sure."

Glancing up, he prays hard and loud, "Castiel, Angel of the Lord, if you have your ears on, come pick us up here, alright? Or we're gonna do something that can *possibly* break the history, you hear me?"

He waits. One second. Two seconds. Three seconds. No stir of air, no wings, no feathered angel. No Cas.

Dean breathes out. "Okay then, let's do this, make some noise! Fun time!"

"Umm," Sam has a look of reluctance, slowly sitting back down.

Dean narrows his eyes. "You're not coming with me."

Sam spreads his hands wide, empty palms facing up -- all they have is a big pile of nothing. Resigned, he says, "Look, Dean, I know how much faith you have on Cas, I really hope I do too, but we just don't know. We could break the history and timeline and everything, and Cas might never come, and we would still be stuck here. I'm gonna find another way, a spell or something, things we can do *by ourselves*, swim our way back if we can."

"And you'll just stay here the whole time, researching?" Dean throws a quick glance at the stairs leading out of the cellar. "Samuel here doesn't look like he welcomes any guest, let alone long-term tenant."

"Not too different from Bobby?" Sam curls up his lips a little.

Dean considers, huffing a quiet laughter. "Yeah, right, we are professionals in handling half-retired grumpy old drunk hunters."

They exchange an agreeing look. So it is decided.

Dean stands up, moving around the table, leaning in to give his brother a half-hug.

"See you around then, Sammy." He pats his back slightly before pulling back. "I'll drop by picking you up after I find Cas."

"And how do I find you, if I find the spell?" Sam asks.

Dean smiles. "Read the newspaper."

<br>

"So, you finally decide to move on?" Elkins gives him a once-over. "Where's your brother?"

Dean has a red bandana wrapped around his mouth. He changed into new shirt and pant -- new for him, old for the clothes -- dirt and stains making him look exactly like the rest of the folks in the place.

*The look of a pilgrim,* Dean realizes.

He doesn't answer. Just strides straight into the room, heading directly for the bartender they've grown familiar with over the past couple of days. Dean lets out a breath, tasting a tad of bitterness lingering on the tip of his tongue.

Drawing the pistol from the holster at his waist in a smooth swing, he fires three shots into the ceiling. Some girls scream behind him.

Elkins looks at him, reaching for something hidden underneath the bar stand. Supposedly a shotgun.

"I suggest not." Dean shifts his aim toward him. The bartender stops moving, hands slowly rising.

"What's this about?" The old man is still surprisingly chill, not even showing much curiosity.

*Just how many gangsters has he run into before?* Dean finds himself wondering.

"What every outlaw around here wants," he says, aiming for a deep, grave voice. "You got any hidden treasure around here? Gold would do too."

"At least leave me a name to pass your story along?" Elkins slowly reaches for a side drawer in his gaze. The gold he offers includes some of the very pieces they paid for their meals over the past few days. Dean has to push down the unease.

"Eastwood. Clint Eastwood. Best gunner in the western world," Dean tells him, with a mocking smile.

"We'll see about that." Three gunshots are released within the next second. Not Dean's this time. He dives behind an overturned dining table. A bullet narrowly misses his cheek, air squeaks sharp and heated.

"Son of a bitch!" He shouts out. Dirt on the ground flies into air, the room is hazy for a second. He can't see much.

Dean blinks hard, looking left and right, trying to figure out what now.

"What the hell?" he thinks out loud. Guess the first rodeo isn't always very successful even for bonafide western gangsters.

"Well, *Hell* sends regards." Elkins' steps are right in front of the table. Dean risks a glimpse, catching the sight of black eyes.

"Freaking demon!" He growls, at the same time of ducking into a gap between the stools, exactly when the table he was hiding behind gets shot a gun hole around the place where his heart would have been.

A second gun shot is fired from behind him. Damnnit, *demons*, plural. A whackload of them, it seems.

He hears giggling from the same direction where the gunshot comes, the place where the saloon ladies usually gather. If they are all possessed, he counts four already.

Even with the Colt he hasn't really had won any advantage over that many demons all at once, and god knows how many more might crawling in as they speak.

"Surprised to see us?" Elkins' voice sounds harsh and edgy, nothing like what he sounded like when he spoke with them in the past. "We kill everyone close to Samuel Colt, just so you know."

"Huh, usually the other way around," Dean amuses. "So this is how it's like to hanging around with a big name."

"You are some big name, boy?" The demon in Elkins smirks.

"That's the goal." Dean answers absent-mindedly, while tightens the grip on the pistol, silently counting the number of bullets he has left. *A bit low on ammo already,* he shifts the grip slightly, thinking, *he has to figure a way out fast*.

The exit door is two tables' distance away, with the three lady demons in between, but the side window is only one table away, with buckets of alcohols within range. He calculates his route.

The demons circle closer. Their footsteps heavy, dresses of the ladies rustle relentlessly.

Dean risks another look from the edge of his hideout. All of them have a gun in their hands. Since when do demons kill human with guns? Western cowboy demons? He teases the thought, finding it not as unpleasant as he thought.

The demon possessing the bartender lets out a raspy laughter. "You will die, Clint Eastwood."

"Huh, it's actually nice hearing people say that, you know. Sorta the point, could be a line for the movies." Dean estimates the timing and the distance, swinging a stool at the foot of the closest demon girl, diving side way. Darla, the saloon girl cornered him the first day, yells angrily, eyes turning black, swooping for him.

"Sorry about that." Dean says, a bit apologetically. Then dives for the bucket stack, kicking them loose.

A bucket rolls into the center of the saloon, alcohol leaking from a crack, leaving a wet trail as it goes. The second one follows, making the trail a pool, soaking the next one inside out.

Dean leaps out of the place through the window right before the demons shoot the spot he was in. Bullets and sparks catch the alcohol, the whole place turns into a big pile of flame and smoke in seconds. Demons hiss furiously inside.

The second floor crumbles down in the flame. Dean only then realizes he forgets to check if there is any human up there, but it's too late already.

He unleashes the horse by the stable, galloping out of the town, heading west without looking back.

<br>

He doesn't slow down until the burning hut is completely out of the view. The sun is setting ahead of him on the horizon. He eases the rein, letting the horse stroll.

Dean glances back at the wild plain territory behind him, barely anything to see. Barren and wild, cactus and weed growing from sand, no sign of civilization.

"No coming back to Sunrise, Wyoming now." He sighs, patting the duffel bag and roll of blanket wrapped tightly on the back of the horse, the same way he'd check the Impala's trunk has everything he needs for the road.

Dean removes the Sheriff's pin from his shirt. "Didn't expect the first gig end up like that, goddamn demons always ruin the day."

He strokes the neck of the horse gently, speaking to her as much as to himself, "What do you think, that's a loud enough distress call to Cas or not?"

He looks up at the sky. The night is falling slowly, the color transitions from dark blue to deep purple. Some stars that are incredibly bright already start shining and blinking above these lands. Light pollution isn't a thing yet.

Pure universe hanging on top of him like a gigantic globe hull, celestial, but not in a biblical way.

Dean lets his fingers combing through horse's hair, feeling the creature's muscle rise and fall as it jogs. "Yeah, I know." He says quietly, "Probably not."

Him not being home already is proof by itself.

"Looks like just you and me and the whole wild west now, Baby." He pats the horse. "Come on then, let's head west and make some more noise, he'd have to hear one of them. Good thing all the land between here and the ocean are free to go."

The whole wild west ahead of him, free to explore.

But Dean isn't anywhere near ecstasy. It's just too damn far away from home.

### Chap.2-2 (Cas time travel)(Time flux, Cas+Raphael)

> **Outline:** Cas's in no condition to time travel but he worries about Dean too much so he risks flying into the time flux in his wounded state, leaving bloody trace behind. His trace exposes him, Raphael follows him into the time flux, so he has to escape the chase while tries to locate Dean, Cas crash lands in Sunrise Wyoming but Dean's not there.

"This is stupid, even for you." The thundering voice sounds up above him. Cas doesn't need to look up to know who has found him.

The stab pierces through the abdomen of the vessel, but it's even worse for his true form. The outer ring gets a deep cut through, almost reaching the middle ring. The root of one of the right wings is also wounded. He can barely fly straight.

*It's like leaving blood trace behind in the open sea,* he thinks distantly. *He's the drowning swimmer, attracting the sharks.*

"Thought I can at least have a head start before you catch up." Cas answers. Beating his wings the hardest he can. The pain tears through his wings with each slap. But he has to keep going.

Below them, the time flux is flowing, bright and sparkling. Almost like flying in the space, appreciating the galaxy. In a way, time is no different from space.

"So you know I'd found you, sooner or later." Raphael amuses. The flow from the archangel's wings disturbs this time dimension like a tornado sweeping through wild plain. "I didn't know you're the suicidal type."

"Not suicidal." Cas dives lower, avoiding the central turbulence, trying to use the left wings to remedy the wounds on the right side. He doesn't bother checking if the bleeding of grace is getting worse. The bandage Bobby helped wrapping him with didn't do anything. His essence is running out fast.

He's running out of time too.

*Not suicidal. It's desperate.*

It's actually funny. Cas's mind somehow wanders away. If Dean is here, he'd definitely make a remark about how you can even running out of time when you're literally *in* the time dimension, scouting the time flux.

He can't think of any joke himself.

*Not suicidal, but just for finding the people too important to lose.* He just need enough time to find them before Raphael gets a hold of him and undoubtfully damns him into the eternality of killing him over and over again.

The time flux has an urgent turn around nineteenth century, with the Civil War and everything, the history is not so easy to make out. Cas squints his eyes, focusing on the reflections in the time flux --

That's when he loses his balance suddenly. A harsh tear on tip of his top left wing makes him gasp in pain, the inner ring shrinks in reflex, like how a human would yell and jump back at an unexpected strike of pain.

Cas curls his left wings for self-protection, dropping the flying height. Raphael's big shadow swooping right on top of him, like an eagle diving for its prey sparrow.

He manages a sharp turn to avoid the followed attack. The tip of the lower wings dipping into the time flux, catching a damp from the early twentieth century.

Cas resets his rings and wings, swirling backwards.

"You do know it is pointless to fight or hide from me, do you?" Raphael mocks, turning around as well, following him two wings' distance away.

"How do you find me?" Cas asks, hoping vainly that the talks might distract the archangel for a split of heartbeat time for a break, while widening all the eyes he has to scan through the time flux. It's been a while since he has to fight in the time dimension in his true form, even longer to have to find a soul in here, if ever.

But surely the familiarity and the profound bound should make it easier? Cas starts getting anxious, finding the time flux all look the same rapid and more confusingly dazzling than he remembers. Something disturbing is going on in these western times, but he doesn't know what, and Dean is there, going through the weird time and history on his own, without wings and without protection.

Cas flaps his wings more rapidly, bearing all the tearing sensation in the rings and wings. Not caring that the more rapid he goes, the faster the grace is bleeding and losing, spilling from his true form like dripping blood along the way.

Then for the second time, the disturbance in the air hits him sharp from the center, he almost falls directly into the time flux below.

The archangel didn't even unleash his supernova-explosion-level grace, just using the tips of his wings that are as sharp as any metal in the universe that can ever be, almost cutting him in half.

Castiel screams in pain in his true voice. The time dimension echoes his sound. Raphael laughs behind him in satisfaction.

"I can smell your bleeding grace from two galaxies away, Castiel." Raphael tells him, tone satisfying. "Let alone that human you hang out with, gave us a loud and clear coordinate. So give up, Castiel, you can't hide from me in any time or space. I will always find you, and I will always destroy you."

The second swing of cutting comes from the other side, Cas hears it coming before it hits him, he ducks sideways. The archangel's feathers are like natural angel blades, they scratch his innermost ring, missing the heart of his essence by mere inches.

He might be killed any minute now. Cas thinks bitterly. And then Dean and Sam would be trapped in the western wasteland in the past, forever. They won't even reach the time when the first Impala was ever produced when they die of old age -- *if* they die of old age. They won't ever come back home again.

Cas blinks his eyes hard, opening all his wings again, wounded or not, shooting upwards. Directly into Raphael from below. The rings around his essence spin fast and urgent, like a rapidly beating heart.

Raphael doesn't expect the change of direction in his moves. He has no time of diverting.

Castiel uses his whole existence as bullet, the momentum as the fuel, hitting Raphael in his most vulnerable ring -- the same part in Cas that is beating and spinning glaringly, the innermost ring around the essence. Raphael is pushed out of balance, for a split of heartbeat time, out of control of where he's heading.

Castiel catches the blink of opportunity when Raphael does not have eyes on him, diving straight into the time flux below him.

The time dimension swirls and rotates around him, sucking him into the point he chooses. The speed of rotation makes his rings twist and deform. No wonder every time he pops Dean in and out, he'd complain about motion sickness. This must be the exact dizziness a human would feel if he doesn't have any grace left.

The thought makes his heart thumps hard.

*Did he lose all the grace just to reach them? How is he gonna take them home now?*

Without any answer to any of the questions, his feet land on the solid ground again. Castiel tumbles ahead, dropping on his all fours, spitting blood onto the sandy ground in front of him. The view is swimming, the ground is floating up and down as if he's being washed away by the tide. He has to focus very hard to not let the cold, shaky limbs give way here and now.

Wind blows, the sand rises around him. The vessel coughs, more blood dripping, from everywhere, not just from his mouth.

Cas only gets time to see a wooden sign with a neat carving saying "Sunrise, WYO." before the world turns total black.

>
> (Dean pray to Cas every night, bad feeling)

#### Act 1 ("Unforgiven")

The life on road on horseback and the life on road in car has more similarity than Dean has ever realized. Like the quietness in the night, the road and space all dark, when it seems the whole world dissolves, leaving only him and the Baby floating in the space.

Except, with the black horse, with its rising and falling rhythm of muscle, the feeling of being accompanied by some living, breathing thing is somehow so very soothing. Almost as if he's accompanied by someone he knows.

Dean presses his palms on the horse's back, just to feel its heartbeat. Then slowly feeling his own heartbeat calming down.

He looks up at the starry sky, closing his eyes, exhaling deep, smelling the sand and bushes. *Where are you, man?* He can't help thinking, not even sure if that's a prayer or just a haunting thought keep replaying itself in his mind.

He lets the horse decide the road for him, leaving his own mind wandering -- that's another similar yet different experience as driving, one he can actually taking eyes off the road long enough and need not to worry about crushing into another incoming vehicle.

When the night is deep into the dark and cold hour, he lets the horse rest. Finding a relatively soft spot on the sandy lands, wrapping himself in the blanket, he rests his own eyes for a handful of hours. Then moves on again before the sun fully rises.

Dean thinks about that illustration image of the time flux all the time. The shape of a river, and a floating leave flowing down the stream. He feels exactly like that floating leave now.

<br>

There are towns scattered here and there on the western lands like stars in the night sky. Without a map, Dean doesn't know how exactly he can find one, but the horse knows the ways better than he does. Sometimes he wonders how many places she has already been to.

She leads them into a small town, its name reads Thunderhill, Colorado, according to the wooden plaque swinging outside of the town.

The place looks like a replica of Sunrise, Wyoming, except the main road through the town is wider. Men in fine and well suits come and go on horsebacks, ladies in delicate, laborious dresses. The view is actually somewhat pleasant to enjoy, but Dean is not here for sightseeing.

He goes into the saloon -- at least this has to be universal in all times and all places, there must always be a saloon in each western town, for his comfort.

The girls are more enthusiastic and younger here than Elkins' place. Dean meets their eyes -- they are old-time good-looking, mostly. They grin at him in professional smiles, Dean walks toward the owner of the place and asks for a room.

"You want to pick one you like?" The skinny man behind the counter asks meaningfully, nodding at the girls.

Dean glances back, finding their eyes intensely on his back. He gives a short chuckle, "Nah, just for sleeping."

"Your loss." The man makes a face, pointing him the stairway.

He should probably start planning his grand criminal plan some time soon. Dean thinks as he drags his steps up the stairs, feeling his bones and muscles complaining about sleeping on the wild ground for too many nights in a row, it's making his joints and neck stiff and wrecking like a beat-up car. He has to have at least one decent night before thinking about some big history-breaking-level moves.

Dean throws himself onto the bed that smells something suspicious, but probably wouldn't be too different from those cheap motels he has been used to for his whole life. Dean falls asleep like that without bothering taking his clothes off.

He is waken up several hours later by some loud crying and yelling by the next door. A man is angrily shouting "Whore!" and cursing, and a girl is screaming helplessly. Something is thrown to the floor, crashing to pieces.

Dean jumps to his feet, dashing out to the next room without thinking.

A man twice bigger than him is standing on the lone bed in the center of the room, all naked and hairy, holding a knife in his hand high above head, almost touching the ceiling.

The crying girl curls at the corner of the bed like a startled little creature, wrapping herself up in arms, covering the face with fingers. Unclothed and crying loudly, screaming for her life. Blood streaming from between her fingers.

Dean recognizes her from the group of saloon ladies that greeted him when he arrived.

He approaches the man carefully, eyeing the knife, shortening their distances, tone demanding, "Why don't you put the knife down and let's talk?"

The man glances back at him for a split second, grumbles, "Go away. None of your business."

"It's my business because I was waken up." Dean takes another step ahead, barely a dive's distance away from him now. He tries to hint the girl to get away while the man's distracted, but the girl is just busy crying. He can't tell where that blood comes from and it worries him.

"Very well." The man gnarls. "I'll deal with you once I kill the bitch."

"Can't let you do that." Dean marches the remaining two steps in a heartbeat, arms dragged around the man's waist, pulling him off balance and falling off the bed. The knife is still in his hand.

The man struggles violently and gets loose from Dean's hold, fumbling on to his feet, throwing himself at him.

Dean gets pinned to the ground by the weight, wrestling with all the fighting skills he has picked up over the years, but the battle techniques for creatures are not as useful on a pissed off cowboy.

The man fights like a gorilla, ending up straddling him with one hand pressing on Dean's chest, stopping him from attempts of getting away, the other hand pressing the tip of the knife on his cheek. "You should keep your nose clean." He grits the yellow teeth.

The knife feels cold against his skin. Dean wonders how much he can move his head before it stabs through his skull.

"Cleaner than yours." Dean barks back, staring the man in the eyes deadly focused as if they're in a gun duel. He moves suddenly, so quick that the other doesn't have time to react, and Dean already breaks his hands free from grasp. He twists his wrist in a way that the man has to loose the hold of the knife, and next second, the knife lands in Dean's hand.

Just in a blink's time, their positions shift. Dean holds the knife an inch away from the man's neck, but already close enough to make his point clear. The man stills.

Dean demands, "Now you want to explain what's the matter with the lady?"

Right this second, three men dash into the room, all in uniforms, with a sheriff's pin on the chest of the leading aged man.

"Put down your knife, for Christ's sake!" Three shotguns point at him. The Sheriff steps closer, solemnly, eyes moving between both him and the man in his compliance.

Dean knows better than carrying a knife to a gun fight with three cowboy lawmen.

He lets his hand fall and tied behind his back by a rough rope. The other guy tied to the same wooden stake on the ground.

The Sheriff glares between them. "Now, talk!"

Dean purses his mouth, glancing at the girl in dismay at his rescue.

An elder lady is attending to her wounds. She removes the hand very slowly and reluctantly from her face. Tears are still falling down unstoppingly. A long, bloody cut diagonalizes on her young, pretty face, narrowly missed her eyes, but cutting all the way from forehead across the cheek, reaching the edge of the jaw. One that would undoubtfully leave a permanent scar on that face.

The man tied behind him grumbles, "He came out of nowhere and wanted to kill me, you saw how he moved with a knife. I have to self defend."

Dean rolls his eyes. Should have known, son of bitches around here always mouthful of lies. "Only because he's two seconds away from killing that lady."

"Bitch had it coming." He growls. Dean can feel his shrug against their tied-together back.

"What did she do?" The Sheriff asks.

The naked cowboy doesn't answer.

"Mike, what did she do?"

"She chuckled when she saw his tiny junk, that's what." The elder lady turns from cleaning the wounds on the girl's face, talking on her behalf, snapping harshly. "Now look what he did! She's ruined!"

She's not wrong, his junk dangles pitifully as he moves around earlier. Dean has to strangle a chuckle of his own, but the crowd around them isn't as generous. The cowboy Mike growls something in his breath, the sound throttled in his throat like a caged tiger huffing.

The skinny man behind the counter chimes in. "There has to be justice, Little Bill. Who would want a whore with scarred face? I bought her last spring, and it's a damaged good now. She could have served for another five ten years."

*Wow.* Dean thinks. *Talking about authenticity. The rural, cruel world for the ladies is just part of this era. Those classic movies aren't kidding.*

The Sheriff Little Bill glances between the saloon owner and the naked cowboy, then checks on Dean again. "And you're just being a good man playing hero?"

Dean shrugs. "What can I say, just another day of my life."

The Sheriff snorts, turning to the cowboy. "How many horses do you have, Mike?"

"Five." He answers.

"Alright, here's the deal. By spring, you take two of the finest horses and bring them here to Skinny. And we call it even. What do you say?" The Sheriff convicts.

"What, nothing for the girl there?" Dean blurts out, feeling ridiculous. "She's disfigured! He just ruined her whole life!"

"Why don't you wed her if you're so concerned?" Little Bill retorts.

*What an asshole.* Dean stares at the man's face, forgetting for a second he's in their land and time, wants nothing more than giving him, the shitty cowboy and the skinny saloon owner, one punch at nose for each of them. *Call it justice.*

"You are not even gonna whip him?" The elder lady heckles in disbelief.

"Isn't there enough blood shed?" The Sheriff does not look back at the ladies, simply nods at the crowds. The conviction is concluded. "Gentlemen, good night." He heads out.

The two deputies untie their hands and follow him out.

Dean exercises his numb wrist, glancing at the cowboy Mike, wondering how stupid of a move it would be if he gives him a punch again. The Sheriff is barely out of the saloon.

"Off you go, nothing to see now." Skinny shoos the crowd. "Have a good night. And you, Mr. Eastwood --" That's the name Dean registered with earlier. "-- Enough of playing hero, my girls don't need a prince in white horse, they have me. Better if you get going, you understand?"

Dean throws a glimpse at the girls again. The poor wounded one stops crying now, the other girls help wrap a gauze on her face like a pirate's blinder. Blood reddens the cloth. She looks at him, desperate, helpless. Eyes pleading. Hatred shines when she glances at the man who owns her and the man who disfigures her. But it is so clear that there is nothing she can do.

Dean takes his eyes back, walking slowly toward the counter. "Oh, I understand." He says slowly, stopping at an arm's distance away from Skinny. "But you see, I didn't come riding white horse, I came in black."

He gives the man a punch in the face. His own knuckle pained with scratches and blood just by the force in it. But it feels good. It feels right.

He reaches for his collar, aiming for a second blow. The man rises with a pistol in his hand. There is another click of gun safety switch behind his back. Dean doesn't need to look back to know who it belongs to. The girls gasp.

He releases the saloon owner, hands relaxing slowly, but edging toward the holster.

"Should have killed you when I got the chance." The cowboy says.

*Two on one. An odd chance, but not impossible.* Dean calculates. Clint Eastwood definitely could take down more than that number and make a good story. And good thing, he does have two pistols.

"Yes you should." He answers slowly. "Because now you're gonna die."

He can see the man's hand shaking. The pupils dilate. The index finger twitching on the trigger. The dark outlet of the pistol points at his heart menacingly.

Dean holds his breath. His own fingers are inches away from his pistols. The tension vibrates in the air.

Then all of a sudden, at the very same second, four gun shots go out.

Dean ducks to the ground, two pistols in hand, both smoking hot remnants of a shot. A bullet broke a glass on the bar stand. Mike lies on the ground, a bullet hole on the chest, bleeding red, already dead. Skinny falls behind the counter, moaning loud, a hole on his shoulder.

Dean stands up, without a scratch, scrutinizing the naked dead cowboy. "Think twice next time before being an asshole." He spits at him.

The wounded girl murmurs a heartfelt "Thank you" to him when he passes her to gather his belongs upstairs. And Dean returns a short nod.

This is just gonna be another town that he can never come back.

<br>

#### Act 2 ("Butch Sundance")

Dean doesn't expect to be recognized when he reaches Utah. Words travel faster than his horse, apparently.

But still not fast enough to cross the time and history and let Cas hear, it seems. He just has to keep doing what he already started, with or without a plan -- the path of a western outlaw.

The gang was playing poker at the saloon when he pushes the door open. One of them looks up first, and the rest stops the game.

"Clint Eastwood." They say, not in the most friendly tone.

Dean tenses, fingers reaching toward the pistols automatically.

They laugh loudly and drunkenly, standing up and moving to him, no one pointing guns at him. Dean lowers his hands, squinting, confused.

"Look at this good lad." The one that looks like their leader stand two steps away in front of him, glancing back at the rest of the group. They make a cheerful noise.

Dean stares at him.

"Heard you have quite some body counts on your trail, Clint, but only those who deserved it. Figured you'd try your luck around here about now." The cowboy holds out a hand. "Butch. We are the Hole-in-the-Wall, if you have been around long enough you'd hear us."

Dean huffs a laughter, shaking his hand. "Oh I've heard." He says admiringly, more enthusiastic than he intends. How can he not? The legendary Hole-in-the-Wall gang, not only does he rewatch the movie more times than he can count, but also knows the inside-out of their whereabouts and everyone's ending. Perk of time travel. But that would be years down the road, he wouldn't worry for them yet. Still early enough in time.

"I take it that must be the Sundance Kid?" Dean nods at a sharp-looking man around the desk, who didn't bother to stand up when the others did, a moustache too thick to see the lips.

Butch follows his eyes, nodding and beaming. "So you did hear about us." His tone over glad and polite. It's actually surprising to see one so affable and polite as a gangster, no wonder the gang makes their charming name in the history. If he sticks with them, maybe his name can be branded together and makes out loud like a quick pass? Dean wouldn't complain hanging out with this group if they're truly what the movie shows.

"Come join us, the round on us." Butch gestures, and Dean sits next to him. The group resumes their poker games.

"Thought you mostly hang around Wyoming?" He can't help wondering out loud. "What makes you move to Utah?"

Butch laughs while pouring him a glass. "What can I say, we run out of banks there."

"Already?" Dean amuses. There gotta be another thirty years before their lights out, would there be any bank left in the states for them to rob? He wonders, but knowing that would be a question that spoils the future and more importantly, what he knows and where he comes from, Dean is clever enough to remember to keep his mouth shut.

Butch doesn't notice his pause, just shrugs. "There will be more once we finish with Utah and Arizona and all those barbaric places. We'll come back to Wyoming again. They keep building new banks like growing harvests to reap. What a nice way of provoking new fortune, wouldn't you say?"

Dean laughs and nods, drinking the alcohol in the glass. It's not beer, and it tastes better than Elkins' stock.

"You have job in this town?" Three drinks later, Dean asks. With poker cards in his hands, the Sundance Kid is dealing.

"Right down the road, the new bank has only two guards and closes at sunset." Butch tells him. Dean wonders curiously how come no one in the place hears their loud discussion of a robbery and not raise an alarm. But glancing around, judging by how drunk most forks are and it's still in the bright afternoon, the answer isn't too difficult to realize.

"You want to join?" Butch plays his cards, glancing at him. "We can use a man like you."

Dean looks at his cards, pretending he's thinking about what to play next. "Sure." He says, picking two cards and throwing on top of the ones Butch just played.

"Kid can cover you if things go bad." Butch says in a light tone, no sign of worry or concern.

"I'm relieved." Dean answers with a smile.

They leave the saloon about half an hour before the sunset. Not all of them can walk straight, but they don't need everyone in the action anyway.

The robbery goes smoothly.

"The money isn't yours, life is. The company will pay the loss, don't try to be a hero." Butch tells the people in the bank, with a gun in his hand. Dean and the Sundance Kid by his side.

The guards don't even try to keep up a fight. Dean lock them inside the safety chamber and take the case with gold and cash out, passing to Butch.

They leave the town in galloping before the Sheriff is informed or the deputies get a chance of chasing. The town is out of view shortly, the gang cheers with the profit.

"Well, that was easy." Dean smirks.

"That's your first robbery?" Butch glances at him.

"You can say that." Dean decides the one with the demons doesn't count.

"You are a natural." Butch compliments.

They keep moving south.

<br>

Dean notices a poster of his own face outside the bank in a town in Arizona during scouting. Next to the ones of Butch and the Sundance Kid. Headlining the price of wanted. The name under his sketch is "Clint Eastwood", at least that makes he smiles a little.

He goes back to Butch and says it might not be a good idea to rob here again, the guards can probably recognize them easily enough.

"You're afraid?" Butch raises an eyebrow. "Afraid of death?"

"No." Dean defends automatically, but his thought does wander briefly imagining his own dead body lying on the bank floor, bleeding out with a gun hole to the heart, imagining Cas finds him like that, or Sam. Or no one does and they never find out what happened to him. He swallows down the lump in the throat. "But isn't it better to stay alive?"

Butch considers, agrees to skip this town.

The next town is the same, the wanted price gets even higher. The bank has more guards than they saw before, and there are patrols on the road, carrying rifles.

"That's getting ridiculous." Dean complains. "Where do they find so many people protecting some printed paper, but no one really do a girl a solid justice?"

"Welcome to the Wild West." Butch says.

"Are we switching gears now?" Dean asks. Trying to remember the timeline of events for them in the history. He still keeps in mind Sam's warning about not to mess up with the real important history stuff, and wonders what's the odds Cas can see a wanted poster of him and knows where and when he is.

"What do you mean?" Butch doesn't follow.

Dean finds himself have the big moment of realization that this very idea of robbing trains might actually comes from him. He tells them, "Where do money in banks come from?"

"The carriages?" One of the members offer.

"And where do the carriages get them from?"

"The train." Butch starts smiling.

"There is a railway line right across Arizona." Dean doesn't need an updated -- outdated, in this sense -- map to know what's the atlas is like. "We just need some dynamite."

They gather the dynamite, too much more than what they actually need, and blow the safety case to the sky. The poor clerk from the Union Pacific Flyer murmurs his protest through the whole thing, landed bloody and a broken arm after the smoke from the blast is cleared. But at least he's still alive.

Printed cash flies in the sky like falling snow flakes. The gang cheers and robs the money, stuffing as much as they can grab inside their jacket pockets and bags. Dean catches a few that fall close to him and regards the patterns and numbers on the paper. Butch watches him from the periphery of his eyes.

By night, they are out of Arizona. The small saloon in Nevada doesn't know their names or faces. They order for drinks and rooms, and accompany of the fine ladies, many of them tipping over generously with the new fortune they just gained, leaving for the second floor way earlier than the usual turn-in hour.

Dean stays by the bar, sitting in a corner seat, soaking in the drink. Some town folks are playing banjo and harps in the empty space around the tables, the music loud and cheerful, just as western as it can be. Some girls sways to the music, then dancing, some men join them soon after.

Dean watches the group as if he's just watching an old western movie up close, but he's not really expecting to be inside the scene. He remembers there was one time he was absent-mindedly watching a rerun of *The Outlaw Josey Wales* in the motel when Cas dropped by.

"The classicest of the classic, the western to rule them all." He told him.

Cas sit down next to him on the motel bed, watching the screen that was way too small. They should watch it here, like this, surrounded by music and dancing people three hundred and sixty degree immersive, that's how they could get the whole vibe.

But Cas was already attracted. And Dean was pleased he could interest Cas with a western classic, only to realize minutes later that it's the music instead of the plot that caught Cas's attention.

"It was beautiful." Cas said, in deep contemplation.

Dean glanced at him, seeing the constant frown unfold in between the angel's eyebrows. His expression calm and peaceful, watching the television with a look that says his thoughts were already wandering elsewhere. Dean wondered if it was how the real wild west was, and if Cas had been there. And he decided, he must have, being an angel and watching the earth for longer than any human history.

"But it was like?" He remembered asking him, can't help himself. "The real wild west? The towns and people's lives two hundred years ago?"

Cas tilted his head ever so slightly, recalling, "Noisy," he told him. "Very vibrant and alive. I remember the music, they were beautiful. And the people were so simple, the life was simple back then. But also bloody. A lot of blood and deaths, like the human history all the time."

He just nodded, attention back to the television, with a short glimpse at Cas once in a while. His lips curled up a little bit at that quiet, comfortable moment stretching between them. That was one of the few moments he got to relax when they were busy handling the apocalypses.

He wishes Cas is here with him, watching the dance, listening to the music. He's pretty sure Cas would enjoy it a lot and comment with something like the history of the harp or something.

"You are not like any man I saw." The voice sounds up right next to him and gives Dean quite a start he almost pulls his gun in reflexive, only to find Butch sits down on the stool next to him, with a glass of dark color liquid in his hand.

Dean relaxes his muscles, leaning back to the back of the seat. "I'm not like any other men." He replies.

"You're not after fortune but you rob." Butch observes, then adds. "Or woman, but you're certainly thinking of someone. Is there someone waiting for you to get back to, Clint?" His eyes glance temporarily on Dean's fingers where the rings are.

"You can say that." Dean takes a drag from his glass.

"Then why don't you go back to her?" Butch asks, not in a manner of probing privacy, but genuine wondering like a friend would do.

Dean decides there is no point of correcting the pronoun, just to not complicate things. "I'm on my way." He says. "We get separated, so now I need to figure out my way to home."

"You have a home to go back to." Butch looks surprised. "Most people around here don't, that's why we move all the time."

Dean hums, taking another sip, not really tasting the flavor of the liquid, wondering how the home would be like now. Bobby might be anxious to death, wandering around his study, trying all kinds of different spells and rituals; Sam should still in Samuel's place, don't know if he'd find a solution or anything closer by now; and Cas... Cas is still MIA and no one ever seen or heard of him ever since they departed that day. How long had that been? How long would they meet again if ever? What if Sam was right and Cas is already gone and... Dean takes a large gulp to wash down the growing panic in his stomach, feeling the throat still too dry.

"You alright?" Butch reads his face.

Dean hates it when people around him seem always can read his thoughts on his face. "Yeah," he finishes the drink, leaving the glass on the bar and standing up. "Need some sleep now, see you in the morning. Have a good night."

Butch nods, and wishes him a good night.

Dean lies in the saloon bed for hours, listening to the folk music continuing deep into the night, then falling quiet. His eyes on the ceiling, wondering if Cas can hear him still. He prays anyway.

### Chap.4 (Cas's western life)(Sunrise, 1841, Cas)

> **Outline:** Cas is too wounded to fly again and can't risk using his power in case he gets noticed by Raphael (still scouting in time flux), so he lives in the town like a human, also tries his best to blend in. After a while when he recovers slightly, he asks around if anyone has seen the brothers based on his description but no one does. The town looks relatively new, not so crappy, he asks time and realizes why. He asks if there is any ranch job available instead. (leave suspension)

#### draft notes

(start scene with Cas waking up with wounds, vessel has vertical cutting in the middle back, almost cut in half, bleeding in shoulder blade, old one from Rachel, internal organ bleeding, fingers gnarled; heal in human way, low in grace and can't risk checking how much left, can't risk using it to self-heal)

(facts but only reveal later in catch-up/flashbacks: To stay in the town for longer and not raise suspicion, Cas starts working in a ranch just to continue pretending to be a normal human. Cas is still weak and low in power, but as time goes by, he's growing back.)

### Chap.5 (Dean meet Cas)(Sunrise, 1861, Dean+Cas)

> **Outline:** Dean get chased around by the posse, not realize he's chased back to Sunrise, Wyoming where it all starts; get cornered into the sheriff's office, no escape, too much guns ("are they human or demons?"), Dean desperately pray to Castiel, get jump attacked by a stranger appearing from nowhere, very obviously trying to kill them and very good at fighting, and after a few rounds they realize he's not human. It's Castiel, the original 1860s timeline version, receives order that they're disturbing the timeline and comes to eliminate them (Castiel: "You pray too loud. I really don't know why you act like we are familiar" Dean: "I almost forget how big of an asshole you were before").
>
> Dean almost gets killed (heavily wounded), prays desperately instinctively again to his Cas, and gets saved when this Castiel gets blown away by power (fight a few rounds, Cas absorb 1861!Cas's grace, lighten up to show wings, wipe his memory, blast him away -> cruelest to himself, Dean: "Wouldn't that hurt... you? The old yourself?" Cas: "He has plenty time to recover, I don't." it's his own grace anyway). His Cas is there, dirty cowboy looking (reveal as part of posse), totally blend in and human-like, faceful of "I finally found you".
>
> Dean: "Where have you been?" Cas: "When." Dean: "Wh-- how long have you been here?" Cas: "Twenty years. I landed too early, so I have to wait for you to catch up, wait for time to pass in the slow old way." Dean: "I prayed to you." Cas: "I know." He can hear all the time but can't get to Dean. Dean: "What happened?"

#### draft notes

### Chap.6 (Cas look for Dean)(Wild west, 1861, Cas POV+Dean)

> **Outline:** (Cas POV, retell) Cas lands 20y ago, lives and waits, then 1861.3.5 comes, Cas arrives in saloon earlier than Dean, witnesses Sheriff burned by the phoenix Elias Finch, hiding to prevent paradox, jump attacked & trapped by demons (possessing Elkins), so can't get to Dean until the day he burns the place down, Cas free but Dean already rides away, Cas try chase him around but can't catch up
>
> Cas finds newspaper & saloon chatter about Dean become wanted, Cas join posse to follow him (also try persuade people don't shoot him), Dean keep running away from posse, until the day confronted by 1861!Cas, Cas catch up, persuade rest of posse to go in there alone, fight/blast the old self away

#### draft notes

### Chap.7 (reunion, go home)(Sunrise+Bobby's, 1861+2011, Dean+Cas)

> **Outline:** Cas heals Dean and himself, Dean caring, Cas only hints the last 20y are tough but not enough detail (some talk, Dean's imagined ranch life with Cas)
>
> Cas flies them home (pick Sam up), back to the same day they leave for the phoenix's ashes. Bobby is still there, exactly the same as before, everything the same. (Or not exactly, Dean's western fame gets kept in history, legends of himself becomes a cowboy story, exaggerated but he's amused, secretly really love it)

#### draft notes

Dean/Cas don't actually spend another year of ranch life in the past, but Dean does think/imagine that life and find himself doesn't mind it (contrast with beginning when he has to stay but he finds it unbearable), even look forward to it (but it seems to only exist in parallel world now)

When Sam jokingly says "What took you so long", Dean jokingly replies "Spent a year in a ranch after you're gone", Sam believes and startles, Dean: "I wish." (write in a way to make it not clear whether it's true?)
