## Main

### Act 1 (Dean stuck in Sunrise)(Sunrise, 1861, Dean&Sam)

> **Outline:** Dean&Sam gets phoenix's ash by noon, bell rings, but Cas doesn't come, they can't get back. Some more time passes, they realize something must have happened to Cas and now they get stuck in the Frontierland and have to figure out what to do. They start living like the locals, blend in as cowboys, get used to it, Dean is the town sheriff.

Eyes unblinking, gun raised, not for a split second Dean thinks he might be too slow. Then the gunshot sound echoes, the phoenix burns with bright golden light and turns into a pile of ashes.

He still gets this. Dean beams to himself.

The clock bells the tone of high noon. Sound shaking him out of the mist of contentment.

"Dean! The ashes!" Sam yells behind him, following by several steps.

Dean dashes to the ashes, glass bottle ready in head, tip opened. The ashes fill into the bottle before the minute ends.

He lets out a breathe, regarding the glassful of ashes, shaking the bottle slightly, closes the lid. Right on time. Mission complete.

The minute passes. No stir in the air.

Dean glances back at Sam, both frowning.

The hands on the wall clock are ticking.

"Where's Cas?" Sam voices the question in his mind, hesitant, uneasy.

Dean gives him a tight smile, checking the clock again. Five minutes passed. "Dude might be busy," he says. "Give him another minute."

Castiel does not show up in the next minute, or the next five. Or ten.

Dean starts pacing, looking at the sky, half praying half just speaking to the empty air in front of him. "Hey Cas? Forget to check the watch or something? Time to pick us up."

He looks around. The town is still the western town they spent the last twenty four hours in, Sunrise, Wyoming. Not Bobby's place, definitely not Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Something is not right.

"Dean," Sam says slowly, pointing out the obvious. "Cas's never late for anything."

"He has wings, he can literally fly to any time anywhere, 'cause he'd never be late for anything." Dean says, staring at the clock with even more attention than he had with the phoenix during the duel.

"Then why do you think...?" Sam doesn't have to finish his sentence.

"I don't know." Dean forces out a breath, pushing down the uneasiness in his gut. "Let's just wait inside. Maybe he'll come just in a bit."

<br>

They sit by the sticky bar table in the Saloon. Elkins pours them each a glass of beer -- still tasting like horse piss but Dean manages to let it slide down the throat. If he has to stay here longer, might as well start getting used to it.

"You boys alright?" Elkins eyes them while cleaning a glass with a piece of brown yellow clothes god knows has been used for how long.

Dean swallows the liquid. "Yeah, yeah," he says, forcing a smile. "Just waiting for a friend to come by."

"Someone late for the date night?" the bartender reads his face, half joking.

"You can say that." Dean's too lazy to retort.

<br>

The saloon has some bar food too, they use them as the dinner.

The night soon falls on them. There is still no sign of Cas.

"You want to, umm," Sam shifts in the bar stool next to him. "Find a place for the night?"

Dean checks the watch. It's been ten hours.

He empties the glass and stands up. "Yeah ok, let's go."

There is no motel or anything similar in the town, of course -- apparently they don't get many outsiders. But the sheriff's office is empty. With both the sheriff and the deputy down, that place is just a whole big empty room waiting to be claimed.

Dean leads them back in there. The deputy's charred skeleton is still behind the bar, the air burnt flesh. Dean decides to not think about that for now. He wanders around the place, looking for anything available to claim for their use.

"You seem to fit the place well enough." Sam observes.

Dean gives him a look, fingering the sheriff's pin on his shirt. "You kidding me? I'm officially the sheriff in town, so yeah, this is legitimately my place now, 'course I fit in here."

"Not just in here," Sam amends the comment. "Everything, the shirt, the duel, the horse. People might actually buy in that you're from this time."

Slow understanding starts kicking in. Dean looks up from the lost-and-found bucket he's been scrounge, squinting, "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying," Sam pauses, looking him in the eyes, considering the words carefully. "We might have to stay here for quite some time, might as well blend in."

"No, no," Dean straightens up. "Cas is going to be here shortly. Maybe not tonight short, but tomorrow or something. He -- he won't keep us waiting for too long."

If he says it with enough confidence, he can convince himself too, isn't it?

"Then how long?" Sam pulls a mocking smile. "You don't even believe it yourself."

Dean breaks the gaze, impatient. "So what? You think Cas's gonna just dump us in here? In the middle of the wild, right on the edge of the Civil War?"

"Thought you'd like that," Sam says, easing around, grabbing a chair to sit down. "Isn't it your dream life? Since like six?"

Dean is muted for a second, frowning at him. "What? No! Yeah? I mean -- not like this!"

He trails off, giving their surrounding a quick look around. The bars, the officer's wooden desk, a couple chairs, the walls with peeling paper, some random jacket and whip or something scattering around. The air smells dust and horse.

"Not like this." He lands on it, going back to check the drawers under the desk. "Cas will come, I assure you. Just give him a bit time. He'll come. He always do."

"What if he can't? What if something happened to him, and he's... he's too weak to time travel, or even dead?"

"Don't say that!" Dean snaps, jerking his head from behind the desk, glaring at his brother. "Nothing's gonna happen to him, alright? Dude gets his full power back, new and improved, and he's leading a full army Upstairs! Must be just in the middle of war prepping meeting or something." He glances at the ceiling reflectively, as if he can see the Upstairs like that.

"I'm just being realistic," Sam says in a calm but worried voice. "Why else would he be late? We both know he's in a war and Raphael is on his tail. And we have no idea how bad the things are with his war, I mean, not really. That lieutenant angel, Rachel or something? Says they're in a bad position, isn't it? We didn't even ask how bad."

"Cas is fine." That's all Dean can think of to say. He swallows, closing the eyes for a second and reopening. He doesn't know that, but that's the only thing he can say. Only thing he has to hold on to. "He survives so many apocalypses before, surely Raphael can't be worse than Lucifer, right?"

He didn't mean to bring up the Lucifer thing, that time no more than a year ago when Cas was face to face with *both* Michael and Lucifer, right before he got exploded by the Devil. He flinches, the power of archangel has always been just an expression in his mind that he doesn't give much thought to, but what if...

He shakes his head, dragging himself away from that train of thought. "We don't know anything, so let's not freak ourselves out just by thinking about the worst, eh? Now, move your ass over here and help me find if there's some blanket or something around for the night."

<br>

"You boys still hanging around?" Elkins gives them a nod while serving some other town folks. "Thought you'd move on by now."

"Believe me, we want to, but eh.. still waiting for the ride." Dean gives him one of those convincing smiles he has perfected over the years with the case victims and authorities.

"There are a few spare horses around here if it's a ride you want." The bartender offers, being as kindly as any old western man can be.

"Uh, we actually..." Sam starts.

"You know what, that would be awesome." Dean cuts him off, smiling brightly at the old man.

They use the gold they bring along to pay off the food and drink. Not getting any suspicious look.

"I'd give this one to Bobby." Dean murmurs under breath when they walk out of the saloon. "Era of no plastic but all gold, I wouldn't know what to do if we don't have those."

The bag of gold is still heavy on his shoulder. The weight of wealth and reassurance.

Sam scoffs. "No credit card fraud or pooling this time."

Dean looks back over his shoulder, eyes sprinkling with cunning joy. "Ha, but there's still poker. You never know what skill could come handy or even save our ass some time a hundred fifty years in the past, don't you, Sammy?"

Sam shakes his head, laughing.

<br>

The horses Elkins pointed to them belonged to the passed Judge and old Sheriff. One beautiful black horse with furs so bright and smooth it almost reminds him of the Impala.

"Hey baby," Dean strokes its back, voice gentle, love flowing from his eyes, "you miss me?"

"Dean, I don't think she'd ever known you." Sam snorts.

Dean gives him a stern look, "You don't know that." He shifts the attention back to the beauty, its muscle strong and warm under his palm. "We might have met in our previous lives or something. Tell me she's not exactly like Baby to you?"

Sam tilts his head, regarding the horse, tip of his lips twists. "Hmm." he has to agree.

The other tan brown horse with a white stripe on the nose decides to throw its temper at Sam for a few moments when he approaches, but eventually lets him tie the saddle on and pats on the back.

<br>

They don't really have anywhere in mind to go, with the horses. But they are still over delighted to have them. Dean, especially.

A few days later, when he's grooming the Baby -- of course he has to name it after the real Baby -- Sam tells him, chuckling, "You have any idea how much it's like watching you wash the car?"

Dean doesn't look back from his busy work by hand, "I don't know, Sam, just the me in the other life, I guess."

Sam's chuckle stops. The silence makes Dean glance back.

"What?" he asks, slowing down the handwork.

"I didn't even realize how settled in we already are, like we're actually already in another life." Sam frowns. "Almost forget to count how many days it's been, since..."

"Since March the fifth," Dean says for him. "Since the day the phoenix died and Cas was supposed to meet us up, yeah I remember. Kinda hard to forget, isn't it?"

The glass bottle of phoenix ash is still tucked under his jacket, just in case if he has to be pulled away in a hurry, he'd make sure the reason why they're here in the first place wouldn't get lost.

Sam swallows, giving Dean a quick glance, a little sheepishly, "So is it time we finally start talking about what to do if Cas never come, if he just can't, and we might have to figure out our own way back?"

Dean stares at him, face grim, brows knitted tight. Eventually he sighs, giving in the stare, licking his lips. "Ok, yeah, you might be right. Can't put all the burden on the man, he might even need our help back home."

### Act 2-1 (Cas wake up) (Bobby's, 2011, Bobby&Cas)

> **Outline:** Cas passes out for longer than in canon, when he comes to it's past 24h and he's super weak and wounded. He doesn't want to risk Bobby's soul and can't leave the boys behind, but also like he mentioned, now they are lost to him, so he'd have to fight hard in the time flux to find them.

Bobby paces the living room, a few steps in front of the sofa where a bleeding out angel passed out.

"Balls." It might be the hundredth or thousandth time he curses. He doesn't bother counting.

The countdown on the clock is running out fast. Cas doesn't show any sign of waking up.

Bobby frowns deep, throwing looks between the clock and Cas every second.

Cas crashed into the kitchen little more than three hours ago, leaving a bloody sigil on the fridge door, and practically went straight into the coma. No explanation.

"Balls." Bobby curses under his breath again, staring at the unconscious angels.

The timer soon hits zero. The boys would be waiting in the goddamn wild west a hundred fifty years in the past, the only angel in the room is not waking up. Both waiting for him to save the day, what's he gonna do, wrapping a wing that's never there?

"Ok Cas, don't smite me or anything," Bobby approaches the sofa carefully, thinking twice, then shaking Cas's shoulder. First not so much harshly, then a lot more. But still, the eyes are closed, the cut on his abdomen is bleeding some ominous bright light.

Bobby slaps his face -- also lightly first, all things considered, then a lot less so. But nothing works.

Bobby runs out of idea.

"Balls" is not enough for him given the circumstance. He'd need a stronger word.

<br>

There might be a spell or something useful in the books. Bobby jumps back into the familiar realm, diving into the lore and magic, looking for something that may remotely give some hope, of either bringing the boys home by himself or waking up the angel.

He did wrap a bandage on Cas's abdomen, trying vainly to stop the angelic bleeding. Not gonna do anything to the celestial creature in his true form, sure, Bobby figured that, but maybe healing the vessel might just help him recover a little bit faster? With nothing by hand, all he can do is hope.

And pray.

He has to pray for all of them now. But if not to Cas, to whom?

Glancing at the bloody sigil with Cas's fingerprint that is visibly gradually drying out, it can be a big mistake. Bobby downs a glass of whiskey before doing that.

"Well, call me stupid but none of you here stopping me, so here goes nothing." Bobby looks up at the ceiling.

"Whatever angel out there," he says, grumpily, can't decide whether to keep the eyes open or shut, settled with squinting, "uh, hope you're on our side. Could use a little help here."

The sigil on the fridge door brightens up, burning into a bright golden color, similar to the leaking light from inside Cas, then dying out slowly. It might look a little shallower than before, Bobby observes, not knowing what it means.

No angel shows up. Not sure if it's good or bad news.

Bobby turns back to the books for help.

<br>

Bobby doesn't close his eyes in the first night. The letters on the pages start swimming.

Castiel is still not responding to anything. Face pale, body cold.

Bobby examines his wound -- while murmuring "I don't have a goddamn PhD in angelic medics, just so you know" -- the cut is still deep, the leaking light is blinding, but Bobby decides it's not as blinding as yesterday. Not sure if it's hopeful thinking or his eyes are just getting adjusted to angel grace.

He sighs long and deep. "Should have talked them out of this, told you it's a bad idea, but who'd listen?"

The next day passes in the book and regular check with the angel. So is the day after.

Bobby is getting increasingly desperate. "Never thought I'd lose the boys like this, in a time even before they're born."

He slams Castiel's collar, shaking him a lot more violently. "You gotta wake up, Cas." his voice practically pleading. "Dean's waiting for you! Sam's waiting for you!"

Cas lets out a pained groan.

Bobby puts him down. "Cas?"

Castiel wakes up a few more hours later, exhaling sharply. Eyes opening slowly, staring straight into the space in front of him, blank, then onto Bobby's screwed face, confused.

He frowns deep, trying to pull himself up from the sofa but wobbly so much that he crashes back down the minute he puts the weight on the legs.

"There he is." Bobby breathes out, not exactly relieved but at least lighter than the past seventy something hours. He lends a hand to help Cas balance. "What happened?"

Castiel gets rid of the bandage, palm covering the wound. The light is still leaking from between his fingers. He tells him, "I was, uh... I was attacked, betrayed by one of our own."

"Should see the other guy, right?" Bobby tries putting a light tone there.

Castiel probably doesn't get the reference, he answers anyway. "Rachel, she was killed. But I was wounded. Need to use some safety, so... thank you."

"You mean that finger painting?" Bobby eyes the sigil that he has stared for so many times over the past few day. It's barely visible now. Only a light bloody stain, smudged.

Cas follows his eyes, frowning deeper. "Is there any other angels coming around this place while I was out?" he glares at Bobby.

Bobby shrugs. "Not that I know of."

Cas looks into him, saying gravely. "Did you... pray to them?"

Bobby tilts his head, having a bad feeling but has to defend himself. "Well, you're out, boys need a ride home, what else was I supposed to do? So yeah, distress call."

Cas looks like he was about to snap, but decides at the last minute to turn it into a sigh. "You might just put both of us in extreme danger, me, especially. Since Raphael might already hear it and find where I am, or at least close enough. I could be dead any minute by now if it's not still shielding me."

Defeated, Bobby steps back half a step, giving Cas some space as he tries to give another attempt to stand up. "Well, I'm sorry. I guess. Was really out of option there."

"How long was I unconscious?" Cas leaves the sofa, walking shakily toward the desk.

"Three days, give or take." Bobby answers, without having to check the time. "Now would really be a good time to bring the boys home. Should have enough fun in the Frontierland by now."

"I can't." Cas drops his head, facing away from Bobby.

"Come again?"

"The fight... it drained me." Cas shifts his feet. Uneasy. "And it's been too long. They're lost to me already."

Bobby scowls at his back, snapping. "Then found them! You can't just leave Sam and Dean in the past like that!"

"I know." Castiel turns back, looking at Bobby in the eyes, solemnly. Determined. "So I'll still go, and try my best, but I don't know what's the chance. If I don't make it back..." he breaks the gaze, "please know that I'm truly sorry and I mean it."

With that, and a disturbance of wind flow in the room, Castiel is gone.

"What the--" Bobby takes two steps ahead, right next to where the angel was, but it is so clear there is nothing left there anymore.

### Act 2-2 (Dean leave Sunrise)(Sunrise, 1861, Dean&Sam)

> **Outline:** Dean prays to Cas but doesn't get answer, they figure Cas said they're lost to him, so their idea is to do something "noisy" (big enough to get some notice from the future but not too big to disturb the history) so that their existence might be like some beacon in the timeline, hopefully making it easier for Cas to locate them.

"Get out of my house." Samuel Colt grumbles, without bothering lifting his head. His colt on the desk by his hand -- a normal one, not the special one he'd already given to them.

"I'm really sorry to bother you again," Sam steps gingerly ahead, Dean follows him a few feet behind. "I wouldn't bother you if it's not absolute urgent."

"Thought I already did my share of help." he eyes them. "Don't tell me the Colt didn't work on the creature you're hunting."

"No, it's not that." Dean chimes in, "It worked, but uh... it's something else we can use a little help there."

"Which part of I'm retired failed you?"

Samuel is clearly not an easy one to approach, Dean decides.

"Like I said, in our time, you're sort of a really big deal, a famous hunter-- " Sam manages a tight smile, as friendly as he can pull.

"Heard you the first time."

"So we figure you'd be the best supernatural researcher around here too." Dean pulls an puffery grin.

"Please, we are not asking you to hunt with us or anything," Sam continues. "Just need a little help in research."

<br>

It turns out their guess isn't too far off. Samuel has as big of a book collection as Bobby's or Campbell's, right downstairs in the place where a cellar should be, but with tons more additional traps and sigils painted on every inch of floor and wall.

Panic room *and* library, nice. Classic. Dean looks around, thinking how *fun* it must be to be able to spending all the time reading while hiding out here.

Sam nudges him, eyeing the rows of books. He nods back.

Research time.

<br>

"Don't you think if there's a way to pull it off here and now, someone would have done that?" Dean puts a book after god knows how many hours, wiping his face by his hands, giving his brain some break. "Then why didn't we ever run into people time-traveled from the past all the time?"

Sam doesn't move his eyes away from whatever he's scanning. "They don't know what we know." he says.

But they don't know much about this time thing, either. Dean thinks. It's always just Cas swinging them around, or some other douchebag angels occasionally. Just popping in and out, not really much theory or science to learn about.

Should probably have asked a few more questions about how time flux thing works. He realizes belatedly. But after all, not everyone is as nerdy as Sam.

"I just remember Cas said once that time travel isn't easy but not impossible," Dean thinks hard, poking some piece of old memory, the time when he met mom and dad when they were younger than his age, the other time when they were trying to stop the yellow-eyed demon but still failed utterly, even the time when he got flipped to the messed-up five years into the zombie land future that turns out never would come. What did Cas tell him during those short talks?

"He said that time is fluid, it's not easy, but apparently the angels have no problem bending it once in a while."

Sam jerks his head up, eyes bright with understanding, "And he also told us this time before we left, that the further back he sent us, the harder it becomes to retrieve us, that's why he said we can't stay for more than 24 hours, or we'd be lost to him."

"Which means we are totally lost to him by now and no way home without the wings." Dean says bitterly.

"No, Dean!" Sam jumps to his feet, excited. "I think that's exactly our solution! This book here also said something similar, quite many are saying the same thing actually, I just didn't realize they might be literal, thought it's more metaphorical."

He slides the book over with some illustration of river on it, "Imagine the time is like river or something, fluid, rapid turbulence flow of some kind, and each of us is like a floating leaf. Cas can bend the waterway so it becomes non-chronological, the downstream touches the upstream, that's how we land here. And folding some part off would be to fast-forward into the future. But if we stay here for too long, we are like the leaves washed away by the flow by too far, that's probably why he can't find us, because he doesn't know where we are in the time flux anymore."

Dean's brows tie into a knot. "So... what's our way out again?"

"We just need to make some *noise*, like splashes on the surface by fish jumping out of the water, making us stand out in the timeline so he can find us, sending out some temporal beacons -- assuming he's out there looking for us." Sam's voice gets quieter at the last clause.

"He's out there." Dean nods firmly, almost reflexively.

"Ok." he considers again, starting a minor smile. "Sounds like a plan to me. What kind of noise are we talking about?"

Sam looks a little caught up by the question, shrugging unsurely. "What do I know? Something big enough to get some notice for us in the future, I'd guess? I would definitely notice if your face show up in some old western posters, guess you can finally make a name for yourself in this era like you always wanted, huh?"

Sam throws a half smile in his brother's direction, knowing him too well.

Dean's eyes glints. "Any catch I need to know before messing up the time?"

Tip of Sam's mouth twitches. "Just like you said but... don't mess up the time too much?"

Dean returns the look. "Let me, umm, just try one more time, just to be sure."

Glancing up, he prays hard and loud, "Cas, if you have your ears on, come pick us up here, March the twelfth, Sunrise, Wyoming, alright? Or we're gonna do something that *possibly* could break the history, you hear me?"

He waits. One second. Two seconds. Three seconds. No stir of air, no wings, no feathered angel. No Cas.

Dean breathes out. "Ok then, let's do this."

<br>

"So you boys finally decide to move on now?" Elkins eyes their looks.

Dean has a red bandana wrapped around his mouth, Sam has a black one. They change into new shirts and pants -- new for them, old by the look of the clothes, dirt and stain make them look exactly like the rest of the folks in the saloon.

The look of pilgrim, Dean realizes.

He doesn't nod or shake. Just charges directly into the room, going straight to the bartender that they've grown familiar with by each day. Dean lets out a breath. Tastes a tad of bitterness on the tip of his tongue.

Drawing the pistol out of the holster by his waist in a smooth swing, he fires towards the ceiling three times. Some girl screams behind him, he knows Sam must also have his gun drew out, pointing somewhere.

Elkins looks at him, reaching for something underneath the bar stand. Supposedly a shotgun.

"I wouldn't suggest that." Dean points the gun at him. The bartender stops moving, raising the hands.

"What's that about?" The old man is still surprisingly calm, not even showing enough of curiosity.

How many of these kinds of gangsters has he seen before, Dean finds himself wondering.

"What every mobster around here wants," he says, aiming for a deep, grave voice. "You got any hidden treasure around here? Otherwise gold would do too."

"At least leave me a name to pass your story?" Elkins reaches for the side drawer. The gold he offers include some of those they paid in the past few days for their food. Dean has to push down the uneasiness.

"Eastwood, Clint Eastwood. Best gunner in the western world." Dean tells him.

"We'll see about that." Three gunshots are released at almost the same second. Dean dives behind an overturned dining table. A bullet barely misses his cheek.

"Son of a bitch!" He shouts out. Dirt on the ground flies into air, the room is hazy for a second. He can't see much.

"Sam!" Dean looks left and right, trying to figure out what now.

"I'm ok!" Sam yells back, somewhere behind him, probably using a different table as shelter.

"What the hell?" he thinks out loud. The first robbery probably isn't always very successful even for western gangsters, is it?

"Well, Hell sends regards." Elkins's steps are right in front of the table. Dean risks a glimpse, catching the sight of black eyes.

"Demon!" He warns Sam, at the same time of ducking into a gap between the stools, exactly when the desk he was hiding behind gets shot a gun hole around the place where his heart would have been.

"Where are they coming from?" Sam moves closer to him, looking at a different direction.

"They?" Dean alerts.

"The ladies at the back." Sam rushes the explanation. "Darla and at least two others, already counting four here."

Even with the Colt they haven't really had won any advantage with that many demons all at once, and god knows how many more might crawling in as they speak.

"Surprised to see us?" Elkins's voice sounds harsh and edgy, nothing like what he sounded like when he spoke with them in the past. "We kill everyone close to Samuel Colt, just so you know."

"Huh, usually the other way around," Dean amuses. "So this is how it's like to have someone more famous than us around."

Sam spares him a glare, "Not funny, Dean! And not the time!"

"Right," Dean tightens the grip on the pistol, counting the number of bullets he has left in the heart, "a little low on ammo here, any idea?"

Sam shares a look with him while nodding at the exit door. Dean gives him a thumb up, finger drawing a circle and then pointing at himself. Sam nods in understanding.

From the sound of their surrounding footsteps, demons are circling closer.

"Bullet can kill us but we can't kill you, a little unfair, isn't it?" Dean raises his voice from behind the hideout. Tone teasing.

The demon possessing the bartender lets out a raspy laughter. "You will die, Clint Eastwood."

"Huh, it's actually nice hearing people say that, you know. Leaving the name behind is sorta the point." Dean estimates the timing and the distance, swinging a stool at the foot of the closest demon girl, diving side way. Darla, the saloon girl cornered him the first day, yells angrily, eyes turning black.

"Sorry about that." Dean says, apologetically. Then, "Sam! Now!"

A bucket rolls towards him, soaked inside out with alcohol. Dean jumps out of the place, right before firing at the bucket, turning the whole place into a big pile of flame and smoke. Demons hiss furiously inside.

The two boys unleash the horses by the stable, galloping out of the town, heading west.

<br>

They don't slow down until the burning hut is completely out of view. The sun is setting ahead of them on the horizon. They ease the rein, letting the horses stroll.

Dean glances back at the wild plain territory behind them, barely anything to see. Barren and wild, no sign of civilization.

"Guess no coming back to Sunrise, Wyoming now." He sighs, patting at the duffel bag and roll of bedding wrapped tightly on the back of the horse, letting out a long breath. "Didn't expect the first gig would end up like that."

"The robbing part or the demon part?" Sam eyes him sideways.

Dean considers, almost laughing, "You know what, the worst part is I don't know which is worse. But do you think it's big enough of a stress signal to Cas now?"

Sam looks up at the sky. The night is falling, the stars are incredibly bright on these lands. Pure universe hanging on top of them like a gigantic globe hull, celestial, but not in a biblical way. "Probably not." he murmurs.

"Yeah." Dean has to agree, them not being home already is proof by itself. "Come on then, let's head west and make some more noise, he'd have to hear one of them. Good thing all the land between here and sea are free to go."

The whole wild west ahead of them, free to explore.

But Dean isn't anywhere near ecstasy. It's just too damn far away from home.

### Act 2-3 (Cas time travel)(Time flux, Cas&Raphael)

> **Outline:** Cas's in no condition to time travel but he worries about Dean too much so he risks flying into the time flux in his wounded state, leaving bloody trace behind. His trace exposes him, Raphael follows him into the time flux, so he has to escape the chase while tries to locate Dean, Cas crash lands in Sunrise Wyoming but Dean's not there.

"This is stupid, even for you." The thundering voice sounds up above him. Cas doesn't need to look up to know who has found him.

The stab pierces through the abdomen of the vessel, but even worse for his true form. The outer ring gets a deep cut through, almost reaching the middle ring. The root of one of the right wings is also wounded. He can barely fly straight.

It's like leaving blood trace behind in the open sea, he thinks remotely. He's the drowning swimmer, attracting the sharks.

"Thought I can at least have a head start before you catch up." Cas answers. Beating his wings the hardest he can. The pain tears through his wings with each slap. But he has to keep going.

Below them, the time flux is flowing, bright and sparkling. Almost like flying in the space, appreciating the galaxy. In a way, time is no different from space.

"So you know I'd found you, sooner or later." Raphael amuses. The flow from the archangel's wings disturbs this time dimension like a tornado sweeping through wild plain. "I didn't know you're the suicidal type."

"Not suicidal." Cas dives lower, avoiding the central turbulence, trying to use the left wings to remedy the wounds on the right side. He doesn't bother checking if the bleeding of grace is getting worse. The bondage Bobby helped wrapping him with didn't do anything. His essence is running out fast.

He's running out of time too.

It's actually funny. Cas's mind somehow wanders away. If Dean is here, he'd definitely make a remark about how you can even running out of time when you're literally *in* the time dimension, scouting the time flux.

He can't think of any joke himself.

Not suicidal, but just for finding the brothers. He just need enough time to find them before Raphael gets a hold of him, and undoubtfully smiting him.

The time flux has an urgent turn around nineteenth century, with the Civil War and everything, the history is not so easy to make out. Cas squints his eyes, focusing on the reflections in the time flux --

That's when he loses his balance suddenly. A harsh tear on tip of his top left wing makes him gasp in pain, the inner ring shrinks in reflex, like how a human would yell and jump back at an unexpected strike of pain.

Cas curls his left wings for self-protection, dropping the flying height. Raphael's big shadow swooping right on top of him, like an eagle diving for its prey sparrow.

He manages a sharp turn avoiding the attack. The tip of the lower wings dipping into the time flux, catching a damp from the early twentieth century.

Cas resets his rings and wings, swirling backwards.

"You do know it is pointless to fight or hide from me, do you?" Raphael mocks, turning around as well, following him two wings' distance away.

"How do you find me?" Cas asks, hoping vainly that this might distract the archangel for at least a split of heartbeat time, while widening all his eyes scattered on his rings to scan through the time flux while he flies. It's been a while since he has to fight in the time dimension in his true form, even longer to have to find a soul in here, if ever.

But surely the familiarity and the profound bound should make it slight easier? Cas starts getting anxious, finding the time flux all look the same and more confusingly dazzling than he remembers. Something is going on in these western times, but he doesn't know what if he's not there, but Dean is there, going through the weird time and history on his own, without wing and without protection.

Cas flaps his wings more rapidly, bearing all the tearing feeling in the rings and wings. Not caring the more rapid speed the grace is losing, spilling from his true form like dripping blood along the way.

Then for the second time, the disturbance in the air hits him sharp from the center, he almost falls directly into the time flux below.

The archangel didn't even unleash his supernova-explosion-level grace, just using the tip of his wings that are as sharp as any metal in the universe that can ever be, almost cutting him in half.

Castiel screams in pain in his true voice. The time dimension echoes his sound. Raphael laughs behind him in satisfaction.

"I can smell your bleeding grace from two galaxies away, Castiel." Raphael tells him, the satisfying tone is still there. "Let alone that human you hang out with, Bobby gave us a loud and clear coordinate. So give up, Castiel, you can't hide from me in any time or space. I will always find you, and I will always destroy you."

The second swing of cutting comes from the other side, Cas hears it coming before it hits him, he ducks sideways. The archangel's feathers are like natural angel blade, it scratches his innermost ring, missing the heart of his essence by mere inches.

He could be killed any minute now. Cas thinks bitterly. And then Dean and Sam would be trapped in the western wasteland in the past, forever. They won't even reach the time when the first Impala was ever produced when they die of old age -- if they die of old age. They won't ever come back home again.

Cas blinks his eyes hard, opening all his wings again, wounded or not, shooting upwards. Directly into Raphael from below. The rings around his essence rotate fast and urgent, like a rapidly beating heart.

Raphael doesn't expect the change of direction in his moves. He has no time of diverting.

Cas uses his whole existence as bullet, the momentum as the fuel, hitting Raphael in his most vulnerable ring -- the same part where Cas is beating and rotating glaringly, the innermost ring around the essence. Raphael is pushed out of balance, for a split of heartbeat, out of control of where he's heading.

Castiel catches the blink of opportunity when Raphael is not looking at him, diving straight into the time flux below him.

The time dimension swirls and spins around him, sucking him into the point he chooses. The speed of rotation makes his rings twist and deform. No wonder every time he pops Dean in and out, he'd complain about motion sickness. This must be the exactly dizziness a human would feel if he doesn't have any grace left.

The thought makes his heart thumps hard.

Did he lose all the grace just coming for them? How's he gonna take the boys home now?

Disregardless of still answerless to any of his questions, his feet land on the solid ground again. Castiel tumbles ahead, dropping on his all fours, spitting blood onto the sandy ground in front of him. The view is swimming, the ground is  floating up and down as if he's being washed away by the tide. He has to focus very hard to not let the cold, shaky limbs give way here and now.

Wind blows, the sand rises around him. The vessel coughs, more blood dripping, not just from his mouth.

Cas only gets time to see the wooden sign saying "Sunrise, WYO." before the world turns total black.

### Act 3

> **Outline:** They leave Sunrise Wyoming (cuz demons find them), Dean quits sheriff, the two boys ride horses, wear bandana, wrap blanket, "roadtrip in wild west" (as the art show). They play cards in inns, provoke gun fights and win, occasionally deliberately act like bandits and rob gold mine owners, distribute gold to other poorer people, gets a fame of western Robin Hood and best gunner for themselves. (Dean pray to Cas every night)

### Act 4

> **Outline:** Cas is too wounded to fly again and can't risk using his power in case he gets noticed by Raphael (still scouting in time flux), so he lives in the town like a human, also tries his best to blend in. After a while when he recovers slightly, he asks around if anyone has seen the brothers based on his description but no one does. The town looks relatively new, not so crappy, he asks time and realizes why. To stay in the town for longer and not raise suspicion, Cas starts working in a ranch just to continue pretending to be a normal human. Cas is still weak and low in power, but as time goes by, he's growing back.

### Act 5

> **Outline:** Dean & Sam go back to Sunrise Wyoming, get jump attacked by a stranger, very obviously trying to kill them and very good at fighting, and after a few rounds they realize he's not human. It's Castiel, the original 1860s timeline version, receives order that they're disturbing the timeline and comes to eliminate them (Castiel: "You pray too loud. I really don't know why you act like we are familiar" Dean: "I almost forget how big of an asshole you were before"). Dean almost gets killed, prays desperately instinctively again to his Cas, and gets saved when this Castiel gets blown away by power. His Cas is there, cowboy looking, dirty from ranch work, totally blend in and human-like, faceful of "I finally found you".
>
> Dean: "Where have you been?" Cas: "When." Dean: "Wh-- how long have you been here?" Cas: "Twenty years. I landed too early, so I have to wait for you to catch up, wait for time to pass in the slow old way." Dean: "I prayed to you." Cas: "I know." He can hear all the time but can't get to Dean.
>
> Cas flies them home, back to the same day they leave for the phoenix's ashes. Bobby is still there, exactly the same as before, everything the same. (Or not exactly, Dean's western fame gets kept in history, legends of himself becomes a cowboy story, exaggerated but he's amused)
