**Summary:**

The plan was simple -- get the phoenix's ashes and get out. But when do things ever go easy for them? High noon comes and goes, and Dean finds himself stranded in the Wild West with no way home -- and no sign of Cas.

Castiel fights hard. Time is fluid and never easy to navigate, especially with his grace bleeding out and an archangel on his tail. The sign of Sunrise, Wyoming is finally in sight, but Dean is not here.

The past is vast, the clock is slow -- they're taking the long way home.

**Preview Snippet:**

"So, you boys finally decided to move on?" Elkins eyes their looks.

Dean has a red bandana wrapped around his mouth, Sam a black one. They've changed into new shirts and pants -- new for them, old for the clothes -- dirt and stains making them look exactly like the rest of the folks in the place.

The look of a pilgrim, Dean realizes.

He doesn't nod or shake. Just strides straight into the room, heading directly for the bartender they've grown familiar with over the past few days. Dean lets out a breath, tasting a tad of bitterness lingering on the tip of his tongue.

Drawing the pistol from the holster at his waist in a smooth swing, he fires three shots into the ceiling. Some girls scream behind him, he knows Sam must also have his gun drawn, aimed somewhere.

Elkins looks at him, reaching for something underneath the bar stand. Supposedly a shotgun.

"I wouldn't suggest that." Dean shifts his aim toward him. The bartender stops moving, hands slowly rising.

"What's this about?" The old man is still surprisingly calm, not even showing much curiosity.

Just how many gangsters has he run into before? Dean finds himself wondering.

"What every outlaw around here wants," he says, aiming for a deep, grave voice. "You got any hidden treasure around here? Gold would do too."

"At least leave me a name to pass your story along?" Elkins reaches for a side drawer. The gold he offers includes some of the very pieces they paid for their meals over the past few days. Dean has to push down the unease.

"Eastwood. Clint Eastwood. Best gunner in the western world," Dean tells him.

### Loophole fix

If Cas is already in Sunrise Wyoming on 1861.3.5, then why he isn't there when Dean prays for him?

(time travel loophole -> learn from HP3 to fix)

Cas POV: Cas backtracks to 20y ago, lives and waits, then 1861.3.5 comes, Cas arrives in saloon earlier than Dean, witnesses Sheriff burned by the phoenix Elias Finch, hiding to prevent paradox, jump attacked & trapped by demons (the one possess Elkins), so can't get to Dean until the day he burns the place down, Cas free but Dean already rides away, Cas try chase him around but can't catch up, find Dean become wanted, join posse to follow him (also persuade people don't shoot him), Dean runaway from posse, until Dean confronted by 1861!Cas, Cas catch up, fight/blast the old self away, use power to heal Dean (wounded by 1861!Cas), low energy again; can't carry both, fly Sam back first, spit blood when fly back to Dean, collapsed, the two stay in ranch waiting for Cas recover (a bit domestic life), 1y later Cas fly them back to the same day

Dean POV: Cas doesn't come after they pray, start messing around making noise, attacked by demon possessed Elkins, burn place down, leave Sunrise Wyoming; help saloon lady from unjust verdict (bounty hunter, "Unforgiven"), rob bank & train ("Butch Sundance"), chased by railway company posse, start running, so never meet Cas; cornered by posse one night, desperately pray to Castiel, 1861!Cas comes, align with Cas POV afterwards

Sam POV: follow Dean around, Cas fly him back first, Dean&Cas follow immediately, thought it's the same moment, but actually time passed for them a lot longer

(the time they're apart -> fast-forward quickly, a quick sketch, only mention what happened in a series of montage (newspaper clips), tell each other once they met again)

### Wild west road trip cases

states to go: Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, California

some town names:

- Redstone Crossing, Wyoming
- Thunderhill, Colorado
- Pinecrest, Utah
- Deadwood, Arizona
- Rattlesnake Bend, Nevada
- Cattle Creek, Kansas
- Silver Gulch, California

### Edit note

~~keep Sam out of picture from beginning, only Dean travel alone and make noise, Sam stay at Samuel's place all the time~~

~~passing line: Dean hates he can't use cellphone, really want to have a call to make sure people he care about are safe~~ (give the line to Cas)

Chap.7: Major rewrites, don't like it, too emotionally remote and abrupt, and spoil the future events → pretend only knows so far until S06E18, but give hopeful ending that *maybe* when all is done, that's the thing they can have, in the end

(phrasing) saloon girls: "with practiced cheer"

Add an epilogue? follow-up of Butch Sundance, potential change to the movie? a passing line that mentioned "Eastwood"? Butch's POV? destiel's movie night and that's how they find out? Dean finds his own sketch in the movie? follow-up of Little Bill? to show they didn't make much disturbance to the history but Dean did make a name for himself as cowboy and he liked it

## Main

### Chap.1-1 (Dean stuck in Sunrise)(Sunrise, 1861, Dean+Sam)

> **Outline:** Dean&Sam gets phoenix's ash by noon, bell rings, but Cas doesn't come, they can't get back. Some more time passes, they realize something must have happened to Cas and now they get stuck in the Frontierland and have to figure out what to do. They start living like the locals, blend in as cowboys, get used to it, Dean is the town sheriff.

Eyes unblinking, gun raised, not for a split second Dean thinks he might be too slow. Then the gunshot sound echoes, the phoenix burns with bright golden light and turns into a pile of ashes.

He still gets this. Dean beams to himself.

The clock bells the tone of high noon. Sound shaking him out of the mist of contentment.

"Dean! The ashes!" Sam yells behind him, following by several steps.

Dean dashes to the ashes, glass bottle ready in head, tip opened. The ashes fill into the bottle before the minute ends.

He lets out a breathe, regarding the glassful of ashes, shaking the bottle slightly, closes the lid. Right on time. Mission complete.

The minute passes. No stir in the air.

Dean glances back at Sam, both frowning.

The hands on the wall clock are ticking.

"Where's Cas?" Sam voices the question in his mind, hesitant, uneasy.

Dean gives him a tight smile, checking the clock again. Five minutes passed. "Dude might be busy," he says. "Give him another minute."

Castiel does not show up in the next minute, or the next five. Or ten.

Dean starts pacing, looking at the sky, half praying half just speaking to the empty air in front of him. "Hey Cas? Forget to check the watch or something? Time to pick us up."

He looks around. The town is still the western town they spent the last twenty four hours in, Sunrise, Wyoming. Not Bobby's place, definitely not Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Something is not right.

"Dean," Sam says slowly, pointing out the obvious. "Cas's never late for anything."

"He has wings, he can literally fly to any time anywhere, 'cause he'd never be late for anything." Dean says, staring at the clock with even more attention than he had with the phoenix during the duel, as if the solution is somehow hanging on the tip of one metal clock finger.

"Then why do you think...?" Sam doesn't have to finish his sentence.

"I don't know." Dean forces out a breath, pushing down the unease in his gut. "Let's just wait inside. Maybe he'll come just in a bit."

<br>

They sit by the sticky bar table in the Saloon. Elkins pours them each a glass of beer -- still tasting like horse piss but Dean manages to let it slide down the throat. If he has to stay here longer, might as well start getting used to it.

"You boys alright?" Elkins eyes them while cleaning a glass with a piece of brown yellow rag god knows has been used for how long.

Dean swallows the liquid. "Yeah, yeah," he says, forcing a smile. "Just waiting for a friend to come by."

"Someone late for the date night?" the bartender reads his face, half joking.

"You can say that." Dean's too lazy to retort.

<br>

The saloon has some bar food too, they use them as the dinner.

The night soon falls on them. There is still no sign of Cas.

"You want to, umm," Sam shifts in the stool next to him, "-- get a room for the night?" He nods at the wooden "Room" sign below the saloon's signboard.

Dean checks his watch. It's been ten hours.

He empties the glass and stands up. "Yeah ok, let's go." Then adds, "But not here."

"What's wrong with here?"

Dean's eyes sweep through the saloon girls gathering and giggling around the base of the staircase, sounds of cheap bed shaking are remotely audible. His eyes land back on Sam's, raising the eyebrows that can speak by themselves: *Serious?*

Sam hums. "Good point."

They go back to the sheriff's office. With both the sheriff and the deputy down, that place is just a whole big empty room waiting to be claimed.

Dean leads them back in there. The deputy's charred skeleton is still behind the bar, the air burnt flesh. Dean decides to not think about that for now. He wanders around the place, looking for anything available to claim for their use.

"You seem to fit the place well enough." Sam observes.

Dean gives him a look, fingering the sheriff's pin on his shirt. "You kidding me? I'm officially the sheriff in town, so yeah, this is legitimately my place now, 'course I fit in here."

"Not just in here," Sam supplements. "Everything, the shirt, the duel, the horse. People might actually buy in that you're from this time, which, of course, is a good thing."

Slow understanding starts kicking in. Dean looks up from the lost-and-found bucket he's been scrounge, squinting, "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying," Sam pauses, looking him in the eyes, considering the words carefully. "We might have to stay here for quite some time, might as well blend in."

"No, no," Dean straightens up. "Cas is going to be here shortly. Maybe not tonight short, but tomorrow or something. He -- he won't keep us waiting for too long."

If he says it with enough confidence, he can convince himself too, isn't it?

"Then how long?" Sam pulls a mocking smile. "You don't even believe it yourself."

Dean breaks the gaze, impatient. "So what? You think Cas's gonna just dump us in here? In the middle of the wild, right on the edge of the Civil War?"

"Thought you'd like that," Sam says, easing around, grabbing a chair to sit down. "Isn't it your dream life? Since like six?"

"What? No!" Sam raises an eyebrow. Dean is muted for a second, frowning at him. "Yeah? I mean -- not like this!"

He trails off, giving their surrounding a quick look around. The bars, the officer's wooden desk, a couple lousy chairs, the walls with peeling paper, some random jacket and whip or something scattering around. The air smells dust and horse.

"Not like this." He lands on it, going back to check the drawers under the desk. "Cas will come, I assure you. Just give him a bit time. He'll come. He always do."

"What if he can't? What if something happened to him, and he's... he's too weak to time travel, or even dead?"

"Don't say that!" Dean snaps, jerking his head up from behind the desk, glaring at his brother. "Nothing's gonna happen to him, alright? Dude gets his full power back, new and improved, and he's leading a full army Upstairs! Must be just in the middle of war prepping meeting or something." He glances at the ceiling reflexively, as if he can see the Heaven like that.

"I'm just being realistic," Sam says in a calm but worried voice. "Why else would he be late? We both know he's in a war and Raphael is on his tail. And we have no idea how bad the things are with his war, I mean, not really. That lieutenant angel, Rachel or something? Says they're in a bad position, isn't it? Balthazar said something similar before. We didn't even ask how bad."

"Cas is fine." That's all Dean can think of to say. He swallows, closing the eyes for a second and reopening. He doesn't know that, but that's the only thing he can say. Only thing he has to hold on to. "He survives so many apocalypses before, surely Raphael can't be worse than Lucifer, right?"

He doesn't mean to bring up the Lucifer thing, that time no more than a year ago when Cas was face to face with *both* Michael and Lucifer, right before he got exploded by the Devil. He flinches, the power of archangel has always been just an expression in his mind that he doesn't give much thought to, but what if...

He shakes his head, dragging himself away from that train of thought. "We don't know anything, so let's not freak ourselves out just by thinking about the worst, eh? Now, move your ass over here and help me find if there's some blanket or something around for the night."

<br>

"You boys still hanging around?" Elkins gives them a nod while serving some other town folks the next day. "Thought you'd move on by now."

"Believe me, we want to, but eh.. still waiting for the ride." Dean gives him one of those convincing smiles he has perfected over the years with the case victims and authorities.

"There are a few spare horses around here if it's a ride you want." The bartender offers, being as kindly as any old western man can be.

"Uh, we actually..." Sam starts.

"You know what, that would be awesome." Dean cuts him off, smiling brightly at the old man.

They use the gold they bring along to pay off the food and drink before heading out. Didn't get any suspicious look.

"I'd give this one to Bobby." Dean murmurs under breath when they walk out of the saloon. "Era of no plastic but all gold, I wouldn't know what to do if we don't have those."

The bag of gold is still heavy on his shoulder. The weight of wealth and reassurance.

Sam scoffs. "No credit card fraud or pooling this time."

Dean looks back over his shoulder, eyes sprinkling with cunning joy. "Ha, but there's still poker. You never know what skill could come handy or even save our ass some time a hundred fifty years in the past, don't you, Sammy?"

Sam shakes his head, laughing.

<br>

The horses Elkins pointed to them belong to the late Judge and old Sheriff. One beautiful black horse with furs so bright and smooth it almost reminds him of the Impala.

"Hey baby," Dean strokes its back, voice gentle, love flowing from his eyes, "you miss me?"

"Dean, I don't think she'd ever known you." Sam snorts.

Dean gives him a stern look, "You don't know that." He shifts the attention back to the beauty, its muscle strong and warm under his palm. "We might have met in our previous lives or something. Tell me she's not exactly like Baby to you?"

Sam tilts his head, regarding the horse, tip of his lips curls. "Hmm." he has to agree.

The other tan brown horse with a white stripe on the nose decides to throw its temper at Sam for a few moments when he approaches, but eventually lets him tie the saddle and pats on the back.

<br>

They don't really have anywhere in mind to go, with the horses. But they are still over delighted to have them. Dean, especially.

Days later, when he's grooming the Baby -- of course he has to name her after the real Baby -- Sam tells him, chuckling, "You have any idea how much it's like watching you wash the car?"

Dean doesn't look back from his busy work by hand, "I don't know, Sam, just the me in the other life, I guess."

Sam's chuckle stops. The silence makes Dean glance back.

"What?" he asks, slowing down the handwork.

"I didn't even realize how settled in we already are, like we're *actually* already in another life." Sam frowns. "Almost forget to count how many days it's been, since..."

"Since March the fifth," Dean says for him. "Since the day the phoenix died and Cas was supposed to meet us up, yeah I remember. Kinda hard to forget, don't you think?"

The glass bottle of phoenix ash is still tucked under his jacket, just in case if he has to be pulled away in a hurry, he'd make sure the reason why they're here in the first place wouldn't get lost.

Sam swallows, giving Dean a quick glance, a little sheepishly, "So is it time we finally start talking?"

"About what?"

"About what to do if Cas never come, if he just can't, and we might have to figure out our own way back?"

Dean stares at him, face grim, brows knitted tight. Eventually he sighs, giving in the stare, licking his lips. "Ok, yeah, you might be right. Can't put all the burden on the man, he might even need our help back home."

<br>

### Chap.1-2 (Cas wake up)(Bobby's, 2011, Bobby POV+Cas)

> **Outline:** Cas passes out for longer than in canon, when he comes to it's past 24h and he's super weak and wounded. He doesn't want to risk Bobby's soul and can't leave the boys behind, but also like he mentioned, now they are lost to him, so he'd have to fight hard in the time flux to find them.

Bobby paces the living room, a few steps in front of the sofa where a bleeding out angel passed out.

"Balls." It might be the hundredth or thousandth time he curses. He doesn't bother counting.

The countdown on the clock is running out fast. Cas doesn't show any sign of waking up.

Bobby frowns deep, throwing looks between the clock and Cas every other second.

Cas crashed into the kitchen little more than three hours ago, leaving a bloody sigil on the fridge door, and practically went straight into the coma. No explanation.

"Balls." Bobby curses under his breath again, staring at the unconscious angel.

The timer soon hits zero. The boys would be waiting in the goddamn wild west a hundred fifty years in the past, the only angel in the room is not waking up. Both waiting for him to save the day, what's he gonna do, wrapping a wing that's never there?

"Ok Cas, don't smite me or anything," Bobby approaches the sofa gingerly, thinking twice, then shaking Cas's shoulder. First not quite harshly, then a lot more. But still, the eyes are closed, the cut on his abdomen is bleeding some ominous bright light.

Bobby slaps his face -- also started easy, all things considered, then a lot less so. But nothing works.

Bobby runs out of idea.

"Balls" is not enough for him given the circumstance. He'd need a stronger word.

<br>

There might be a spell or something useful in the books. Bobby jumps back into the familiar realm, diving into the lore and magic, looking for something that may remotely give some hope, of either bringing the boys home by himself or waking up the angel.

He did wrap a bandage on Cas's abdomen, trying vainly to stop the angelic bleeding. Not gonna do anything to the celestial creature in his true form, sure, Bobby figured that, but maybe healing the vessel might just help him recover a little bit faster? With nothing by hand, all he can do is hope.

And pray.

He has to pray for all of them now. But if not to Cas, to whom?

Glancing at the bloody sigil with Cas's fingerprint that is visibly gradually drying out, it can be a big mistake. Bobby downs a glass of whiskey before doing that.

"Well, call me stupid but none of you are here stopping me, so here goes nothing." Bobby looks up at the ceiling.

"Whatever angel out there," he says, grumpily, can't decide whether to keep the eyes open or shut, settled with squinting, "uh, hope you're on our side. Could use a little help here."

The sigil on the fridge door brightens up, burning into a lit-up golden color, as bright as the light leaking from inside Cas, then dying out slowly. The pattern seems a little shallower than before, muffled, Bobby observes, not sure what it means.

No angel shows up. Not sure if it's good or bad news, either.

Bobby turns back to the books for help.

<br>

Bobby doesn't close his eyes in the first night. The letters on the pages start swimming.

Castiel is still not responding to anything. Face pale, body cold.

Bobby examines his wound -- while murmuring "I don't have a goddamn PhD in angel medics, just so you know" -- the cut is deep, the leaking light is blinding, but Bobby decides it's not as blinding as yesterday. Could be hopeful thinking though, or his eyes are just getting adjusted to angel grace.

He sighs long and deep. "Should have talked them out of this, told you it's a bad idea, but who'd listen?"

The next day passes in the books and regular checks with the angel and alcohols. So is the day after.

Bobby is getting increasingly desperate. "Never thought I'd lose the boys like this, in a time even before they're born."

He slams Castiel's collar, shaking him a lot more violently. "You gotta wake up, Cas." his voice practically pleading. "The boys are waiting for you! Dean's waiting for you!"

Cas lets out a pained groan.

Bobby loosens the grip, putting him down. "Cas?"

Exhaling sharply, Castiel wakes up. Eyes opening slowly, staring straight into the space in front of him, blank, then onto Bobby's screwed face, confused.

He frowns deep, trying to pull himself up from the sofa but wobbly so much that he crashes back down the minute he puts the weight on the legs.

"There he is." Bobby breathes out, not exactly relieved but at least lighter than the past seventy something hours. He lends a hand to help Cas balance. "What happened?"

Castiel tears open the bandage, palm covering the wound. The light and human blood mix together and seep out from between his fingers. He grimaces, telling him with furrowed frown, "I was, uh... I was attacked, betrayed by one of our own."

"Should see the other guy, right?" Bobby tries putting a light tone there.

Castiel probably doesn't get the reference, he answers anyway. "Rachel -- I had to kill her. But I was wounded. Need to use some safety, so... thank you."

"You mean that finger painting?" Bobby eyes the sigil that he has stared for so long over the past few days that he'd already memorized the thing. It's barely visible now. Only a smudged blood stain.

Cas follows his eyes, frowning deeper. "Is there any other angels coming around this place while I was unconscious?" he glares at Bobby.

Bobby shrugs. "Not that I know of."

Cas looks into him, voice graver. "Did you... pray to them?"

Bobby tilts his head, having a bad feeling but has to defend himself. "Well, you're out, boys need a ride home, what else was I supposed to do? So yeah, distress call."

Cas looks like he was about to snap, but decides at the last minute to turn it into a sigh. His lips thin into a line. "You might just put both of us in extreme danger -- me, especially. Since Raphael might already hear it and find where I am, or at least close enough. I could be dead any minute by now if it's not still shielding me."

Defeated, Bobby takes half a step back, trying to give Cas some space as he gives another attempt to stand up. "Well, I'm sorry. I guess. Was really out of option there."

"How long was I unconscious?" Cas leaves the sofa, walking shakily toward the desk.

"Three days, give or take." Bobby answers, without having to check the time. "Now would really be a good time to bring the boys home. Should have enough fun in the Frontierland by now."

"I can't." Cas drops his head, facing away from Bobby.

"Come again?"

"The fight... it drained me." Cas shifts his feet. Uneasy. "And it's been too long. They're lost to me already."

Bobby scowls at his back, snapping. "Then found them! You can't just leave Sam and Dean in the past like that!"

"I know." Castiel turns back, looking at Bobby in the eyes, solemnly. Determined. "So I'll still go, and try my best, but I don't know what's the chance. If I don't make it back..." he breaks the gaze, "please know that I'm truly sorry and I mean it."

With that, and a disturbance of wind flow in the room, Castiel is gone.

"What does that --" Bobby takes two steps ahead, right next to where the angel was, but it is so clear there is nothing left there anymore.

### Chap.2-1 (Dean leave Sunrise)(Sunrise, 1861, Dean)

> **Outline:** Dean prays to Cas but doesn't get answer, they figure Cas said they're lost to him, so the idea is to do something "noisy" (big enough to get some notice from the future but not too big to disturb the history) so that their existence might be like some beacon in the timeline, hopefully making it easier for Cas to locate.
>
> Dean goes ahead start doing the reckless noisy things, Sam stay behind at Samuel Colt's place continue researching (time travel spell: angel feather, sands of time, tears of a dragon)

"Get out of my house." Samuel Colt grumbles, without bothering lifting his head. His colt on the desk by his hand -- a normal one, not the special one he'd already given to them.

"I'm really sorry to bother you again," Sam steps gingerly ahead, Dean follows him a few steps behind. "I wouldn't bother you if it's not absolute urgent."

"Thought I already did my share of help." He eyes them. "Don't tell me the Colt didn't work on the creature you're hunting."

"No, it's not that." Dean chimes in, "It worked, but uh... it's something else we can use a little help there."

"What part of *I'm retired* failed you?"

*Jesus, Samuel is clearly not an easy one to work with.* Dean thinks quietly, eyebrow raised a few inches.

"Like I said, in our time, you're sort of a really big deal, the most famous hunter -- " Sam manages a tight smile, as friendly as he can pull.

"Heard you the first time."

"So we figure you'd be the best supernatural researcher around here too." Dean pulls an puffery grin with his best effort.

"Please, we are not asking you to hunt with us or anything," Sam continues. "Just need a little help in research."

<br>

It turns out their guess isn't too far off. Samuel has as big of a book collection as Bobby's or Campbell's, right downstairs in the place where a cellar should be, but with tons more additional traps and sigils painted on every inch of floor and walls.

Panic room *and* library, nice. *Classic.* Dean looks around, thinking how *fun* it must be to be able to spending all the time reading while hiding out here.

Sam nudges him, eyeing the rows of books. He nods back.

Research time.

<br>

"Don't you think if there's a way to pull it off here and now, someone would have done that already?" Dean puts a book down after god knows how many hours, wiping his face by his hands, giving his brain some break. "Then why didn't we ever run into people time-traveled from the past all the time?"

Sam doesn't move his eyes away from whatever he's scanning. "They don't know what we know." he deadpans.

*But they don't know much about this time thing, either.* Dean thinks. It's always just Cas swinging them around, or some other douchebag angels occasionally. Just popping in and out, not really much theory or science to learn about.

Should probably have asked a few more questions about how time flux thing works. He realizes belatedly. But after all, not everyone is as nerdy as Sam.

"I just remember Cas said once that time travel isn't easy but not impossible," Dean thinks hard, poking some corner of old memories, the time when he met mom and dad when they were younger than his age, the other time when they were trying to stop the yellow-eyed demon but still failed utterly, even the time when he got flipped to the messed-up five years into the zombie land future that turns out never would come. What did Cas tell him during those short talks?

"He said that time is fluid, it's not easy, but apparently the angels have no problem bending it once in a while."

Sam jerks his head up, eyes bright with understanding, "And he also told us this time before we left, that the further back he sent us, the harder it becomes to retrieve us, that's why he said we can't stay for more than twenty four hours, or we'd be lost to him."

"Which means we are totally lost to him by now and no way home without the wings." Dean says bitterly.

"No, Dean!" Sam jumps to his feet. "That might be the idea! This book here also said something similar, quite many are saying the same thing actually, I just didn't realize they might be literal, thought it's more metaphorical."

He slides the book over with some illustration that looks like a river with sand banks on its sides, "Imagine the time is like river or something, fluid, rapid turbulence flow of some kind, and each of us is like a floating leaf. Cas can bend the waterway so it becomes non-chronological, the downstream touches the upstream, that's how we landed here. And folding some part off would be to fast-forward into the future. But if we stay here for too long, we are like the leaves washed away by the flow by too far, that's probably why he can't find us, because he doesn't know where we are in the time flux anymore."

Dean's brows knit into a knot. "So... If we make some noise, *splash!* Fish jump out of water, we can make ourselves stand out in this timeline river somehow, so he can find us."

"Like temporal beacons. It might work -- assuming Cas is still out there looking for us." Sam's voice gets quieter at the last clause.

"He's out there." Dean says reflexively. Sam doesn't look convinced.

Dean gives the river picture a second look-over, thinking it over again, a minor smile starts showing. "Sounds like a plan to me. What kind of noise are we talking about?"

Sam looks a little caught by the question, shrugging unsurely. "How would I know? Something big enough to get some notice in the future, I guess? I would definitely notice if your face show up in some old western posters, guess you can finally make a name for yourself in this era, like you always wanted, huh?"

Sam throws a half smile in his brother's direction, knowing him too well.

Dean's eyes glints. "Any catch I need to know before messing up the time?"

Tip of Sam's mouth twitches. "Just like you said but, eh... don't mess up the time too much? Butterfly effect, remember? We just came back from the Titanic world like, last week?"

Dean returns an unimpressed look. "Let me, umm, just try one more time, just to be sure."

Glancing up, he prays hard and loud, "Castiel, Angel of the Lord, if you have your ears on, come pick us up here, alright? Or we're gonna do something that can *possibly* break the history, you hear me?"

He waits. One second. Two seconds. Three seconds. No stir of air, no wings, no feathered angel. No Cas.

Dean breathes out. "Okay then, let's do this, make some noise! Fun time!"

"Umm," Sam has a look of reluctance, slowly sitting back down.

Dean narrows his eyes. "You're not coming with me."

Sam spreads his hands wide, empty palms facing up -- all they have is a big pile of nothing. Resigned, he says, "Look, Dean, I know how much faith you have on Cas, I really hope I do too, but we just don't know. We could break the history and timeline and everything, and Cas might never come, and we would still be stuck here. I'm gonna find another way, a spell or something, things we can do *by ourselves*, swim our way back if we can."

"And you'll just stay here the whole time, researching?" Dean throws a quick glance at the stairs leading out of the cellar. "Samuel here doesn't look like he welcomes any guest, let alone long-term tenant."

"Not too different from Bobby?" Sam curls up his lips a little.

Dean considers, huffing a quiet laughter. "Yeah, right, we are professionals in handling half-retired grumpy old drunk hunters."

They exchange an agreeing look. So it is decided.

Dean stands up, moving around the table, leaning in to give his brother a half-hug.

"See you around then, Sammy." He pats his back slightly before pulling back. "I'll drop by picking you up after I find Cas."

"And how do I find you, if I find the spell?" Sam asks.

Dean grins. "Read the newspaper."

<br>

"So, you finally decide to move on?" Elkins gives him a once-over. "Where's your brother?"

Dean has a red bandana wrapped around his mouth. He changed into new shirt and pant -- new for him, old for the clothes -- dirt and stains making him look exactly like the rest of the folks in the place.

*The look of a pilgrim,* Dean realizes.

He doesn't answer. Just strides straight into the room, heading directly for the bartender they've grown familiar with over the past couple of days. Dean lets out a breath, tasting a tad of bitterness lingering on the tip of his tongue.

Drawing the pistol from the holster at his waist in a smooth swing, he fires three shots into the ceiling. Some girls scream behind him.

Elkins looks at him, reaching for something hidden underneath the bar stand. Supposedly a shotgun.

"I suggest not." Dean shifts his aim toward him. The bartender stops moving, hands slowly rising.

"What's this about?" The old man is still surprisingly chill, not even showing much curiosity.

*Just how many gangsters has he run into before?* Dean finds himself wondering.

"What every outlaw around here wants," he says, aiming for a deep, grave voice. "You got any hidden treasure around here? Gold would do too."

"At least leave me a name to pass your story along?" Elkins slowly reaches for a side drawer in his gaze. The gold he offers includes some of the very pieces they paid for their meals over the past few days. Dean has to push down the unease.

"Eastwood. Clint Eastwood. Best gunner in the western world," Dean tells him, with a mocking smile.

"We'll see about that." Three gunshots are released within the next second. Not Dean's this time. He dives behind an overturned dining table. A bullet narrowly misses his cheek, air squeaks sharp and heated.

"Son of a bitch!" He shouts out. Dirt on the ground flies into air, the room is hazy for a second. He can't see much.

Dean blinks hard, looking left and right, trying to figure out what now.

"What the hell?" he thinks out loud. Guess the first rodeo isn't always very successful even for bonafide western gangsters.

"Well, *Hell* sends regards." Elkins' steps are right in front of the table. Dean risks a glimpse, catching the sight of black eyes.

"Freaking demon!" He growls, at the same time of ducking into a gap between the stools, exactly when the table he was hiding behind gets shot a gun hole around the place where his heart would have been.

A second gun shot is fired from behind him. Damnnit, *demons*, plural. A whackload of them, it seems.

He hears giggling from the same direction where the gunshot comes, the place where the saloon ladies usually gather. If they are all possessed, he counts four already.

Even with the Colt he hasn't really had won any advantage over that many demons all at once, and god knows how many more might crawling in as they speak.

"Surprised to see us?" Elkins' voice sounds harsh and edgy, nothing like what he sounded like when he spoke with them in the past. "We kill everyone close to Samuel Colt, just so you know."

"Huh, usually the other way around," Dean amuses. "So this is how it's like to hanging around with a big name."

"You are some big name, boy?" The demon in Elkins smirks.

"That's the goal." Dean answers absent-mindedly, while tightens the grip on the pistol, silently counting the number of bullets he has left. *A bit low on ammo already,* he shifts the grip slightly, thinking, *he has to figure a way out fast*.

The exit door is two tables' distance away, with the three lady demons in between, but the side window is only one table away, with buckets of alcohols within range. He calculates his route.

The demons circle closer. Their footsteps heavy, dresses of the ladies rustle relentlessly.

Dean risks another look from the edge of his hideout. All of them have a gun in their hands. Since when do demons kill human with guns? Western cowboy demons? He teases the thought, finding it not as unpleasant as he thought.

The demon possessing the bartender lets out a raspy laughter. "You will die, Clint Eastwood."

"Huh, it's actually nice hearing people say that, you know. Sorta the point, could be a line for the movies." Dean estimates the timing and the distance, swinging a stool at the foot of the closest demon girl, diving side way. Darla, the saloon girl cornered him the first day, yells angrily, eyes turning black, swooping for him.

"Sorry about that." Dean says, a bit apologetically. Then dives for the bucket stack, kicking them loose.

A bucket rolls into the center of the saloon, alcohol leaking from a crack, leaving a wet trail as it goes. The second one follows, making the trail a pool, soaking the next one inside out.

Dean leaps out of the place through the window right before the demons shoot the spot he was in. Bullets and sparks catch the alcohol, the whole place turns into a big pile of flame and smoke in seconds. Demons hiss furiously inside.

The second floor crumbles down in the flame. Dean only then realizes he forgets to check if there is any human up there, but it's too late already.

He unleashes the horse by the stable, galloping out of the town, heading west without looking back.

<br>

He doesn't slow down until the burning hut is completely out of the view. The sun is setting ahead of him on the horizon. He eases the rein, letting the horse stroll.

Dean glances back at the wild plain territory behind him, barely anything to see. Barren and wild, cactus and weed growing from sand, no sign of civilization.

"No coming back to Sunrise, Wyoming now." He sighs, patting the duffel bag and roll of blanket wrapped tightly on the back of the horse, the same way he'd check the Impala's trunk has everything he needs for the road.

Dean removes the Sheriff's pin from his shirt. "Didn't expect the first gig end up like that, goddamn demons always ruin the day."

He strokes the neck of the horse gently, speaking to her as much as to himself, "What do you think, that's a loud enough distress call to Cas or not?"

He looks up at the sky. The night is falling slowly, the color transitions from dark blue to deep purple. Some stars that are incredibly bright already start shining and blinking above these lands. Light pollution isn't a thing yet.

Pure universe hanging on top of him like a gigantic globe hull, celestial, but not in a biblical way.

Dean lets his fingers combing through horse's hair, feeling the creature's muscle rise and fall as it jogs. "Yeah, I know." He says quietly, "Probably not."

Him not being home already is proof by itself.

"Looks like just you and me and the whole wild west now, Baby." He pats the horse. "Come on then, let's head west and make some more noise, he'd have to hear one of them. Good thing all the land between here and the ocean are free to go."

The whole wild west ahead of him, free to explore.

But Dean isn't anywhere near ecstasy. It's just too damn far away from home.

### Chap.2-2 (Cas time travel)(Time flux, Cas+Raphael)

> **Outline:** Cas's in no condition to time travel but he worries about Dean too much so he risks flying into the time flux in his wounded state, leaving bloody trace behind. His trace exposes him, Raphael follows him into the time flux, so he has to escape the chase while tries to locate Dean, Cas crash lands in Sunrise Wyoming but Dean's not there.

"This is stupid, even for you." The thundering voice sounds up above him. Cas doesn't need to look up to know who has found him.

The stab pierces through the abdomen of the vessel, but it's even worse for his true form. The outer ring gets a deep cut through, almost reaching the middle ring. The root of one of the right wings is also wounded. He can barely fly straight.

*It's like leaving blood trace behind in the open sea,* he thinks distantly. *He's the drowning swimmer, attracting the sharks.*

"Thought I can at least have a head start before you catch up." Cas answers. Beating his wings the hardest he can. The pain tears through his wings with each slap. But he has to keep going.

Below them, the time flux is flowing, bright and sparkling. Almost like flying in the space, appreciating the galaxy. In a way, time is no different from space.

"So you know I'd found you, sooner or later." Raphael amuses. The flow from the archangel's wings disturbs this time dimension like a tornado sweeping through wild plain. "I didn't know you're the suicidal type."

"Not suicidal." Cas dives lower, avoiding the central turbulence, trying to use the left wings to remedy the wounds on the right side. He doesn't bother checking if the bleeding of grace is getting worse. The bandage Bobby helped wrapping him with didn't do anything. His essence is running out fast.

He's running out of time too.

*Not suicidal. It's desperate.*

It's actually funny. Cas's mind somehow wanders away. If Dean is here, he'd definitely make a remark about how you can even running out of time when you're literally *in* the time dimension, scouting the time flux.

He can't think of any joke himself.

*Not suicidal, but just for finding the people too important to lose.* He just need enough time to find them before Raphael gets a hold of him and undoubtfully damns him into the eternality of killing him over and over again.

The time flux has an urgent turn around nineteenth century, with the Civil War and everything, the history is not so easy to make out. Cas squints his eyes, focusing on the reflections in the time flux --

That's when he loses his balance suddenly. A harsh tear on tip of his top left wing makes him gasp in pain, the inner ring shrinks in reflex, like how a human would yell and jump back at an unexpected strike of pain.

Cas curls his left wings for self-protection, dropping the flying height. Raphael's big shadow swooping right on top of him, like an eagle diving for its prey sparrow.

He manages a sharp turn to avoid the followed attack. The tip of the lower wings dipping into the time flux, catching a damp from the early twentieth century.

Cas resets his rings and wings, swirling backwards.

"You do know it is pointless to fight or hide from me, do you?" Raphael mocks, turning around as well, following him two wings' distance away.

"How do you find me?" Cas asks, hoping vainly that the talks might distract the archangel for a split of heartbeat time for a break, while widening all the eyes he has to scan through the time flux. It's been a while since he has to fight in the time dimension in his true form, even longer to have to find a soul in here, if ever.

But surely the familiarity and the profound bound should make it easier? Cas starts getting anxious, finding the time flux all look the same rapid and more confusingly dazzling than he remembers. Something disturbing is going on in these western times, but he doesn't know what, and Dean is there, going through the weird time and history on his own, without wings and without protection.

Cas flaps his wings more rapidly, bearing all the tearing sensation in the rings and wings. Not caring that the more rapid he goes, the faster the grace is bleeding and losing, spilling from his true form like dripping blood along the way.

Then for the second time, the disturbance in the air hits him sharp from the center, he almost falls directly into the time flux below.

The archangel didn't even unleash his supernova-explosion-level grace, just using the tips of his wings that are as sharp as any metal in the universe that can ever be, almost cutting him in half.

Castiel screams in pain in his true voice. The time dimension echoes his sound. Raphael laughs behind him in satisfaction.

"I can smell your bleeding grace from two galaxies away, Castiel." Raphael tells him, tone satisfying. "Let alone that human you hang out with, gave us a loud and clear coordinate. So give up, Castiel, you can't hide from me in any time or space. I will always find you, and I will always destroy you."

The second swing of cutting comes from the other side, Cas hears it coming before it hits him, he ducks sideways. The archangel's feathers are like natural angel blades, they scratch his innermost ring, missing the heart of his essence by mere inches.

He might be killed any minute now. Cas thinks bitterly. And then Dean and Sam would be trapped in the western wasteland in the past, forever. They won't even reach the time when the first Impala was ever produced when they die of old age -- *if* they die of old age. They won't ever come back home again.

Cas blinks his eyes hard, opening all his wings again, wounded or not, shooting upwards. Directly into Raphael from below. The rings around his essence spin fast and urgent, like a rapidly beating heart.

Raphael doesn't expect the change of direction in his moves. He has no time of diverting.

Castiel uses his whole existence as bullet, the momentum as the fuel, hitting Raphael in his most vulnerable ring -- the same part in Cas that is beating and spinning glaringly, the innermost ring around the essence. Raphael is pushed out of balance, for a split of heartbeat time, out of control of where he's heading.

Castiel catches the blink of opportunity when Raphael does not have eyes on him, diving straight into the time flux below him.

The time dimension swirls and rotates around him, absorbing him into the point he hits. The speed of rotation makes his rings twist and deform. No wonder every time he pops Dean in and out, he'd complain about motion sickness. This must be the exact dizziness a human would feel if he doesn't have any grace left.

The thought makes his heart thumps hard and cold.

*Did he lose all the grace just to reach them? How is he gonna take them home now?*

Without any answer to any of the questions, his feet land on the solid ground again. Castiel tumbles ahead, dropping on his all fours, spitting blood onto the sandy ground in front of him. The view is swimming, the ground is floating up and down as if he's being washed away by the tide. He has to focus very hard to not let the cold, shaky limbs give way here and now.

Wind blows, the sand rises around him. The vessel coughs, more blood dripping, from everywhere, not just from his mouth.

Cas only gets time to see a wooden sign with a neat carving saying "Sunrise, WYO." before the world turns total black.

>
> (Dean pray to Cas every night, bad feeling)

#### Act 1 ("Unforgiven")

The life on road on horseback and the life on road in car has more similarity than Dean has ever realized. Like the quietness in the night, the road and space all dark, when it seems the whole world dissolves, leaving only him and the Baby floating in the space.

Except, with the black horse, with its rising and falling rhythm of muscle, the feeling of being accompanied by some living, breathing thing is somehow so very soothing. Almost as if he's accompanied by someone he knows.

Dean presses his palms on the horse's back, just to feel its heartbeat. Then slowly feeling his own heartbeat calming down.

He looks up at the starry sky, closing his eyes, exhaling deep, smelling the sand and bushes. *Where are you, man?* He can't help thinking, not even sure if that's a prayer or just a haunting thought keep replaying itself in his mind.

He lets the horse decide the road for him, leaving his own mind wandering -- that's another similar yet different experience as driving, one he can actually taking eyes off the road long enough and need not to worry about crushing into another incoming vehicle.

When the night is deep into the dark and cold hour, he lets the horse rest. Finding a relatively soft spot on the sandy lands, wrapping himself in the blanket, he rests his own eyes for a handful of hours. Then moves on again before the sun fully rises.

Dean thinks about that illustration image of the time flux all the time. The shape of a river, and a floating leave flowing down the stream. He feels exactly like that floating leave now.

<br>

There are towns scattered here and there on the western lands like stars in the night sky. Without a map, Dean doesn't know how exactly he can find one, but the horse knows the ways better than he does. Sometimes he wonders how many places she has already been to.

She leads them into a small town, its name reads Thunderhill, Colorado, according to the wooden plaque swinging outside of the town.

The place looks like a replica of Sunrise, Wyoming, except the main road through the town is wider. Men in fine and well suits come and go on horsebacks, ladies in delicate, laborious dresses. The view is actually somewhat pleasant to enjoy, but Dean is not here for sightseeing.

He goes into the saloon -- at least this has to be universal in all times and all places, there must always be a saloon in each western town, for his comfort.

The girls are more enthusiastic and younger here than Elkins' place. Dean meets their eyes -- they are old-time good-looking, mostly. They grin at him in professional smiles, Dean walks toward the owner of the place and asks for a room.

"You want to pick one you like?" The skinny man behind the counter asks meaningfully, nodding at the girls.

Dean glances back, finding their eyes intensely on his back. He gives a short chuckle, "Nah, just for sleeping."

"Your loss." The man makes a face, pointing him the stairway.

He should probably start planning his grand criminal plan some time soon. Dean thinks as he drags his steps up the stairs, feeling his bones and muscles complaining about sleeping on the wild ground for too many nights in a row, it's making his joints and neck stiff and wrecking like a beat-up car. He has to have at least one decent night before thinking about some big history-breaking-level moves.

Dean throws himself onto the bed that smells something suspicious, but probably wouldn't be too different from those cheap motels he has been used to for his whole life. Dean falls asleep like that without bothering taking his clothes off.

He is waken up several hours later by some loud crying and yelling by the next door. A man is angrily shouting "Whore!" and cursing, and a girl is screaming helplessly. Something is thrown to the floor, crashing to pieces.

Dean jumps to his feet, dashing out to the next room without thinking.

A man twice bigger than him is standing on the lone bed in the center of the room, all naked and hairy, holding a knife in his hand high above head, almost touching the ceiling.

The crying girl curls at the corner of the bed like a startled little creature, wrapping herself up in arms, covering the face with fingers. Unclothed and crying loudly, screaming for her life. Blood streaming from between her fingers.

Dean recognizes her from the group of saloon ladies that greeted him when he arrived.

He approaches the man carefully, eyeing the knife, shortening their distances, tone demanding, "Why don't you put the knife down and let's talk?"

The man glances back at him for a split second, grumbles, "Go away. None of your business."

"It's my business because I was waken up." Dean takes another step ahead, barely a dive's distance away from him now. He tries to hint the girl to get away while the man's distracted, but the girl is just busy crying. He can't tell where that blood comes from and it worries him.

"Very well." The man gnarls. "I'll deal with you once I kill the bitch."

"Can't let you do that." Dean marches the remaining two steps in a heartbeat, arms dragged around the man's waist, pulling him off balance and falling off the bed. The knife is still in his hand.

The man struggles violently and gets loose from Dean's hold, fumbling on to his feet, throwing himself at him.

Dean gets pinned to the ground by the weight, wrestling with all the fighting skills he has picked up over the years, but the battle techniques for creatures are not as useful on a pissed off cowboy.

The man fights like a gorilla, ending up straddling him with one hand pressing on Dean's chest, stopping him from attempts of getting away, the other hand pressing the tip of the knife on his cheek. "You should keep your nose clean." He grits the yellow teeth.

The knife feels cold against his skin. Dean wonders how much he can move his head before it stabs through his skull.

"Cleaner than yours." Dean barks back, staring the man in the eyes deadly focused as if they're in a gun duel. He moves suddenly, so quick that the other doesn't have time to react, and Dean already breaks his hands free from grasp. He twists his wrist in a way that the man has to loose the hold of the knife, and next second, the knife lands in Dean's hand.

Just in a blink's time, their positions shift. Dean holds the knife an inch away from the man's neck, but already close enough to make his point clear. The man stills.

Dean demands, "Now you want to explain what's the matter with the lady?"

Right this second, three men dash into the room, all in uniforms, with a sheriff's pin on the chest of the leading aged man.

"Put down your knife, for Christ's sake!" Three shotguns point at him. The Sheriff steps closer, solemnly, eyes moving between both him and the man in his compliance.

Dean knows better than carrying a knife to a gun fight with three cowboy lawmen.

He lets his hand fall and tied behind his back by a rough rope. The other guy tied to the same wooden stake on the ground.

The Sheriff glares between them. "Now, talk!"

Dean purses his mouth, glancing at the girl in dismay at his rescue.

An elder lady is attending to her wounds. She removes the hand very slowly and reluctantly from her face. Tears are still falling down unstoppingly. A long, bloody cut diagonalizes on her young, pretty face, narrowly missed her eyes, but cutting all the way from forehead across the cheek, reaching the edge of the jaw. One that would undoubtfully leave a permanent scar on that face.

The man tied behind him grumbles, "He came out of nowhere and wanted to kill me, you saw how he moved with a knife. I have to self defend."

Dean rolls his eyes. Should have known, son of bitches around here always mouthful of lies. "Only because he's two seconds away from killing that lady."

"Bitch had it coming." He growls. Dean can feel his shrug against their tied-together back.

"What did she do?" The Sheriff asks.

The naked cowboy doesn't answer.

"Mike, what did she do?"

"She chuckled when she saw his tiny junk, that's what." The elder lady turns from cleaning the wounds on the girl's face, talking on her behalf, snapping harshly. "Now look what he did! She's ruined!"

She's not wrong, his junk dangles pitifully as he moves around earlier. Dean has to strangle a chuckle of his own, but the crowd around them isn't as generous. The cowboy Mike growls something in his breath, the sound throttled in his throat like a caged tiger huffing.

The skinny man behind the counter chimes in. "There has to be justice, Little Bill. Who would want a whore with scarred face? I bought her last spring, and it's a damaged good now. She could have served for another five ten years."

*Wow.* Dean thinks. *Talking about authenticity. The rural, cruel world for the ladies is just part of this era. Those classic movies aren't kidding.*

The Sheriff Little Bill glances between the saloon owner and the naked cowboy, then checks on Dean again. "And you're just being a good man playing hero?"

Dean shrugs. "What can I say, just another day of my life."

The Sheriff snorts, turning to the cowboy. "How many horses do you have, Mike?"

"Five." He answers.

"Alright, here's the deal. By spring, you take two of the finest horses and bring them here to Skinny. And we call it even. What do you say?" The Sheriff convicts.

"What, nothing for the girl there?" Dean blurts out, feeling ridiculous. "She's disfigured! He just ruined her whole life!"

"Why don't you wed her if you're so concerned?" Little Bill retorts.

*What an asshole.* Dean stares at the man's face, forgetting for a second he's in their land and time, wants nothing more than giving him, the shitty cowboy and the skinny saloon owner, one punch at nose for each of them. *Call it justice.*

"You are not even gonna whip him?" The elder lady heckles in disbelief.

"Isn't there enough blood shed?" The Sheriff does not look back at the ladies, simply nods at the crowds. The conviction is concluded. "Gentlemen, good night." He heads out.

The two deputies untie their hands and follow him out.

Dean exercises his numb wrist, glancing at the cowboy Mike, wondering how stupid of a move it would be if he gives him a punch again. The Sheriff is barely out of the saloon.

"Off you go, nothing to see now." Skinny shoos the crowd. "Have a good night. And you, Mr. Eastwood --" That's the name Dean registered with earlier. "-- Enough of playing hero, my girls don't need a prince in white horse, they have me. Better if you get going, you understand?"

Dean throws a glimpse at the girls again. The poor wounded one stops crying now, the other girls help wrap a gauze on her face like a pirate's blinder. Blood reddens the cloth. She looks at him, desperate, helpless. Eyes pleading. Hatred shines when she glances at the man who owns her and the man who disfigures her. But it is so clear that there is nothing she can do.

Dean takes his eyes back, walking slowly toward the counter. "Oh, I understand." He says slowly, stopping at an arm's distance away from Skinny. "But you see, I didn't come riding white horse, I came in black."

He gives the man a punch in the face. His own knuckle pained with scratches and blood just by the force in it. But it feels good. It feels right.

He reaches for his collar, aiming for a second blow. The man rises with a pistol in his hand. There is another click of gun safety switch behind his back. Dean doesn't need to look back to know who it belongs to. The girls gasp.

He releases the saloon owner, hands relaxing slowly, but edging toward the holster.

"Should have killed you when I got the chance." The cowboy says.

*Two on one. An odd chance, but not impossible.* Dean calculates. Clint Eastwood definitely could take down more than that number and make a good story. And good thing, he does have two pistols.

"Yes you should." He answers slowly. "Because now you're gonna die."

He can see the man's hand shaking. The pupils dilate. The index finger twitching on the trigger. The dark outlet of the pistol points at his heart menacingly.

Dean holds his breath. His own fingers are inches away from his pistols. The tension vibrates in the air.

Then all of a sudden, at the very same second, four gun shots go out.

Dean ducks to the ground, two pistols in hand, both smoking hot remnants of a shot. A bullet broke a glass on the bar stand. Mike lies on the ground, a bullet hole on the chest, bleeding red, already dead. Skinny falls behind the counter, moaning loud, a hole on his shoulder.

Dean stands up, without a scratch, scrutinizing the naked dead cowboy. "Think twice next time before being an asshole." He spits at him, knowing the other man behind the counter can hear him.

The wounded girl murmurs a heartfelt "Thank you" to him when he passes her to gather his belongs upstairs. And Dean returns a short nod.

This is just gonna be another town that he can never come back.

<br>

#### Act 2 ("Butch Sundance")

Dean doesn't expect to be recognized when he reaches Utah. Words travel faster than his horse, apparently.

But still not fast enough to cross the time and history and let Cas hear, it seems. He just has to keep doing what he already started, with or without a plan -- the path of a western outlaw.

The gang was playing poker at the saloon when he pushes the door open. One of them looks up first, and the rest stops the game.

"Clint Eastwood." They say, not in the most friendly tone.

Dean tenses, fingers reaching toward the pistols automatically.

They laugh loudly and drunkenly, standing up and moving to him, no one pointing guns at him. Dean lowers his hands, squinting, confused.

"Look at this good lad." The one that looks like their leader stand two steps away in front of him, glancing back at the rest of the group. They make a cheerful noise.

Dean stares at him.

"Heard you have quite some body counts on your trail, Clint, but only those who deserved it. Figured you'd try your luck around here about now." The cowboy holds out a hand. "Butch. We are the Hole-in-the-Wall, if you have been around long enough you'd hear us."

Dean huffs a laughter, shaking his hand. "Oh I've heard." He says admiringly, more enthusiastic than he intends. How can he not? The legendary Hole-in-the-Wall gang, not only does he rewatch the movie more times than he can count, but also knows the inside-out of their whereabouts and everyone's ending. Perk of time travel. But that would be years down the road, he wouldn't worry for them yet. Still early enough in time.

"I take it that must be the Sundance Kid?" Dean nods at a sharp-looking man around the desk, who didn't bother to stand up when the others did, a moustache too thick to see the lips.

Butch follows his eyes, nodding, beaming an approval. "So you did hear about us." His tone over glad and polite. It's actually surprising to see one so affable and polite as a gangster, no wonder the gang makes their charming name in the history. If he sticks with them, maybe his name can be branded together and makes out loud like a quick pass? Dean wouldn't complain hanging out with this group if they're truly what the movie shows.

"Come join us, the round on us." Butch gestures, and Dean sits next to him. The group resumes their poker games.

"Thought you mostly hang around Wyoming?" He can't help wondering out loud. "What makes you move to Utah?"

Butch laughs while pouring him a glass. "What can I say, we run out of banks there."

"Already?" Dean amuses. There gotta be another thirty years before their lights out, would there be any bank left in the states for them to rob? He wonders, but knowing that would be a question that spoils the future and more importantly, what he knows and where he comes from, Dean is clever enough to remember to keep his mouth shut.

Butch doesn't notice his pause, just shrugs. "There will be more once we finish with Utah and Arizona and all those barbaric places. We'll come back to Wyoming again. They keep building new banks like growing harvests to reap. What a nice way of provoking new fortune, wouldn't you say?"

Dean laughs and nods, drinking the alcohol in the glass. It's not beer, and it tastes better than Elkins' stock.

"You have job in this town?" Three drinks later, Dean asks. With poker cards in his hands, Sundance is dealing.

"Right down the road, the new bank has only two guards and closes at sunset." Butch tells him. Dean wonders curiously how come no one in the place hears their loud discussion of a robbery and not raise an alarm. But glancing around, judging by how drunk most forks are and it's still in the bright afternoon, the answer isn't too difficult to realize.

"You want to join?" Butch plays his cards, glancing at him. "We can use a man like you."

Dean looks at his cards, pretending he's thinking about what to play next. "Sure." He says, picking two cards and throwing on top of the ones Butch just played.

"Sundance can cover you if things go bad." Butch says in a light tone, no sign of worry or concern.

"I'm relieved." Dean answers with a smile.

They leave the saloon about half an hour before the sunset. Not all of them can walk straight, but they don't need everyone in the action anyway.

The robbery goes smoothly.

"The money isn't yours, life is. The company will pay the loss, don't try to be a hero." Butch tells the people in the bank, with a gun in his hand. Dean and Sundance by his side.

The guards don't even try to keep up a fight. Dean lock them inside the safety chamber and take the case with gold and cash out, passing to Butch.

They leave the town in galloping before the Sheriff is informed or the deputies get a chance of chasing. The town is out of view shortly, the gang cheers with the profit.

"Well, that was easy." Dean smirks.

"That's your first robbery?" Butch glances at him.

"You can say that." Dean decides the one with the demons doesn't count.

"You are a natural." Butch compliments.

They keep moving south.

<br>

Dean notices a poster of his own face outside the bank in a town in Arizona during scouting. Next to the ones of Cassidy and Sundance. Headlining the price of wanted. The name under his sketch is "Clint Eastwood", at least that makes he smile a little.

He goes back to Butch and says it might not be a good idea to rob here again, the guards can probably recognize them easily enough.

"You're afraid?" Butch raises an eyebrow. "Afraid of death?"

"No." Dean defends automatically, but his thought does wander briefly imagining his own dead body lying on the bank floor, bleeding out with a gun hole to the heart, imagining Cas finds him like that, or Sam. Or no one does and they never find out what happened to him. He swallows down the lump in the throat. "But isn't it better to stay alive?"

Butch considers, agrees to skip this town.

The next town is the same, the wanted price gets even higher. The bank has more guards than they saw before, and there are patrols on the road, carrying rifles.

"That's getting ridiculous." Dean complains. "Where do they find so many people protecting some printed paper, but no one really do a girl a solid justice?"

"Welcome to the Wild West." Butch says.

"Are we switching gears now?" Dean asks. Trying to remember the timeline of events for them in the history. He still keeps in mind Sam's warning about not to mess up with the real important history stuff, and wonders what's the odds Cas can see a wanted poster of him and knows where and when he is.

"What do you mean?" Butch doesn't follow.

Dean finds himself have the big moment of realization that this very idea of robbing trains might actually comes from him. He tells them, "Where do money in banks come from?"

"The carriages?" One of the members offer.

"And where do the carriages get them from?"

"The train." Butch starts smiling.

"There is a railway line right across Arizona." Dean doesn't need an updated -- outdated, in this sense -- map to know what's the atlas is like. "We just need some dynamite."

They gather the dynamite, so much more than what they actually need, and blow the safety case to the sky. The poor clerk from the Union Pacific Flyer murmurs his protest through the whole thing, landed bloody and a broken arm after the smoke from the blast is cleared. But at least he's still alive.

Printed cash flies in the sky like falling snow flakes. The gang cheers and robs the money, stuffing as much as they can grab inside their jacket pockets and bags. Dean catches a few that fall close to him and regards the patterns and numbers on the paper. Butch watches him from the periphery of his eyes.

By night, they are out of Arizona. The small saloon in Nevada doesn't know their names or faces. They order for drinks and rooms, and accompany of the fine ladies, many of them tipping over generously with the new fortune they just gained, leaving for the second floor way earlier than the usual turn-in hour.

Dean stays by the bar, sitting in a corner seat, soaking in the drink. Some town folks are playing banjo and harps in the empty space around the tables, the music loud and cheerful, just as western as it can be. Some girls sways to the music, then dancing, some men join them soon after.

Dean watches the group as if he's just watching an old western movie up close, but he's not really expecting to be inside the scene. He remembers there was one time he was absent-mindedly watching a rerun of *The Outlaw Josey Wales* in the motel when Cas dropped by.

"The classicest of the classic, the western to rule them all." He told him.

Cas sit down next to him on the motel bed, watching the screen that was way too small. They should watch it here, like this, surrounded by music and dancing people three hundred and sixty degree immersive, that's how they could get the whole vibe.

But Cas was already attracted. And Dean was pleased he could interest Cas with a western classic, only to realize minutes later that it's the music instead of the plot that caught Cas's attention.

"It was beautiful." Cas said, in deep contemplation.

Dean glanced at him, seeing the constant frown unfold in between the angel's eyebrows. His expression calm and peaceful, watching the television with a look that says his thoughts were already wandering elsewhere. Dean wondered if it was how the real wild west was, and if Cas had been there. And he decided, he must have, being an angel and watching the earth for longer than any human history.

"What was it like?" He remembered asking him, can't help himself. "The real wild west? The towns and people's lives two hundred years ago?"

Cas tilted his head ever so slightly, recalling, "Noisy," he told him. "Very vibrant and alive. I remember the music, they were beautiful. And the people were so simple, the life was simple back then. But also bloody. A lot of blood and deaths, like the human history all the time."

He just nodded, attention back to the television, with a quick glimpse at Cas once in a while. His lips curled up a little bit at that quiet, comfortable moment stretching between them. That was one of the few moments he got to relax when they were busy handling the apocalypses.

He wishes Cas is here with him, watching the dance, listening to the music. He's pretty sure Cas would enjoy it a lot and comment with something like the history of the harp or the name of their dance.

"You are not like any man I ever know." The voice sounds up right next to him and gives Dean quite a start he almost pulls his gun in reflexive, only to find Butch sits down on the stool next to him, with a glass of dark color liquid in his hand.

Dean relaxes his muscles, leaning back to the back of the seat. "I'm not like any other men." He replies.

"You're not after fortune but you rob." Butch observes, then adds. "Or woman, but you're certainly thinking of someone. Is there someone waiting for you to get back to, Clint?" His eyes glance temporarily on Dean's fingers where the rings are.

"You can say that." Dean takes a drag from his glass.

"Then why don't you go back to her?" Butch asks, not in a manner of probing privacy, but genuine wondering like a friend would do.

Dean decides there is no point of correcting the pronoun, just to not complicate things. "I'm on my way." He says, as much of a fact as he can offer. "We get separated, so now I need to figure out my way to home."

"You have a home to go back to." Butch looks surprised. "Most people around here don't, that's why we move all the time."

Dean hums, taking another sip, not really tasting the flavor of the liquid, wondering how the home would be like now. Bobby might be anxious to death, wandering around his study, trying all kinds of different spells and rituals; Sam should still in Samuel's place, don't know if he'd find a solution or anything closer by now; and Cas... Cas is still MIA and no one ever seen or heard of him ever since they departed that day. How long had that been? How long would they meet again if ever? What if Sam was right and Cas is already gone and... Dean takes a large gulp to wash down the growing panic in his stomach, feeling the throat still too dry.

"You alright?" Butch reads his face.

Dean hates it when people around him seem always can read his thoughts on his face. "Yeah," he finishes the drink, leaving the glass on the bar and standing up. "Can use some sleep now, see you in the morning. Have a good night."

Butch nods, and wishes him a good night.

Dean lies in the saloon bed for hours, listening to the folk music continuing deep into the night, then falling quiet. His eyes on the ceiling, wondering if Cas can hear him still. He prays anyway.

<br>

They keep an eye on the newspaper and posters while moving around. It's always good to know what the lawmen know about them. And for Dean, he certainly can use a good reminder of how big of a noise in the era that he has made.

The newspapers aren't always accurate -- as they have forever been. But at least the big titles usually get their names right, some included their sketches similar to the wanted posters, others tell an over-detailed story of their robbery:

"Bank robbed in Rattlesnake Bend, Nevada" -- with a photo of empty case where the gold is supposed to be.

"Cowboy killed in Cattle Creek, Kansas, Clint Eastwood's new headcount" -- with paragraphs after paragraphs of some witness saying how legendary he is, but not in the coldblooded way, only elegant and attractive, and that dead cowboy was a bully in the town.

Dean is amused at that one. "We were never even in Kansas!"

And Butch answers with: "That's just how the story travels."

"Silver Gulch, California: Robinhood appears" -- the small secondary title reads: "Mine robbed, Gold for the whole town". A pissed off mine owner's curses take over most of the report.

"Well, that one we might can actually try." Dean says.

Butch hums. Dean's not sure if it means agreement or the opposite.

They have a debate over whether to go to California or New Mexico next when they reach the far south of Arizona.

They end up turning east.

"Would be good to see those mines." Dean mumbles.

"That's just rumors and daydreams." Butch answers.

<br>

The wanted posters with their faces already reach New Mexico ahead of them. Dean has grown beards ever since he saw the first poster in Utah, but the features are probably still recognizable.

They lay low and only sit in the corner seats of the inn.

Dean makes sure his cowboy hat is low enough when he drinks the beer and glances around, staying in the shade. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid sit in the next table, the rest of the gangs scattered around in the town.

The folks sitting by the table next to his chat loudly. He hears the name "Clint Eastwood" occurs in their talks, so he can't help listening in with all the attention.

"You heard about the new rising star of a cowboy?" One of the folks say, "Name Clint Eastwood."

"How big of a name is he?" Another asks, "Louder than Jeremiah Johnson?"

There are laughter in that table. "Bear fighting isn't news anymore, Eastwood is. Rumor says he moves with Hall-in-the-Wall gangs, shooting quicker than the Sundance Kid. But he doesn't shoot unless the guy has it coming. He plays poker, robs banks, puts on a good old gun duel and never loses. Best of all, not like other gangs, he doesn't take the gold and cash for himself, he gives them to people in need. Poor people, folks like you and me."

"A savior and a saint." Someone mocks in laughter. "Exactly what we need nowadays."

"Robin Hood, more like." They say.

"But it doesn't matter how much folks love him, the companies and states sure as hell hate him. I heard Union Pacific Flyer already gathered a posse after the gang, Eastwood, Cassidy and Sundance are all on their kill-at-sight list. They must decide can't afford to have more trains robbed like that."

Dean finishes the rest of his drink in one pull and leaves the place quickly enough.

The rumor is surely not an ungrounded chatter. Under the night sky, hundreds of miles away on the barren, open land to their west, there are a dozen lights as small as fireflies in the summer night moving up and down, in the same pace of horses' running. The night covers the figures, but the hunter's instinct already kicks in, he moves toward his horse.

Butch and Sundance are right after him when he leaves the place.

"Whatever they're selling, I ain't buying." Butch says.

They dash out of the town, then out of the state, heading north.

### Chap.4 (Cas's western life)(Sunrise, 1841, Cas)

> **Outline:** Cas is too wounded to fly again and can't risk using his power in case he gets noticed by Raphael (still scouting in time flux), so he lives in the town like a human, also tries his best to blend in. After a while when he recovers slightly, he asks around if anyone has seen the brothers based on his description but no one does. The town looks relatively new, not so crappy, he asks time and realizes why. He asks if there is any ranch job available instead. (leave suspension)

Cas wakes up in a moan, feeling his fingers and toes too far away, his head as heavy as that time he found a liquor store and drank the whole place.

He opens the eyes, seeing white ceiling of the room he's in. Soft blanket covers his body. He tries to move his hand to lower it, only to find thick bandages wrapping over his whole back and front, restricting the move.

He frowns at the bandage that has hints of blood showing from underneath, trying to remember why his whole body hurts like he has been chopped on a cutting board and he can't heal himself properly.

A middle-aged madam enters his room. "Wouldn't move if I were you." She tells, putting down a plate of food that smells good and greasy.

"Where am I?" Cas frowns.

"Slick Jim's Saloon." The woman answers, her back facing him when she fumbles with something. "Deputy found you unconscious just outside the town and brought you him. Thought you'd be dead with all the wounds and blood, but look at you, still breathing. What happened?"

"I was... in a fight." The memory of the time dimension surfaces. The wingspan of Raphael that covered half the space, casting glooming shadows over him still gives his thought shudder and uneasiness. It must be when he fell into the time flux and got carried here.

"You got an enemy on your tail?" The woman brings a wet towel when she walks over to his bedside. Cas gives her an appreciated tight grin.

"He won't follow me here." Cas tells her. Which is the truth, more or less, until he uses his grace and Raphael finds the traces and catches up to him again, eventually. Cas wonders how much time he can have before that, and more importantly, if he can find Dean and Sam before that. The thought of them floating lost in the history makes him grimace, distracted from the physical wounds for a brief moment.

The woman must has mistaken his grimace for pain, leaning over to lower the blanket to check on the bandage. "You got a name?"

Cas thinks for a second, "Clarence." He says, "Clarence Novak."

"I'm Alice," She says, starts unwrapping the bandage to reveal the wounds on his body. "Helping in the saloon, sometimes patch people up when they need to. Sometimes people, other times just bodies."

Cas watches her hands, old and weathered. "You must have seen many people that need patch up."

"More than I can count." She says plainly.

The layers of the bandages are unwrapped, the pieces that are closest to his skin are soaked in blood. Now he can examine himself. There is a long horizontal cut over his chest, deep and nasty, right over where the heart is. A deep stab wound the shape of angel blade on his right lower abdomen, the one from Rachel that feels like long time ago and still bleeding fresh. Alice guides him turn to his side, using a wet cloth to clean the wound on his back. And from where the cloth touches, one of the long vertical cuts stretches across the spine, from little under the hairline to little above the tailbone. There are a few other shorter cuts on the shoulder blades.

"That enemy of yours pretty much cut you in half." Alice comments.

"I believe that is his intent, yes." Cas agrees in murmur.

She helps clean up all the wounds and the new blood seeping through the stitches, and rises up to fetch more bandage.

"I don't think I'd need those." Cas turns down the offer when he sees what she's about to do.

"And let yourself bleed to death? I don't think so." Alice's hands are strong against his own feeble fingers. The lack of strength in this body that he thought he's getting familiar with after inhabiting for almost four years now surprises him. Cas falls silent and lets her do the job.

He closes his eyes, reaching inside, trying to scratch and find how much grace he still has left. The effort is tiring and the result is frustrating. The only things he can find inside are the twisted guts and bones that bleed as much as the visible cuts on the skin. That explains the taste of metal in his throat.

He has to gesture for a pot and spits out the liquid flooding up from inside. The spit turns out bloody, leaving a bad taste on the tongue.

Alice offers water for a rinse, and looks at him like looking at a dying deer shot by a hunter's shotgun. "I'll be back with something to eat, if you feel like."

The first reaction crosses his mind is to say thank you but he has no need for food, the second one realizes the empty stomach does make his body uncomfortable. Cas gives her a smile and says, "Thank you, that would be nice."

And he is left alone in the room again.

The window of the place has a slit of opening, the smell of alcohol and frying stew passes through from the saloon downstairs. There are sounds of horses passing by, smell of fresh leather and cheap perfume reaches up. There must be some new houses freshly constructed, as Cas can still smell the lingering air of sawdust from raw pine and oak.

Cas closes his eyes, breathing deep in and exhaling out long, feeling the lung expanding and contracting in the most human way. It worries him, reminding him too much of a memory back when Lucifer was walking the earth and Dean was practically the only one standing on his way of starting the Apocalypse, when it was two minutes to the midnight but he couldn't help him anything more than distracting Michael to earn the five minutes he needed. He chews the feeling of being weak, being powerless, unable to protect the human in his charge, and he tastes nothing but bitterness.

Cas thinks about the Stull Cemetery a lot, then Battle Creek, Michigan, the house with a woman and a boy where Dean was humming a tune while mowing the lawn. He should never leave that life, then he would never be lost and trapped in the wild west in the past. Cas breathes out heavily, thinking, with too much of a clarity: *This is all his fault.* And he has to fix it, right all the wrongs, whatever the cost.

Alice comes back with food on a plate. Cas thanks her for it.

<br>

Strength comes back to him as time goes. Cas manages to get out of the bed after about ten days, which is also time when Jim Elkins, owner of the saloon and bartender, starts asking when he's ready to pay for the room.

The cuts are still deep, the muscles around the wood contract uncomfortably at each shift of move, the pain from the wounds are numbed but not gone. Cas puts on an old shirt and pants that Alice found for him and steps downstairs.

The bartender is busy chatting with some folks by the bar. They laugh at some joke or recent news.

Cas decides to wait by the base of the staircase until they move away toward a clean, vacant table in the center of the room.

"There he is, the mysterious man who survived." Elkins regards him. "You look good."

"I look awful." Cas replies unhappily and honestly.

"That's true, I suppose." Elkins' mouth twitches in a small laughter, hands reaching for a used glass to rinse and wash with a white wash cloth. "Meant to visit upstairs but Alice said you were mostly resting. Figured not to disturb a patient."

"By *patient*, you mean *a dying man*." Cas points out, not minding the notion. "I appreciate the help and the place. I needed time to rest and heal, but now I must move on."

"Where are you heading?" Elkins looks at him, eyes sharp like an eagle, short stubbles covering the jaw in a clever shape. A young man like him might have a good enough memory to recall if Dean and Sam have been here.

"Have you happened to remember two brothers visiting here? One good-looking, about my height, the other tall like a giant, long hairs?" Cas gestures his hands around the hair, trying to show how their hair look like by putting fingers in the places.

"Not that I can remember." Elkins shrugs, putting the cleaned glass onto the shelf. "Sounds like someone who'd leave an impression if they do."

Cas's eyes follow his move, thinking. *Maybe they just didn't visit the saloon, which is normal. He'll just have to find them elsewhere.*

Cas is just about to leave for his room, when two people enter the place and the bartender greets them, "Morning, Sheriff. Deputy."

The Sheriff eases onto a stool, putting down the newspaper in his hand. "Can't believe old John actually made it and settled in Texas." He says to the other men, casual chatting, "Never thought he'd name the place *Dallas*."

Cas turns around sharply, moving so fast he can feel some stitches bursting open underneath the bandage. "What did you say?"

The Sheriff looks at him, "What? Dallas?"

Cas doesn't answer, he stills deadly when his eyes land on the paper.

He asks, then, after a long moment, if there is any ranch nearby he can help out.

<br>

###### draft notes

Cas is too wounded to fly again and can't risk using his power in case he gets noticed by Raphael (still scouting in time flux). He lives in the town like a human, also tries his best to blend in. 

(facts but only reveal later in catch-up/flashbacks: To stay in the town for longer and not raise suspicion, Cas starts working in a ranch just to continue pretending to be a normal human. Cas is still weak and low in power, but as time goes by, he's growing back.)

### Chap.5 (Dean meet Cas)(Sunrise, 1861, Dean POV+Cas)

> **Outline:** Dean get chased around by the posse, not realize he's chased back to Sunrise, Wyoming where it all starts; get cornered into the sheriff's office, no escape, too much guns ("are they human or demons?"), Dean desperately pray to Castiel, get jump attacked by a stranger appearing from nowhere, very obviously trying to kill them and very good at fighting, and after a few rounds they realize he's not human. It's Castiel, the original 1860s timeline version, receives order that they're disturbing the timeline and comes to eliminate them (Castiel: "You pray too loud. I really don't know why you act like we are familiar" Dean: "I almost forget how big of an asshole you were before").
>
> Dean almost gets killed (heavily wounded), prays desperately instinctively again to his Cas, and gets saved when this Castiel gets blown away by power (fight a few rounds, Cas absorb 1861!Cas's grace, lighten up to show wings, wipe his memory, blast him away -> cruelest to himself, Dean: "Wouldn't that hurt... you? The old yourself?" Cas: "He has plenty time to recover, I don't." it's his own grace anyway). His Cas is there, dirty cowboy looking (reveal as part of posse), totally blend in and human-like, faceful of "I finally found you".
>
> Dean: "Where have you been?" Cas: "When." Dean: "Wh-- how long have you been here?" Cas: "Twenty years. I landed too early, so I have to wait for you to catch up, wait for time to pass in the slow old way." Dean: "I prayed to you." Cas: "I know." He can hear all the time but can't get to Dean. Dean: "What happened?"

The posse is relentless. They travel across bushes and water that should have covered their traces. And when they hide out behind rocky mountains, their horses are still moving their way, not diverted by the slightest, like hunting dogs catching the scent of prey and never let go.

"Where are they coming from?" Dean wonders aloud. "How can they even follow us like this, we just passed the whole prairie. I don't even know where we are now."

"Must be Indians." Butch looks at them through a monocular, then passes the telescope to Dean. "Some tribes are amazing trackers. They'll never lose the scent once they pick it up until they're dead."

"Awesome." Dean murmurs, emotionlessly.

Sometimes by day, they manage to put another hundreds of miles in between their distance and think it should be safe now. Then by night, once they stop for a few hours of sleep, the shaking lantern lights show up again on the horizon.

"Don't they ever need sleep or let the horses eat and drink or something?" Dean complains as he mounts the horse.

The western life is no fun now -- not like the first few months are entertaining when he was robbing banks and trains, but at least better than having to keep running for his life. He even has nightmares of those shaking lanterns in the distance. Never close enough to grab a clear view, but always there on their tails. It's like some old saying goes, they're like the shadow of death, always there following you closely so you have to keep moving. And one day, when you move too slowly, or sleep for too long, they'll catch up.

"We should probably split up." Dean pants, when they are on the rocky mountains in Colorado. Stones and rocks roll unstably at the horses' feet, falling into the cliff and the creek down below. "Easier to take down three four than having the whole dozen of them chasing us all like Nazgul's."

"I don't know who that is, but sounds like a plan to me." Butch says, frowning to the way they come from. The posse isn't in the view yet, but they all know they're not far behind.

Dean shakes hands with them both.

Butch pats his back. "Take care, brother."

Dean gives him a cowboy salute.

Same with the Sundance Kid.

Dean keeps going north. He doesn't keep track of where Butch and Sundance are going. They might head east now, likely. Kansas is worth a visit and they can probably do those things the papers said they did but they haven't got chance to. Dean thinks, urging the horse to keep up the pace again.

There are more than half a dozen of the posse following him, by the count of the shaky lanterns.

"Damn it." Dean curses under his breath. That's the wrong math, he should get only a third, not like almost all of them.

Don't they want to follow the other two? They should have made a bigger name than already does, according to the history.

But meanwhile, Dean finds himself smirking at the fact if they prefer to follow him, it must mean he has been quite a big deal to whoever recruited them. Then hopefully that's also a big enough of a noise to Cas.

<br>

He rides into a town by the nightfall from the back. The crappy place feels somewhat familiar. The smell of horse dung and sand, the shape of the road and houses along the way.

Dean blinks at the night view of the town, approaching a two-level house that feels most calling. He gets down from the horse and sneaks in after lock picked the door.

And he curses his own stupid mistake.

The sheriff's office where he had briefly been assigned to little more than months ago. The place where the deputy was shot by a phoenix.

He is back to Sunrise, Wyoming. The town he should never come back, considering the demon encounter.

He rushes to the door, and hears long and painful whinny of his horse when a gunshot unmistakably has shot her.

"I'm so sorry, Baby." Dean puts his head on the doorframe for a second, mourning the loss of the creature that has accompanied him day and night for months when no one else did.

More clops sound up outside of the place. Men's rushed footsteps surrounding from all sides. By the sound of all the shouts and yells, some remain on the horsebacks, circling the building in trotting steps, others readying the guns and rifles, the clicks of the safety switch are loud and clear. There are people in the lead shouting something, then some answering voices. He can't hear them clearly but he can't miss the determination in those voices. They would take him down for good, and he has no escape this time.

He wonders briefly if those people are human or demons, then realizes it makes no difference at all -- they would want him dead either way.

Dean looks around the office, already knows for sure there is no secret passageway. He can also fight bloody and ugly, go down swinging just like how the movie shows for the ending of great Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Except there will be no freeze frame for him. This is real life, so he would just become a whole body of gun holes and dead meat. And his mind jumps back to an image of a mourning Cas and a crying Sam, eyes red and swollen for both of them; or worse, an image of Cas beaten up and killed by the archangel, and Sam dying of old age in the western, before twentieth century starts.

No way out, except for flying.

Dean loads all the guns he can find in the place. The pistols and rifles he gathers with him during all these times, some shotguns probably belong to the new sheriff of the town, standing at the back of the office by the wall.

He finds more ammo too, taking them to the sheriff's office desk, just to be prepared.

Finished all these works, he leans against the desk, closes his eyes.

His fingers are tight around the pistols so he can't quite cross them properly in front of his chest, so he settles with putting them on the laps.

"Castiel, please, I need you." Dean thinks, really thinking hard and desperately like never before, picturing his features in his mind like how he would stand in front of him. He hates the bleeding tone of begging in his prayer, but he can't think of another way, so he keeps it going. "At least come get Sammy and make sure he's safe. October the twenty fourth, 1861, Sunrise, Wyoming. Please --"

And then, like a slow motion moment, unmistakably, there is the most beautiful sound of wings fluttering, air stirs. Dean gasps in relief before opening his eyes.

"Cas --" He starts, then stops dead, "Who are you?"

The man in front of him is at least five inches taller than him, wearing uniforms, soldier looking.

The stranger squints at him, and says in a low voice, "You pray too loud. I really don't know why you act like we know each other."

"Castiel," Dean realizes, relieved and tensed at the same time, not sure to smile or glare, so he stares. "I almost forget how big of an asshole you were before."

"As an Angel of the Lord, I come with orders," he declares solemnly. "There are beings who don't belong to this era and constantly disturb the timeline, and I am here to eliminate them. You are one of the three."

"Great, fly me back to my page of the calendar, and problem solved." Dean says, hopefully. Meanwhile -- *Wait, three? Does that mean... Cas? Cas, goddamnit, come in, this is Houston, can you hear me?*

"No, the order is to exterminate the threat to the timeline, not assist them." The Castiel from this timeline raises his hand, eyes start glaring with angelic lights.

Dean dodges aside, having no other way of self defense but to press the trigger. Guns won't do him any harm, but hopefully to distract long enough until he figures out something.

As he dumps the bullets into this Castiel's body, the door is crashed open. He doesn't have time to check if the posse has break through the barricade he sets there, the only thought remains is: *He's gonna die for sure this time*.

Dean's eyes stare at the Angel's, the guns in his hands run out of the bullet, and he doesn't want to take his eyes away to reload. Stepping back step by step until his back is pressed to the wall, he clicks the empty guns, feeling the desperation accumulating so much that it drowns him and squeezed his heart dead even before he gets smitten by Castiel.

And then, the lights in Castiel's eyes start dimming, as if something is forcing him back down. He looks confused and turns around. There is another man behind him in some old farmer's clothes.

Castiel is visibly surprised, with a growling voice, the lights in the room start shaking and blinking, then go out. But the thundering noise rolls louder, and flash of lights shine in the room. Shadow of a large pair of black wings spread in the space. Dean watches in awe, eyes stinging from the brightness of the light, fingers numb by the force it holds on the pistol's handle. He squints the eyes but keeps watching.

The other man is not intimated. In the lights that are too dazzling to see, he lights up too. Blue white light pouring from his eyes, flash and thunder, then the wings.

"Cas." Dean mumbles the name, knowing without doubt it is his Cas, the Cas he has known for three years and been praying to for the whole time when he's in here. Here he is, months late, but finally, here he is.

Cas's lights unsteady for a second at Dean's voice, but stables himself quickly enough. The old-era western Castiel is still here, menacing, hostile. "You're the second one on the list." He says.

Cas doesn't answer, the wings flapping, taking his body higher in the air. Castiel follows him, flying to the ceiling. The sheriff's office is visibly too small for them, but they fight and attack and defend all alone.

For some minutes, Dean thinks his Cas is going to lose. He wrestles and struggles, as if the muscle from his old body is too tired or weak, but then he'd realize, the angels must not fight in the vessel. The bodies are just here as a representation, the real them must be wresting in the dimension he cannot see.

"Cas, come on. This is yourself." Dean wants help so badly, but on the other hand, wouldn't he hurt Cas too if he hurts his older self? He hates timeline dilemma.

He can do nothing but stares and waits. The sounds outside of the building -- if those posse and horses are still there besieging him -- can't be heard anymore, compared to the thunderous sound of the fighting above him.

And then, the fight concludes. Dean's heart thumps to his throat when the lights in the room start going out, and the two bodies fall back to the floor slowly, with one in standing posture, the other horizontal.

"Cas?" Dean blinks hard, trying to get adjusted to the view, trying to see who is the one left standing. Then he sees it.

The one standing is the Cas he knows, in Jimmy Novak's vessel.

His eyes still have glaring angelic lights, his palm pressed on the head of his old self, whose lights are dimming as the grace is extracted and transmitted from the point they touch.

Then the process finishes. Cas leaves that soldier's vessel on the ground. There is no sign of an angel in that nerveless body, no showing of whether the Castiel from this timeline is still in that body or if he's still alive.

Dean stares at him, "Cas?" He gasps, finding his throat choked. "Did you just... kill the other you?"

"No," Cas meets his gaze, and holds it. The familiar stare between them, the one that is soothing, grounding. "I just absorbed the grace I needed, and wiped the memory to avoid any paradox."

Dean gestures the lifeless body uncertainly. "Wouldn't that hurt... you? The old you?"

And Cas answers, tone flat, "He has plenty time to recover, I don't."

"God, you're cruel to yourself." Dean wipes the corner of his eyes, closing the distance between them, wrapping his arms around Cas tight, his chin pressed on his shoulder. "Thank goodness you're here. So good to see you again."

Cas puts his arms around Dean's back, and presses him hard. He swallows, and says quietly, "Hello, Dean."

There is something in his voice gives Dean a shivering chill. He pulls back, still keeping a hand on Cas's shoulder. By the sheer light leaking into the place from outside, he checks Cas up and down, frowning at his farmer's shirt and cowboy's pants. So uncomfortably blended in and human look. He looks more disheveled than Dean ever remembers, dirt and dust cover his face and clothes like he's been on the road for so long that the sand from the wild west has already carved into his skin. The look that belongs to all the cowboys from this era.

Dean looks at him in the eyes, "Where have you been?"

"When." Cas corrects.

"What?" Dean gasps, slow realization falls on him. "How long have you been here?"

"Twenty years."

"Cas --"

"I landed too early, so I have to wait for you to catch up, wait for time to pass in the old, slow way." Cas says, in plain tone.

"I prayed to you, all the time." Dean chokes out.

"I know." Cas's eyes glint with bitterness. "I wish I could get to you sooner."

Dean asks, squeezing his shoulder, to steady himself. "What happened?"

#### Act 1

The ranch they pointed him to belongs to the Ludlow family. The father raises three boys, and there are a family of Indians as helpers.

Cas learns the way of ranch life fast enough, and lives with the stocks for the most of the time. They asked him if he needs a better place to spend the night, and he told them he would be fine. He needed some sleep like humans do for the first two three years, and then it's just long dark nights after nights, alone, outside of the helper's hut, staring at the sky, thinking, wondering. He might has accidentally fallen asleep once in a long while, but the body's need of sleep reduces as the grace grows back slowly -- agonizingly slow, but he doesn't have anything else to do.

The wings recover slower than the rest of the body, and he can't risk using grace to help -- not like there is enough of healing power left anyway -- in case the archangel is still scouting the time flux and noticing the reflecting light from his standout existence that doesn't belong to this era.

So he just lives, and waits. Waiting for the time to pass seconds by seconds, minutes by minutes, like all humans do, like all the history do. Waiting for his body and the true form to recover in the oldest way, like all humans do. Waiting for his strength and grace to grow back.

The little Indian girl grows from a kid to a young lady, then comes of age. The Ludlow boys grow fast too. Cas watches them grow from babbling babies to strong, young men.

The time is a funny thing, it feels one way when they as angels watch the mankind involve from the top of the cloud and thousands of years pass within a snap, and becomes so utterly a differently thing as it flows and moves forward one day after another, then one year after another.

The old man of the Ludlow's family passes away at the fifteenth year after Cas joins the ranch. They host a proper funeral in the traditional way. By nightfall, the oldest son plays harper and the youngest one sings a beautiful song. The second son isn't with them, he's probably in the woods again, looking for bears to fight with.

Cas sits at the corner, away from the bonfire and the family, thinking absent-mindedly that the scene looks too familiar. He thinks about Dean, in moments like this. He wonders where Dean is and if he's safe. He checks the time, then the date, then the year. There are still five years to wait, until 1861 comes.

For the whole year of 1860, Cas is restless. He attends to the cows, feeds the chickens and pigs, cleans up the stable, brushes the horses, and then, with all the work done, he goes into the woods for a walk. That's what he tells the Ludlows.

He doesn't just take a walk in the woods, he goes far deep east. Across the east side of the state line, he goes to South Dakota. He goes to the land where the town of Sioux Falls would be, and he goes to the place where Bobby's house and yard would be. The place they leave behind, and the place that hasn't been built. The lands are undeveloped yet. Cas would just stay here, standing on the spot the memory tells him should be the right spot, lowering the body, touching the sand and dirt on the ground, wondering if those exact dirt remains the same for the whole one hundred and fifty years into the future. The solid ground gives him a tiniest sense of comfort. But the human heart in his body still bumps restlessly, he knows the rings in his true form would be spinning with a similar uneasy speed.

He goes back to the ranch after that. The sun of the next day doesn't rise yet. He goes back to check the stable and the fences, the family in the house, and the Indian family in the helper's hut. The next day is no difference.

And then, finally, the year of 1861 comes, the month of March comes. On the day of March the fourth, 1861, the day he knows Dean and Sam would be in the Sunrise, Wyoming, because he would -- had -- dropped them here. Cas goes back to the town, waiting, out of their sight -- things that would have happened to the brothers, Cas doesn't know what would happen if he disturbs the time flow twice, so he decides, it should be safer to avoid the whole paradox by showing up only after when he is supposed to show.

He goes into the saloon, before the noon of the fourth. The bartender Jim Elkins regards him as he walks in. The young man he once was turns aged and bearded, but the eyes are still sharp. The place smells like horse dung and hay now.

"I remember you." He tells Cas. "You look exactly the same as twenty years ago."

Cas gives him a quick smile. "You have good memory."

The man looks proud of himself.

Cas books a room with the ranch salary he earned in the past years, with all the extras to pay for those very first few days he was here last time.

He stays on the second floor and decides to not leave the room until the high noon of the fifth.

When the footsteps of Dean and Sam walk into the place, when their voices pass to the second floor, it takes him everything to not rushing downstairs to meet them.

Cas sits on the bed, closing his eyes, breathing in and out, deep, counting his own heartbeat. He hears Dean complaining about the drink, and saying his own name being "Clint Eastwood". He clenches the fist, pinning his body down, reminding himself, *he has waited for twenty years, he can wait for another day*.

The Judge yells in pain when the phoenix creature burns him and the saloon girl screams. The Winchester brothers dash to the second floor. Cas snaps open his eyes. Dean's voice is right next door to his room. He's hidden from his angelic eyes, and the wall blocks his human eyes. He can't see him, but every atom in his body and every photon in his true form vibrates in anticipation. He is right there.

Cas thinks he might break the bones in his fist if he clenches any harder.

Every syllable coming from Dean, every word and sentence, Cas listens to them, and absorbs into his memory. He doesn't realize how much he misses it. And he doesn't even know it's possible to miss like this, it almost terrifies him.

He holds himself still, and he hears them leave the room.

The night comes and goes. When the sun rises, a sense of unease starts crawling up. A shade of evil looms this place, and Cas opens his true eyes to scout.

Elkins enters his room without knock, and he sees a demon's face behind the vessel.

Cas rushes up, manifesting his angel blade into the palm. Two more demons crowd into the room, both taking the form of the saloon ladies, another two wait in the hallway.

He swings the blade at the one possessing the poor bartender, the demon smirks harshly, "Careful, don't want to hurt the old sir in here, he's still awake." The eyes of the demon flash back to human for a second, the bartender looks at him in frantic confusion and panic, and then they switch back to demon's black eyes.

Fighting the demons while trying to not harm the human vessels is like disarming a bomb that is tied to a beating heart.

Cas hides the angel blade away in the pocket dimension, maneuvering between the demons, murmuring the exorcism in Latin. It's been a while since last time he sees a demon, let alone fighting one. The easy pace of ranch life has made him slack. The words stumble and demons catch him off guard.

They trap him in the Enochian trap painted on the floor, and weaken him with more sigils on the wall. He can do nothing but scowl. He would have been able to break free if he's at his full power, but at the slow rate of recovery, he is no match.

This is a moment Cas wishes Dean can hear him like he hears his prayer.

He hears Dean's voice, talking with Sam.

He hears sound of the gunshot, and phoenix burning to ashes.

And he hears the clock bells the tone of the high noon.

Cas struggles, but the trap and sigils render him powerless.

Dean's voice comes through in prayer, calling his name, for the many days followed. Cas hates himself for can't be there when he needs him.

He breaks free when a fire tears down the whole place. The flames catches his clothes on fire, and threatens to burn his vessel. Cas manages to jump out of the window, landing on some bushes. Leaving only scratches on the skin.

The road has a fresh track of horse's hooves. The way that Dean leaves. Leading to a place he doesn't know where.

Cas finds a horse with no owner, and follows the track toward west.

<br>

#### Act 2

More than ever, Cas misses the human invention of phones. He doesn't like many of the things they call advanced techniques in the last century, but the existence of phone does make one's life so much easier.

Especially when it comes to the people that are hidden from all angels.

Cas would follow the track to where the horse marks disappear into water or bushes, and search the land for hours after hours with no outcome.

Then Dean's prayer would come through, echoing in his brain like a one-direction phone line where he can only listen but no way to answer.

He misses the times when he can just dial his number and ask "Dean, where are you".

Even though, Dean doesn't always seem pleased to see him dropping by. He complains a lot, especially if it's during his sleep time. But Cas decides, it's just how the human is, and he misses that too.

<br>

He loses Dean's track somewhere near the state line between Utah and Arizona. No new bank get robbed for a while around the area, Cas goes back to the last town he knows Dean has visited -- Pinecrest, Utah.

A wanted poster with a sketch of Dean's profile is newly attached outside of the bank's door, under the name of Clint Eastwood.

Cas stands there staring at the image. The sketch isn't accurate, the stubbles and freckles are wrong, but the eyes are vivid. He looks into the eyes, having a weird feeling that the eyes have their own lives and can see through him knowing all the dirty little secrets that are eating him up.

Cas shifts uneasily, but he can't take his eyes away. His look follows the jawline of his figure, and the shape of his nose, landing back to the eyes that are black and white on the image. He thinks about the emerald color of his eyes.

One of the guards of the bank walks out asking if he has seen the man.

Cas blinks once, and says no.

"He's actually charming as an outlaw," the guard recalls, "very polite." He shows him his wrist, where there is nothing to see. "See? They didn't even tie me up."

Cas can't hold back a small smile, and tells the guard, "I heard they are good men."

The guard nods once, and moves back to the bank.

Cas tears down the poster when no one sees, and takes it with him.

<br>

He learns to check the newspapers to find new updates of "Clint Eastwood" and his gangs.

Though after a while he realizes it is always either outdated or fake.

A bank is reported to be robbed in Rattlesnake Bend, Nevada. Cas rides into the town, but the town is safe and sound from any robbery for over a month now.

He doubts Dean would ever kill anyone if they're not monsters, but when the newspaper says Clint Eastwood has shown up in Cattle Creek, Kansas with a headcount, he still goes there to check it out, just in case.

It is near the end of the summer, Kansas is still hot and dry. People in the town wears ridiculously large cowboy hat to cover the sun. The saloon is called Skinny's Saloon. The man behind the bar counter is exactly as the name suggests.

Cas approaches him to ask if there is a cowboy of his height and green eyes ever visited. Skinny raises a pistol at him as soon as he hears the question.

Cas tilts his head at the man's reaction, wondering what is it that he got wrong.

"Who are you?" Skinny demands, "His friend or enemy?" He holds the pistol in the right hand, the left hand falling limp and shaky by his side, that side of shoulder twitching uncontrollably.

Cas considers, and he says, "Nobody. I just want to find him." At the man's doubtful eyes, Cas manages to add, "He is wanted, isn't it? There are posters about him."

Skinny lowers his gun and huffs a laughter, "Ah, bounty hunter."

Cas nods at that, "So? Is he here or not?"

Skinny says, with much disappointment. "He's not. I'd hope he'd come visit once he sees the paper, but he never does."

"You want to trick him here? Why?" Cas squints. This man is not a demon, but who says demons have to come from hell.

Skinny points at his wounded left shoulder. "Thunderhill, Colorado. That bastard puts a bullet in here." He grinds the teeth. "Ever heard about cowboy's revenge? This ain't over until he's dead."

"You're going to kill him?" Cas tenses.

"Sure I do." Skinny smirks, "If no one else did it before me."

Cas stands up, leaning on the counter, speaking one word at a time, dead serious. "I can't let you do that."

"What, because you want all the bounty to yourself? Go ahead kill him first then." Skinny looks at him carelessly. "Or do you want to settle it the old way?"

Cas wants to ask what old way, but glancing down, he sees the man already picks up the pistol again, pointing in his direction. He gets it easily.

"Old way, then." He says gloomily.

They take the fight outside.

Noon time, main street. There are people watching.

Cas had his gun belt back when he's three states before, because he realized people tend to ask more questions if he doesn't have one.

His fingers hover at the outskirt of the gun, his eyes looking straight at the eyes of the skinny cowboy. The cowboy is sweating heavily.

For a second, Cas feels bad for him, but the next second, he remembers his tone of hatred when he said "Sure I do" about killing Dean.

Cas's eyes cool to icy. He draws the gun and shoots the man in the chest. The man barely has chance to take his gun out and already fall to the ground dead.

Cas puts the gun back to the holster. Not liking the way the crowd looks at him, as if he's some kind of hero. He just killed a man, he thinks bitterly, though he has to.

He leaves Kansas quickly.

The gun is pressed to his thigh, still feeling hot. Cas wonders if Dean would have to kill any man during this western times.

<br>

#### Act 3

The town in California is also a fool's errand. The mine that is said to be robbed, they never has any gold to begin with. Upon Cas's very persuasive query, the mine owner admits it's just a way to keep the miners' mind in peace.

"Clint Eastwood is just a convenient name to put." The man murmurs.

"And why is that?"

"Oh because he's gonna die soon, we can just say the gold is gone with him." The mine owner shrugs. "The railway companies have been recruiting the best men to join a posse to go after him and his gang. They have the best trackers that can find any man in the whole world like a rabbit in a hole. Think the railway can't take any more robbery loss now."

Cas scowls at the news and lets the man go. "Where can I find this posse?"

"Try Thunderhill, Colorado. Heard the sheriff there volunteered. Probably a personal grudge."

The town name rings a bell. Didn't that skinny bartender and saloon owner say he's from the same place?

Cas rushes the horse as he rides across the land toward Colorado, wondering just how much trouble Dean has got himself into back in Colorado.

<br>

Cas finds the posse the night before they head out. The town sheriff Little Bill is counting the head. They are one person short of a dozen, so Cas makes to the last spot.

Little Bill tells them a story at the saloon many months ago, and how ruthless Clint Eastwood was when he murders men and humiliates women. The story sounds nothing like Dean, but everyone in the posse gets so inspired they all shouts damnation to this Clint Eastwood they've never met and eager to head out hunting the man down.

Cas wants nothing but yell at these men, telling them how wrong they are and how misleading those stories are. But then he would for sure get kicked out of the posse with no way of finding Dean again, all while a group of cowboys hunting him down like hounds chasing hares.

He bites on his own lips to not show any sign of disapproval.

"You with us, Novak? Hunt the man down and kill him by all means?" Little Bill stares at him when he doesn't jump up and down like the others.

Cas forces a quick smile and nods. "Yes, by all means."

<br>

The Indian trackers are indeed exceptional in keeping up with the tracks.

Sometimes when there are absolutely no track to his eyes, both his human eyes and true eyes, the Indians can still give them clear directions to go.

They pick up the days old trace from Nevada, moving to south east, then following all the way to New Mexico.

Cas thinks he catches a glimpse of three horses on top of the mountain, hundreds of miles away. One of the figures is so familiar that his heart skips a beat. But when they reach that spot, the men are another hundreds of miles away again, like a flyaway mirage.

Cas wonders if he's hallucinating their figures.

They keep moving. So are them.

When they are back to Colorado, the Indians tell Little Bill the traces are split into two ways.

The sheriff curses. "They must separated."

Cas asks, "Which way has less people?"

The Indians point the way to the north.

Cas urges his horse toward the pointed direction. "I'm going that way." He states, quietly hoping the group could also split, and that less would choose to follow Dean.

Which, of course, turns out one's wish is never granted, as their luck always go.

<br>

As the hint of winter closing in, they follow the trace to the town in Wyoming.

Cas recognizes the town the moment they roll in. Sunrise, Wyoming, where all the messes start. He never thought he'd be back here again. The saloon house has been rebuilt in the past months. No sign to show the old one has been burnt down in a fire.

Dean gets cornered in the sheriff's office. Flickering lights show his silhouette on and off, switching between windows. Cas watches him, thinking this is the closest they've ever been since last time they were both in this town.

Dean's prayer reaches him, pained and desperate, asking for him. With the distance so close, they can probably hear each other if they just speak loud enough.

Cas gets off the horse, and tells the sheriff he'll go in there first. Alone.

Little Bill eyes him. "He'll shoot you like a walking sieve."

Cas answers plainly. "Maybe he will, maybe he won't."

Little Bill regards him closely, up and down, as if taking his shabby clothing and his look in for the first time. "You know him, don't you? That's why you want to join, probably never even thought about killing him for once. A lover?"

Cas keeps his face stoic, standing still. Keeping his eyes on the sheriff's office. Dean's prayer continues, so half his attention is taken away from the conversation before him.

The man smirks, reaching for his gun, swinging casually at him. "Maybe you're just making all our lives easier, we can lure him out without a fight."

The rest of the posse starts moving toward him. The men and the horses circle around him.

"Don't." Cas warns them, jaws tights, eyes flashing between them and where Dean is.

They laugh, shrinking the circle, facing away from the sheriff's office.

There is a sudden burst of glaring light from inside the sheriff's office, the air vibrates with electricity. At the very same moment, guns go off, and Dean's prayer hitches.

Cas turns around sharp, drawing his gun at the posse. They draw theirs, firing at the same time.

Bullets hit him, back and leg and arm, warm blood streaming down, but Cas keeps standing, continues the shooting. The other men are surprised, soon terrified. Some of them see the wounds that would for sure kill a man but not even slow him down, they rise to the horses and want to run. Cas shoots their legs and they fall to the ground in loud moaning, until no men leaves standing.

Little Bill falls from his horse too, crawling desperately with a wounded leg, as Cas walks toward him, pointing a gun to his face. The man widens his eyes in horror. Cas pulls the trigger, he flinches violently. But the gun is blank. Cas pulls it again, he flinches again. For three times, Cas watches the horror growing in the man, shaking like a leaf in the winter gust. He throws the empty gun at him, then hurries toward the sheriff's office.

The barricaded door is easy to break, the light inside the room is blinding to any human. But for Cas, the shapes are familiar. One belongs to Dean, the other his old self.

Dean is on the ground, backing up, holding himself, both of the guns in his hand are out of bullets. His old self is preparing for a deadly strike.

Cas tears him away from Dean, unfolding his own true forms. The wings are barely healed, the new bullet wounds slow his vessel down, but Dean is here. If he loses, it would mean his old self, if keep following the order as he knew he would, is going to kill Dean. *He*, would be the one who causes Dean's death. And Cas can't allow that happen.

He fights like there is no future, and his old self is no match. Drinking in his own grace, he knows his past self would be wounded for decades maybe centuries, but he's here, now, no memory of this encounter, which means there is no consequence that is too severe to bear. He drains his past self and wipes the memory, sending him back to Heaven.

Like he tells Dean, his past self has the luxury of healing slowly, he doesn't.

The new grace he absorbed heal himself well, both the body and the true form grow strong and complete.

Cas turns to Dean, finally. Finally.

*It's been a long time.* He thinks, breathing out long and relieved. *You have no idea how long it has been. And I finally find you.*

He says none of that, only to hold the man tight, with all his forces but careful enough not to break him.

Dean's breath is uneven over his shoulder. They hold each other like that, just to breathe together, in the same space, in the same time, one hundred and fifty years too early, hundreds of thousand of miles too far. And yet, they are at ease.

Breathing in, breathing out. The warm and solid touch under the hands. The bone, the muscle, the skin; the hair, the stubble, the freckles.

Cas scrutinizes him once they pull apart. The face and look that is all so familiar, but the long beard and the new wrinkles crimpled by the western sand and wind make the face new and mature. The eyes trained on his, sparkling with glitters.

Eventually, Cas decides, all he can say is just, "Hello, Dean."

### Chap.7 (reunion, go home)(Sunrise+Bobby's, 1861+2011, Dean POV+Cas)

> **Outline:** Cas heals Dean and himself, Dean caring, Cas only hints the last 20y are tough but not enough detail (some talk, Dean's imagined ranch life with Cas)
>
> Cas flies them home (pick Sam up), back to the same day they leave for the phoenix's ashes. Bobby is still there, exactly the same as before, everything the same. (Or not exactly, Dean's western fame gets kept in history, legends of himself becomes a cowboy story, exaggerated but he's amused, secretly really love it)

The sound of his last question dangles in the air, floating there for a few extended seconds, then falling gradually to the ground like a flying feather drifting down.

*What happened, Cas?* Dean's eyes match his, can't help wondering how many things these eyes have seen in the last twenty years -- how many beautiful things, and how many ugly things.

Cas is quiet. Too quiet. With the eyes too deep and blue, swirling like ocean water.

*Tell me, please.* Dean thinks hard, seeing Cas's eyes widen slightly, realizing the thought must have been conveyed through the prayer accidentally.

"It's... not easy." Cas murmurs, voice husky and reluctant. "But it's gone now, so it doesn't matter." His eyes flicker to outside of the door. Some outlines of dead and wounded men can be seen from where they stand. Moon light is bright tonight.

"No, it matters." Dean tells him, voice adamant. "It matters to me."

It's a long telling. From the day they left Bobby's place till now. It almost feels like a life time ago. That life where they fight another apocalypse and asshole demons and archangels, feels like a long dream that is slowly fading in the memory while this one, the wild lands, the gang Dean befriended with for months, the ranch Cas worked in for years, this feels so real now.

Cas finishes his story, and Dean finishes telling him his. They let the aftertaste stretch on the tip of the tongue.

"It's a difficult life." Dean says slowly.

Cas nods quietly.

They are sitting by the sheriff's desk now, pulling the two chairs close, their knees touching. Dean's fingers absent-mindedly fumble with the new sheriff's pin on the desk -- whoever it belongs now.

"But also a simple one." He says, remembering the vast landscape in front of him, infinite. The edge of the ocean can't be seen from there. On the horseback, on this land, he is free.

"The life in the ranch is also simple." Cas says. "Quiet. Too quiet you might find it boring. That's probably why old Ludlow's second son has to go into the woods looking for bears to fight."

Dean chuckles, "Sounds like someone I'd like to meet."

Cas smiles with him, "Yes, I think you'll like him. You'll like all of them."

Quietness fall between them again. Calm and comfortable. They just sit there, with only moonlight filtering through broken windows and the door.

They're not eager to go anywhere, or any time. They've spent too long to get to this point, at least earned a moment to take a breath.

Dean's mind wanders to the ranch in Cas's words. He doesn't need to see the place to know it must be something Cas would enjoy. The livestock and the wild lives, the creatures and the woods. The growing up kids, girls and boys growing to be become fine ladies and gentlemen -- or wild girls and uncivilized hunters, if they choose to.

They can live there, own a small hut of their own, take possession of a small corner of the ranch. They can attend to the ranch then watch sunset from the porch. The air would smell like wood and grass, their hands gnarled from farm work instead of gun shot. Dean blinks hard, thinking, *that doesn't even sound half bad*. Sam is welcome to stay, or find another ranch of his own with someone he enjoys to spend time with. They can just live normal, quiet lives, and probably die of boredom, or old age, or too much healthy natural food, some time around the corner of the twentieth century. He finds himself doesn't mind that they would not even live to the day that Impala is produced or the day Led Zeppelin starts their touring. With Cas, and Sam, safe and happy and with him, there isn't much else to ask for. Dean smiles.

"What are you thinking?" Cas breaks the silence.

"I might miss this place." Dean tells him.

"We don't have to go." Cas offers, genuinely.

"I know." But Dean already starts standing up from the seat, holding out a hand to pull Cas to his feet too.

He reaches for the glass of phoenix's ash that has been tucked inside his inner pocket. Shaking it to show the content, making his point clear. "We came here for this, and we got it. The world back home still needs saving. Don't want to keep Bobby waiting for too long, do we?"

Cas nods, then chews his tongue. Dean eyes him. Cas sighs deep, "There is something I should have let you know a long time ago. I have twenty years to think it over, and time does have the magic to clear one's mind."

The wild land of the west is plain and straightforward, so it is how it makes them. No more lies, no more secrets. No more hide and seek, no more chase and run.

Cas confesses, the deal with the demon, the war with the archangel, the messy things among angels, the friends and enemies, all the concerns and worries, all the things he thought he can contain in his head, they flood out under the moonlight in the wild west land, in front of Dean's eyes.

The wind and sand hear them, the night is long and quiet.

Cas breathes out, waiting for a furious blow. Only to find Dean's look intense, but not angry.

"We'll figure this out, together." He says. Then, "Now lets pick Sam up and go home first."

<br>

So they do.

They find Sam in Samuel's place, the two of them are adding extra sigils to the hut. They argue a lot, just like all the familiar bickering with Bobby. The squabbles are sour and bitter, but funny in its own way. Their heads leaning close over a sigil on one of the books, immediately start arguing the correct interpretation. They paint the symbol together, doing some ritual and magical experiments. Unsurprised to see it not working. Then they move on to test the next theory. The bottle of whiskey on Samuel's writing desk is emptied, there are two glasses there.

Sam hates to leave as much as back when he was still at school and Dean or their dad had to tell him they're moving again.

Sam purses his mouth as his protest, patting Samuel on the shoulder at the time of farewell.

The old legendary hunter pats him back on the same spot. Not saying anything, but standing by the hut's door, waving.

Dean almost feels bad for him.

They are back at Bobby's place in a blink. Land on the date of April the twenty fifth, 2011. Minutes after Cas woke up from Bobby's couch and flew away from the place.

"So the time dimension this round, it's easy to fly?" Dean murmurs low and only Cas can hear, as their feet touch the ground again.

"Yes." Cas nods by his side. "Raphael isn't there anymore."

Dean is relieved, turning to hug Bobby so tight that makes the old hunter grumbles.

"Alright, alright, sappy," Bobby pats his back a few times, "no need to grow girl parts, it's just three days."

"Oh." Dean stills, remembering that's true for him.

Bobby looks exactly the same as before, as he should. So is this room, or the state, or the world. Except for them.

Bobby takes them in -- Dean has long, cowboy's beard and wrinkles from dry wind and sand; Sam changes the least, only with longer and messier hair; and Cas, almost totally a new different being, with his over human-like ranch and cowboy clothing, and the weather-beaten look in his eyes. Bobby squints at them, "You better tell me everything."

So they do.

<br>

Then, the old life comes back. The old demon-hunting, monster-killing life Dean's grown up with. They make plans, they hunt down Eve, they deal with Crowley, they look for ways to handle Raphael. They work on saving the world every other Tuesdays.

Sam jumps right back into the old routine as if the months in the Wild West have never left a mark in his memory, but Dean thinks, in between the monster-hunting and the world-saving, when he exchanges the looks with Cas, he knows something is never the same ever again.

Sometimes in the night, when he lies in the motel bed, staring at the ceiling, wide awake, he finds it easy to imagine the current life a dream, the memory a reality. They could have all still been in the Wild West, and the whole world-saving thing is just one long dream to wake up from.

He might as well be laying in a saloon room in an old town, cowboys on horses noisy down the floor, the smell of animal feces mixed with saloon ladies' perfumes filling the air, music passing through the thin wooden walls.

He could still feel the wind from the old western time blows his hair, the land vast and the world open to explore. Dean allows himself imagine the life they never have: Cas in the ranch, busy and happy, wearing a cowboy hat; they sit at the corner of a saloon on Friday nights, listening to town folks playing the old time music, dancing and singing, happy and peaceful. All the time, Cas by his side. He breathes, feeling the air calm and easy, the smell of dust is the taste of raw nature and freedom.

A life they never have, but an option always open. That night, in the moonlight, in the quiet moment, when he looks Cas in the eyes, Dean knows the answer to an unasked question, would be yes. He knows.

*What if we just, stay. Here and now. Us.*

A life in the past, can be their future.

The one thing they always want, is the one thing they could have.

Dean breathes slow and deep, closing his eyes in the quiet night.

Maybe they will, *one day*. When all is done, maybe they will.

They will have a banjo, Cas will have a harp. The music will be beautiful, so is the dance. People will be laughing, they will be holding each other close, enjoying the moment. The comfortable wind of the Wild West flow gently by. They will hold each other's eyes, so close they could see their own reflections. Cas will look at him like there is nothing else in the world, the way he always did. Dean thinks his own eyes might just be the same.

They will be happy, content. Home.

Dean decides, he wants nothing more.

He falls into sleep with a quiet smile.

###### draft notes

(Or not exactly, Dean's western fame gets kept in history, legends of himself becomes a cowboy story, exaggerated but he's amused, secretly really love it)

Major rewrites!! don't like it, too emotionally remote and abrupt, and spoil the future events → pretend only knows so far until S06E18, but give hopeful ending that *maybe* when all is done, that's the thing they can have, there will be peace in the end
