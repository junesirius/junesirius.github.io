**Summary:**

The plan was simple -- get the phoenix's ashes and get out. But when do things ever go easy for them? High noon comes and goes, and Dean finds himself stranded in the Wild West with no way home -- and no sign of Cas.

Castiel fights hard. Time is fluid and never easy to navigate, especially with his grace bleeding out and an archangel on his tail. The sign of Sunrise, Wyoming is finally in sight, but Dean is not here.

The past is vast, the clock is slow -- they're taking the long way home.

**Preview Snippet:**

"So, you boys finally decided to move on?" Elkins eyes their looks.

Dean has a red bandana wrapped around his mouth, Sam a black one. They've changed into new shirts and pants -- new for them, old for the clothes -- dirt and stains making them look exactly like the rest of the folks in the place.

The look of a pilgrim, Dean realizes.

He doesn't nod or shake. Just strides straight into the room, heading directly for the bartender they've grown familiar with over the past few days. Dean lets out a breath, tasting a tad of bitterness lingering on the tip of his tongue.

Drawing the pistol from the holster at his waist in a smooth swing, he fires three shots into the ceiling. Some girls scream behind him, he knows Sam must also have his gun drawn, aimed somewhere.

Elkins looks at him, reaching for something underneath the bar stand. Supposedly a shotgun.

"I wouldn't suggest that." Dean shifts his aim toward him. The bartender stops moving, hands slowly rising.

"What's this about?" The old man is still surprisingly calm, not even showing much curiosity.

Just how many gangsters has he run into before? Dean finds himself wondering.

"What every outlaw around here wants," he says, aiming for a deep, grave voice. "You got any hidden treasure around here? Gold would do too."

"At least leave me a name to pass your story along?" Elkins reaches for a side drawer. The gold he offers includes some of the very pieces they paid for their meals over the past few days. Dean has to push down the unease.

"Eastwood. Clint Eastwood. Best gunner in the western world," Dean tells him.

**Updated posting preview snippet**

"So, you finally decide to move on?" Elkins gives him a once-over.

Dean has a red bandana wrapped around his mouth. He's changed into a new shirt and pants -- new for him, old for the clothes -- dirt and stains making him look exactly like the rest of the folks in the place.

*The look of a pilgrim,* Dean realizes.

He doesn't answer. Just strides straight into the room, heading directly for the bartender they've grown familiar with over the past couple of days. Dean lets out a breath, tasting a tad of bitterness lingering on the tip of his tongue.

Drawing the pistol from the holster at his waist in a smooth swing, he fires three shots into the ceiling. Some girls scream behind him.

Elkins looks at him, reaching for something hidden beneath the bar stand. Supposedly a shotgun.

"I suggest not." Dean shifts his aim toward him. The bartender stops moving, hands slowly rising.

"What's this about?" The old man is still surprisingly chill, not even showing much curiosity.

*Just how many gangsters has he run into before?* Dean finds himself wondering.

"What every outlaw around here wants," he says, aiming for a deep, grave voice. "You got any hidden treasure around here? Gold would do too."

"At least leave me a name to pass your story along?" Elkins slowly reaches for a side drawer in his gaze. The gold he offers includes some of the very pieces they paid for their meals over the past few days. Dean has to push down the unease.

"Eastwood. Clint Eastwood. Best gunner in the western world," Dean tells him, with a mocking smile.

### Loophole fix

If Cas is already in Sunrise Wyoming on 1861.3.5, then why he isn't there when Dean prays for him?

(time travel loophole -> learn from HP3 to fix)

Cas POV: Cas backtracks to 20y ago, lives and waits, then 1861.3.5 comes, Cas arrives in saloon earlier than Dean, witnesses Sheriff burned by the phoenix Elias Finch, hiding to prevent paradox, jump attacked & trapped by demons (the one possess Elkins), so can't get to Dean until the day he burns the place down, Cas free but Dean already rides away, Cas try chase him around but can't catch up, find Dean become wanted, join posse to follow him (also persuade people don't shoot him), Dean runaway from posse, until Dean confronted by 1861!Cas, Cas catch up, fight/blast the old self away, use power to heal Dean (wounded by 1861!Cas), low energy again; can't carry both, fly Sam back first, spit blood when fly back to Dean, collapsed, the two stay in ranch waiting for Cas recover (a bit domestic life), 1y later Cas fly them back to the same day

Dean POV: Cas doesn't come after they pray, start messing around making noise, attacked by demon possessed Elkins, burn place down, leave Sunrise Wyoming; help saloon lady from unjust verdict (bounty hunter, "Unforgiven"), rob bank & train ("Butch Sundance"), chased by railway company posse, start running, so never meet Cas; cornered by posse one night, desperately pray to Castiel, 1861!Cas comes, align with Cas POV afterwards

Sam POV: follow Dean around, Cas fly him back first, Dean&Cas follow immediately, thought it's the same moment, but actually time passed for them a lot longer

(the time they're apart -> fast-forward quickly, a quick sketch, only mention what happened in a series of montage (newspaper clips), tell each other once they met again)

### Edit note

~~keep Sam out of picture from beginning, only Dean travel alone and make noise, Sam stay at Samuel's place all the time~~

~~passing line: Dean hates he can't use cellphone, really want to have a call to make sure people he care about are safe~~ (give the line to Cas)

~~Chap.7: Major rewrites, don't like it, too emotionally remote and abrupt, and spoil the future events → pretend only knows so far until S06E18, but give hopeful ending that *maybe* when all is done, that's the thing they can have, in the end~~

~~(phrasing) saloon girls: "with practiced cheer"~~

Add an epilogue? follow-up of Butch Sundance, potential change to the movie? a passing line that mentioned "Eastwood"? Butch's POV? destiel's movie night and that's how they find out? Dean finds his own sketch in the movie? follow-up of Little Bill? to show they didn't make much disturbance to the history but Dean did make a name for himself as cowboy and he liked it

## Main

### Chap.1-1 (Dean stuck in Sunrise)(Sunrise, 1861, Dean+Sam)

> **Outline:** Dean&Sam gets phoenix's ash by noon, bell rings, but Cas doesn't come, they can't get back. Some more time passes, they realize something must have happened to Cas and now they get stuck in the Frontierland and have to figure out what to do. They start living like the locals, blend in as cowboys, get used to it, Dean is the town sheriff.

Eyes unblinking, gun raised, not for a split second does Dean think he might be too slow. Then the sound of the gunshot echoes, the phoenix burns with bright golden light, and turns into a pile of ashes.

He still gets this. Dean beams to himself.

The clock bells the tone of high noon, the sound shaking him out of the mist of contentment.

"Dean! The ashes!" Sam yells behind him, following by several steps.

Dean dashes to the ashes, glass bottle ready in head, tip opened. The ashes fill into the bottle before the minute ends.

He lets out a breath, regarding the glassful of ashes, shaking the bottle slightly, checking it out in content before closing the lid. Right on time. Mission complete.

The minute passes. No stir in the air.

Dean glances back at Sam, both frowning.

The hands on the wall clock are ticking.

"Where's Cas?" Sam voices the question on his mind, hesitant, uneasy.

Dean gives him a tight smile, checking the clock again. Five minutes have passed. "Dude might be busy," he says weakly. "Give him another minute."

Castiel does not show up in the next minute, or the next five. Or ten.

Dean starts pacing, looking at the sky, half praying, half just speaking to the empty air in front of him. "Hey Cas? Forget to check the watch or something? Time to pick us up."

He looks around. The town is still the western town they spent the last twenty four hours in: Sunrise, Wyoming. Not Bobby's place, definitely not Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Something is not right.

"Dean," Sam says slowly, pointing out the obvious. "Cas is never late for anything."

"He has wings. He can literally fly to any time anywhere, 'cause he'd never be late for anything," Dean says, staring at the clock with even more attention than he had with the phoenix during the duel, as if the solution is somehow hanging on the tip of one metal clock hand.

"Then why do you think...?" Sam doesn't have to finish his sentence.

"I don't know." Dean forces out a breath, pushing down the unease in his gut. "Let's just wait inside. Maybe he'll come just in a bit."

<br>

They sit by the sticky bar table in the Saloon. Elkins pours them each a glass of beer -- still tasting like horse piss, but Dean manages to let it slide down his throat. If he has to stay here longer, might as well start getting used to it.

"You boys alright?" Elkins eyes them while cleaning a glass with a piece of brown yellow rag god knows has been used for how long.

Dean swallows the liquid. "Yeah, yeah," he says, forcing a smile. "Just waiting for a friend to come by."

"Someone late for the date night?" the bartender reads his face, half joking.

"You can say that." Dean's too lazy to retort.

<br>

The saloon has some bar food too, they use it for dinner.

The night soon falls on them. There is still no sign of Cas.

"You want to, umm," Sam shifts on the stool next to him, "-- get a room for the night?" He nods at the wooden "Room" sign hanging under the saloon's signboard.

Dean checks his watch. It's been ten hours.

He empties the glass and stands up. "Yeah ok, let's go." Then adds, "But not here."

"What's wrong with here?"

Dean's eyes sweep through the saloon girls gathering and giggling around the base of the staircase, the sounds of cheap beds shaking are remotely audible from upstairs. His gaze lands back on Sam, raising his eyebrows that can speak by themselves: *Serious?*

Sam hums. "Good point."

They go back to the sheriff's office. With both the sheriff and the deputy down, that place is just a whole big empty room waiting to be claimed.

Dean leads them back inside. The deputy's charred skeleton is still behind the bar, the air still smelling of burnt flesh. Dean decides not to think about that for now. He wanders around the place, looking for anything available to claim for their use.

"You seem to fit the place well enough," Sam observes.

Dean gives him a look, fingering the sheriff's pin on his shirt. "You kidding me? I'm officially the sheriff in town, so yeah, this is legitimately my place now, 'course I fit in here."

"Not just in here," Sam waves his hands, gesturing vaguely. "Everything -- the shirt, the duel, the horse. People might actually buy that you're from this time, which, of course, is a good thing."

Slow understanding starts to kick in. Dean looks up from the lost-and-found bucket he's been scrounging through, squinting at him, "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying," Sam pauses, meeting his eyes, considering the words carefully, "we might have to stay here for quite some time, might as well blend in."

"No, no," Dean straightens up. "Cas is going to be here shortly. Maybe not tonight-short, but tomorrow or something. He -- he won't keep us waiting for too long."

If he says it with enough confidence, he can convince himself too, right?

"Then how long?" Sam pulls a mocking smile. "You don't even believe it yourself."

Dean breaks the gaze, impatient. "So what? You think Cas's just gonna dump us in here? In the middle of the wild, right on the edge of the Civil War?"

"Thought you'd like that," Sam says, easing around, grabbing a chair to sit down. "Isn't it your dream life? Since like six?"

"What? No!" Sam raises an eyebrow. Dean is muted for a second, frowning at him. "Yeah? I mean -- not like this!"

He trails off, giving their surroundings a closer look. The bars, the officer's wooden desk, a couple of lousy chairs, the walls with peeling paper, some random jacket and whip or something scattered around, rifles and shotguns standing in the corner. The air smells of dust and horse.

"Not like this." He lands on it, going back to check the drawers under the desk. "Cas will come, I assure you. Just give him a bit of time. He'll come. He always does."

"What if he can't? What if something happened to him, and he's... he's too weak to time travel, or even dead?"

"Don't say that!" Dean snaps, jerking his head up from behind the desk, glaring at his brother. "Nothing's gonna happen to him, alright? Dude gets his full power back, new and improved, and he's leading a full army Upstairs! Must be just in the middle of war-prep meeting or something." He glances at the ceiling reflexively, as if he could see Heaven like that.

"I'm just being realistic," Sam defends in a calm but worried voice. "Why else would he be late? We both know he's in a war and Raphael is on his tail. And we have no idea how bad things are with his war, I mean, not really. That lieutenant angel, Rachel or something? Said they're in a serious situation, didn't she? Balthazar said something similar before, some bad position. We didn't even ask how bad."

"Cas is fine." That's all Dean can think to say. He swallows, closing his eyes for a second then reopening them. He doesn't know that, but that's the only thing he can say. The only thing he has to hold on to. "He survived so many apocalypses before, surely Raphael can't be worse than Lucifer, right?"

He doesn't mean to bring up the Lucifer thing, that time no more than a year ago when Cas was face to face with *both* Michael and Lucifer, right before he got exploded by the Devil. Dean flinches at the memory. The power of an archangel has always been just an expression in his mind that he doesn't give much thought to, but what if...

He shakes his head, dragging himself away from that train of thought. "We don't know anything, so let's not freak ourselves out just thinking about the worst, eh? Now, move your ass over here and help me see if there's some blanket or something around for the night."

<br>

"You boys still hanging around?" Elkins gives them a nod while serving some other town folks the next day. "Thought you'd have moved on by now."

"Believe me, we want to, but eh.. still waiting for the ride." Dean gives him one of those convincing smiles he has perfected over the years with case victims and authorities.

"There are a few spare horses around here if it's a ride you want," the bartender offers, being as kindly as any old Western man can be.

"Uh, we actually..." Sam starts.

"You know what, that would be awesome," Dean cuts him off, smiling brightly at the old man.

They use the gold they brought along to pay off the food and drink before heading out. Didn't get any suspicious looks.

"I'd give this one to Bobby," Dean murmurs under his breath as they walk out of the saloon. "Era of no plastic but all gold, I wouldn't know what to do if we didn't have those."

The bag of gold is still heavy on his shoulder. The weight of wealth and reassurance.

Sam scoffs. "No credit card fraud or pooling this time."

Dean looks back over his shoulder, eyes sprinkling with cunning joy. "Ha, but there's still poker. You never know what skill could come in handy or even save our ass some time a hundred fifty years in the past, do you, Sammy?"

Sam shakes his head, laughing.

<br>

The horses Elkins pointed them to belong to the late Judge and old Sheriff. One is a beautiful black horse with fur so bright and smooth it almost reminds Dean of the Impala.

"Hey baby," he strokes her back, voice gentle, love flowing from his eyes. "You miss me?"

"Dean, I don't think she'd ever known you," Sam snorts.

Dean gives him a stern look. "You don't know that." He shifts the attention back to the beauty, its muscles strong and warm under his palm. "We might have met in our previous lives or something. Tell me she's not exactly like Baby to you?"

Sam tilts his head, regarding the horse, the tip of his lips curling. "Hmm." he has to agree.

The other tan-brown horse with a white stripe on its nose decides to throw a temper tantrum at Sam for a few moments when he approaches, but eventually lets him tie the saddle and pats its back.

<br>

They don't really have anywhere in mind to go, with the horses. But they are still overdelighted to have them. Dean, especially.

Days later, when he's grooming the Baby -- of course he has to name her after the real Baby -- Sam tells him, chuckling, "You have any idea how much it's like watching you wash the car?"

Dean doesn't look back from his busy work by hand, "I don't know, Sam, just the me in another life, I guess."

Sam's chuckle fades. The silence makes Dean glance back warily.

"What?" he asks, slowing down the handwork.

"I didn't even realize how settled in we already are, like we're *actually* already in another life." Sam frowns. "Almost forgot to count how many days it's been, since..."

"Since March the fifth," Dean says for him. "Since the day the phoenix died and Cas was supposed to meet us. Yeah I remember. Kinda hard to forget, don't you think?"

The glass bottle of phoenix ash is still tucked under his jacket, just in case he has to be pulled away in a hurry, he'd make sure the reason why they're here in the first place wouldn't get lost.

Sam swallows, giving Dean a quick glance, a little sheepishly. "So is it time we finally start talking?"

"About what?"

"About what to do if Cas never comes, if he just can't, and we might have to figure out our own way back?"

Dean stares at him, face grim, brows knitted tight. Eventually he sighs, giving in to the stare, licking his lips. "Ok, yeah, you might be right. Can't put all the burden on the man, he might even need our help back home."

<br>

### Chap.1-2 (Cas wake up)(Bobby's, 2011, Bobby POV+Cas)

> **Outline:** Cas passes out for longer than in canon, when he comes to it's past 24h and he's super weak and wounded. He doesn't want to risk Bobby's soul and can't leave the boys behind, but also like he mentioned, now they are lost to him, so he'd have to fight hard in the time flux to find them.

Bobby paces the living room, a few steps in front of the sofa where a bleeding-out angel passed out.

"Balls." It might be the hundredth or thousandth time he's cursed. He doesn't bother counting.

The countdown on the clock is running out fast. Cas doesn't show any sign of waking up.

Bobby frowns deeply, throwing looks between the clock and the angel every other second.

Cas crashed into the kitchen a little more than three hours ago, leaving a bloody sigil on the fridge door, and practically went straight into a coma. No explanation.

"Balls." Bobby curses under his breath again, staring at the unconscious angel.

The timer soon hits zero. The boys would be waiting in the goddamn Wild West a hundred fifty years in the past, the only angel in the room is not waking up. Both waiting for him to save the day, what's he gonna do, wrapping a wing that's never there?

"Okay Cas, don't smite me or anything," Bobby approaches the sofa gingerly, thinking twice, then shaking Cas's shoulder. First not quite harshly, then a lot more. But still, the eyes are closed, the cut on his abdomen is bleeding some ominous bright light.

Bobby slaps his face -- also starts easy, all things considered, then a lot less so. But nothing works.

Bobby runs out of ideas.

"Balls" isn't cutting it anymore, given the circumstance. He needs a stronger word.

<br>

There might be a spell or something useful in the books. Bobby jumps back into the familiar realm, diving into the lore and magic, looking for something that may remotely give some hope, of either bringing the boys home himself or waking up the angel.

He had wrapped a bandage around Cas's abdomen, trying vainly to stop the angelic bleeding. Not gonna do anything to the celestial creature in his true form, sure, Bobby figured that, but maybe healing the vessel might just help him recover a little faster? With jack squat by hand, all he can do is hope.

And pray.

He has to pray for all of them now. But if not to Cas, to whom?

Glancing at the bloody sigil with Cas's fingerprint that is visibly gradually drying out, it can be a big mistake. Bobby downs a glass of whiskey before doing that.

"Well, call me stupid but none of you are here to stop me, so here goes nothing." Bobby looks up at the ceiling.

"Whatever angel's out there," he says gruffly, can't decide whether to keep his eyes open or shut, he settles on squinting, "uh, hope you're on our side. Could use a little help here."

The sigil on the fridge door brightens up, burning into a lit-up golden color, as bright as the light leaking from Cas, then dying out slowly. The pattern looks a little shallower than before, muffled, Bobby observes, not sure what it means.

No angel shows up. Not sure if it's good news or bad, either.

Bobby turns back to the books for help.

<br>

Bobby doesn't close his eyes the first night. The letters on the pages start swimming.

Castiel is still not responding to anything. Face pale, body cold.

Bobby examines his wound -- while murmuring "I don't have a goddamn PhD in angel medics, just so you know" -- the cut is deep, the leaking light blinding, but Bobby decides it's not as blinding as yesterday. Could be wishful thinking though, or his eyes are just getting used to angel grace.

He sighs long and deep. "Should have talked them out of this, told you it's a bad idea, but who'd listen?"

The next day passes in the books and regular checks on the angel and alcohol. So does the day after.

Bobby is getting increasingly desperate. "Never thought I'd lose the boys like this, in a time even before they're born."

He slams Castiel's collar, shaking him much more violently. "You gotta wake up, Cas," his voice practically pleading. "The boys are waiting for you! Dean's waiting for you!"

Cas lets out a pained groan.

Bobby loosens the grip, easing him back down. "Cas?"

Exhaling sharply, Castiel wakes up. Eyes opening slowly, staring straight into the space in front of him, blank, then onto Bobby's screwed-up face, confused.

He frowns deep, trying to pull himself up from the sofa but wobbling so much that he crashes back down the second he puts weight on his legs.

"There he is." Bobby breathes out, not exactly relieved but at least lighter than the past seventy-something hours. He lends a hand to help Cas balance. "What happened?"

Castiel tears open the bandage, palm covering the wound. Light and human blood mix together, seeping out from between his fingers. Grimacing, he tells Bobby with a furrowed frown, "I was, uh... I was attacked. Betrayed by one of our own."

"Should see the other guy, right?" Bobby tries putting a lighter tone there.

Castiel probably doesn't get the reference, he answers anyway. "Rachel -- I had to kill her. But I was wounded. Needed somewhere safe, so... thank you."

"You mean that finger painting? What's with the artwork?" Bobby eyes the sigil that he has stared at for so long these past few days that he'd already memorized the thing. It's barely visible now. Barely anything more than a smudged bloodstain.

Cas follows his gaze, his frown deepening. "Is there any other angels coming around this place while I was unconscious?" he glares at Bobby.

Bobby shrugs. "Not that I know of."

Cas looks into him, voice graver. "Did you... pray to them?"

Bobby tilts his head, having a bad feeling yet has to defend himself. "Well, you were out, boys need a ride home, what else was I supposed to do? So yeah, distress call."

Cas looks like he was about to snap, but decides at the last second to turn it into a sigh. His lips thin into a line. "You might've just put both of us in extreme danger -- me especially. Raphael might've already heard it and find where I am, could already be closing in. I could be dead any minute now if it's not still shielding me."

Defeated, Bobby takes half a step back, giving Cas some space as he gives another attempt to stand up. "Well, I'm sorry. I guess. Was really out of options there."

"How long was I unconscious?" Cas leaves the sofa, walking shakily toward the desk.

"Three days, give or take," Bobby answers, without having to check the time. "Now would really be a good time to bring the boys home. Should have enough fun in Frontierland by now."

"I can't." Cas drops his head, facing away from Bobby.

"Come again?"

"The fight... it drained me." Cas shifts his feet, uneasy. "And it's been too long. They're lost to me already."

Bobby scowls at his back, snapping. "Then found them! You can't just leave Sam and Dean in the past like that!"

"I know! You think I don't know that?" Castiel blurts out, sharp and pained. He turns, meeting Bobby's eyes, solemn. Determined. "So I'll still go and try my best, but I don't know what the chances are. If I don't make it back..." he breaks the gaze, "please know that I'm truly sorry and I mean it."

With that, and a disturbance of wind flow in the room, Castiel is gone.

"What does that --" Bobby takes two steps forward, right next to where the angel was, but it is so clear there is nothing left there anymore.

### Chap.2-1 (Dean leave Sunrise)(Sunrise, 1861, Dean)

> **Outline:** Dean prays to Cas but doesn't get answer, they figure Cas said they're lost to him, so the idea is to do something "noisy" (big enough to get some notice from the future but not too big to disturb the history) so that their existence might be like some beacon in the timeline, hopefully making it easier for Cas to locate.
>
> Dean goes ahead start doing the reckless noisy things, Sam stay behind at Samuel Colt's place continue researching (time travel spell: angel feather, sands of time, tears of a dragon)

"Get out of my house." Samuel Colt grumbles, without bothering to lift his head. His colt on the desk by his hand -- a normal one, not the special one he'd already given them.

"I'm really sorry to bother you again," Sam steps gingerly ahead, Dean follows him a few steps behind. "I wouldn't bother you if it's not absolutely urgent."

"Thought I already did my share of help." He eyes them. "Don't tell me the Colt didn't work on the creature you're hunting."

"No, it's not that," Dean chimes in. "It worked, but uh... it's something else we could use a little help here."

"What part of *I'm retired* failed you?"

*Jesus, Samuel is clearly not an easy one to work with.* Dean thinks quietly, eyebrows raised a few inches higher.

"Like I said, in our time, you're sort of a really big deal, the most famous hunter -- " Sam manages a tight smile, as friendly as he can muster.

"Heard you the first time."

"So we figured you'd be the best supernatural researcher around here too." Dean pulls a puffing grin with his best effort.

"Please, we are not asking you to hunt with us or anything," Sam continues. "Just need a little help with research."

<br>

It turns out their guess isn't too far off. Samuel has as big a book collection as Bobby or the Campbells, tucked right downstairs in the place where a cellar should be, but with tons more additional traps and sigils painted over every inch of the floor and walls.

Panic room *and* library, nice. *Classic.* Dean looks around, thinking how *fun* it must be to be able to spend all the time reading while hiding out here.

Sam nudges him, eyeing the rows of books. Dean nods back.

Research time.

<br>

"Don't you think if there were a way to pull it off here and now, someone would have done that already?" Dean puts a book down after god knows how many hours, wiping his face with his hands, giving his brain a break. "Then why didn't we ever run into people time-traveled from the past all the time?"

Sam doesn't move his eyes away from whatever he's scanning. "They don't know what we know," he deadpans.

*But they don't know much about this time thing, either.* Dean thinks. It's always just Cas swinging them around, or some other douchebag angels occasionally. Just popping in and out, not really much theory or science to learn about.

Should've probably asked a few more questions about how the time flux thing works. He realizes belatedly. But after all, not everyone is as nerdy as Sam.

"I just remember Cas said once that time travel isn't easy but not impossible," Dean thinks hard, poking into some corner of old memories, the time when he met Mom and Dad when they were younger than his was, the other time when they tried to stop the yellow-eyed demon but still failed miserably, even the time when he got flipped to the messed-up five years into the zombie land future that turned out never would come to pass. What did Cas tell him during those short talks?

"He said that time is fluid, it's not easy, but apparently the angels have no problem bending it once in a while."

Sam jerks his head up, eyes bright with understanding, "And he also told us this time before we left, that the further back he sent us, the harder it becomes to retrieve us, that's why he said we couldn't stay more than twenty four hours, or we'd be lost to him."

"Which means we are totally lost to him by now and no way home without the wings," Dean says bitterly.

"No, Dean!" Sam jumps to his feet. "That might be the idea! This book here also says something similar, quite many are saying the same thing actually, I just didn't realize they might be literal, thought it's more metaphorical."

He slides the book over with some illustration that looks like a river with sandbanks on its sides. "Imagine time is like a river or something, fluid, a rapid turbulence flow of some kind, and each of us is like a floating leaf. Cas can bend the waterway so it becomes non-chronological, the downstream touches the upstream, that's how we landed here. And folding some part off would be to fast-forward into the future. But if we stay here too long, we are like the leaves washed too far downstream by the flow, that's probably why he can't find us, because he doesn't know where we are in the time flux anymore."

Dean's brows knit into a knot. "So... if we make some noise, *splash!* Fish jump out of the water, we can make ourselves stand out in this timeline river somehow, so he can find us."

"Like temporal beacons. It might work -- assuming Cas is still out there looking for us." Sam's voice gets quieter at the last part.

"He's out there," Dean says reflexively. Sam doesn't look convinced.

Dean gives the river drawing another look, thinking it over again, a minor smile starts creeping onto his face. "Sounds like a plan to me. What kind of noise are we talking about?"

Sam looks a little caught by the question, shrugging uncertainly. "How would I know? Something big enough to get some notice in the future, I guess? I would definitely notice if your face showed up in some old western posters, guess you can finally make a name for yourself in this era, like you always wanted, huh?"

Sam throws a half-smile in his brother's direction, knowing him too well.

Dean's eyes glint. "Any catch I need to know before messing up the time?"

The tip of Sam's mouth twitches. "Just like you said but, eh... don't mess up the time too much? Butterfly effect, remember? We just came back from the Titanic world like, last week?"

Dean returns an unimpressed look. "Let me, umm, just try one more time before any big moves, just to be sure."

Glancing up, he prays hard and loud, "Castiel, Angel of the Lord, if you have your ears on, come pick us up here, alright? Or we're gonna do something that can *possibly* break history, you hear me?"

He waits. One second. Two seconds. Three seconds. No stir of air, no fluttering wings, no feathered angel. No Cas.

Dean breathes out. "Okay then, let's do this, make some noise! Fun time!"

"Umm," Sam has a look of reluctance, slowly sitting back down.

Dean narrows his eyes. "You're not coming with me."

Sam spreads his hands wide, empty palms facing up -- all they have is a big pile of nothing. Resigned, he says, "Look, Dean, I know how much faith you have in Cas, I really hope I do too, but we just don't know. We could break history and the timeline and everything, and Cas might never come, and we would still be stuck here. I'm gonna find another way, a spell or something, things we can do *by ourselves*, swim our way back if we can."

"And you'll just stay here the whole time, researching?" Dean throws a quick glance at the stairs leading out of the cellar. "Samuel here doesn't look like he welcomes guests, let alone long-term tenants."

"Not too different from Bobby?" Sam curls up his lips a little.

Dean considers, huffing a quiet laugh. "Yeah, right, we are professionals in handling half-retired grumpy old drunk hunters."

They exchange an agreeing look. So it is decided.

Dean stands up, moving around the table, leaning in to give his brother a half-hug.

"See you around then, Sammy." He pats his back slightly before pulling away. "I'll drop by to pick you up after I find Cas."

"And how do I find you, if I find the spell?" Sam asks.

Dean grins. "Read the newspaper."

<br>

"So, you finally decide to move on?" Elkins gives him a once-over. "Where's the other tall guy?"

Dean has a red bandana wrapped around his mouth. He's changed into a new shirt and pants -- new for him, old for the clothes -- dirt and stains making him look exactly like the rest of the folks in the place.

*The look of a pilgrim,* Dean realizes.

He doesn't answer. Just strides straight into the room, heading directly for the bartender they've grown familiar with over the past couple of days. Dean lets out a breath, tasting a tad of bitterness lingering on the tip of his tongue.

Drawing the pistol from the holster at his waist in a smooth swing, he fires three shots into the ceiling. Some girls scream behind him.

Elkins looks at him, reaching for something hidden beneath the bar stand. Supposedly a shotgun.

"I suggest not," Dean shifts his aim toward him. The bartender stops moving, hands slowly rising.

"What's this about?" The old man is still surprisingly chill, not even showing much curiosity.

*Just how many gangsters has he run into before?* Dean finds himself wondering.

"What every outlaw around here wants," he says, aiming for a deep, grave voice. "You got any hidden treasure around here? Gold would do just fine."

"At least leave me a name to pass your story along?" Elkins slowly reaches toward a side drawer in his gaze. The gold he offers includes some of the very pieces they paid for their meals over the past few days. Dean has to push down the unease.

"Eastwood. Clint Eastwood. Best gunner in the western world," Dean tells him, with a mocking smile.

"We'll see about that." Three gunshots are released in the next second. Not Dean's this time. He dives behind an overturned dining table. A bullet narrowly misses his cheek, the air squealing sharp and heated.

"Son of a bitch!" He shouts. Dirt from the ground flies into the air, the room turns hazy for a second. He can't see much.

Dean blinks hard, looking left and right, trying to figure out what now.

"What the hell?" he thinks out loud. Guess the first rodeo isn't always very successful even for bonafide western gangsters.

"Well, *Hell* sends regards." Elkins' steps thud right in front of the table. Dean risks a glimpse, catching sight of black eyes.

"Freaking demon!" He growls, at the same time ducking into a gap between the stools, exactly when the table he was hiding behind gets shot a bullet hole around the place where his heart would have been.

A second gunshot is fired from behind him. Dammit, *demons*, plural. A whackload of them, it seems.

He hears giggling from the same direction where the gunshot comes, the place where the saloon ladies usually gather. If they are all possessed, he counts four already.

Even with the Colt he hasn't really had the upper hand against that many demons all at once, and god knows how many more might be crawling in as they speak.

"Surprised to see us?" Elkins' voice cuts through, harsh and edgy, nothing like how he used to sound when he spoke with them before. "We kill everyone close to Samuel Colt, just so you know."

"Huh, usually the other way around," Dean amuses. "So this is what it's like hanging around with a big name."

"You some big name, boy?" the demon inside Elkins smirks.

"That's the goal," Dean answers absently, tightening his grip on the pistol, silently counting the bullets he has left. *A bit low on ammo already,* he thinks, shifting the grip slightly. *Gotta figure a way out fast*.

The exit door is two tables away, with the three lady demons in between, but the side window is only one table away, with buckets of alcohol within range. He calculates his route.

The demons circle closer. Their footsteps heavy, the rustling of their dresses relentless.

Dean risks another look from the edge of his hideout. All of them have guns in their hands. *Since when do demons kill humans with guns? Western cowboy demons?* He teases the thought, finding it not as unpleasant as he would have thought.

The demon possessing the bartender lets out a raspy laugh. "You will die, Clint Eastwood."

"Huh, it's actually nice hearing people say that, you know. Sorta the point, could be a line for the movies." Dean estimates the timing and distance, then swings a stool at the foot of the closest demon girl, diving sideways. Darla, the saloon girl cornered him the first day, yells angrily, her eyes flashing black, swooping for him.

"Sorry about that," Dean says, a bit apologetically. Then diving for the bucket stack and kicking them loose.

A bucket rolls into the center of the saloon, alcohol leaking from a crack, leaving a wet trail as it goes. The second one follows, making the trail a spreading pool, soaking the next one inside out.

Dean leaps out of the place through the window right before the demons shoot the spot he had been. Bullets and sparks catch the alcohol, the whole place turns into a roaring pile of flame and smoke in seconds. Demons hiss furiously inside.

The second floor crumbles down in the fire. Dean only then realizes he forgot to check if there were any humans up there, but it's too late already.

He unleashes the horse from the stable and gallops out of the town, heading west without looking back.

<br>

He doesn't slow down until the burning hut is completely out of view. The sun is setting ahead of him on the horizon. He eases the reins, letting the horse stroll.

Dean glances back at the wild plain territory behind him, barely anything to see. Barren and wild, cactus and weeds growing from the sand, no sign of civilization.

"No coming back to Sunrise, Wyoming now," he sighs, patting the duffel bag and roll of blanket strapped tightly to the horse's back, the same way he'd check the Impala's trunk to make sure he had everything he needs for the road.

Dean removes the Sheriff's pin from his shirt. "Didn't expect the first gig to end up like that, goddamn demons always ruin the day."

He strokes the horse's neck gently, speaking to her as much as to himself. "What do you think, that's a loud enough distress call for Cas or not?"

He looks up at the sky. Night is falling slowly, the color transitioning from dark blue to deep purple. Some stars that are incredibly bright and shining already start blinking above these lands. Light pollution isn't a thing yet. He wonders if they look the same a hundred fifty years into the future.

The pure universe hanging on top of him like a gigantic globe, celestial, but not in a biblical way.

Dean lets his fingers comb through the horse's hair, feeling the creature's muscles rise and fall as she jogs. "Yeah, I know," he says quietly, "Probably not."

Him not being home already is proof by itself.

"Looks like it's just you and me and the whole wild west now, Baby," he pats the horse. "Come on then, let's head west and make some more noise, he's gotta hear one of 'em. Good thing all the land between here and the ocean is free to go."

The whole wild west ahead of him, free to explore.

But Dean isn't anywhere near ecstatic. It's just too damn far from home.

### Chap.2-2 (Cas time travel)(Time flux, Cas+Raphael)

> **Outline:** Cas's in no condition to time travel but he worries about Dean too much so he risks flying into the time flux in his wounded state, leaving bloody trace behind. His trace exposes him, Raphael follows him into the time flux, so he has to escape the chase while tries to locate Dean, Cas crash lands in Sunrise Wyoming but Dean's not there.

"This is stupid, even for you." The thundering voice sounds from above him. Cas doesn't need to look up to know who has found him.

The stab pierces through the abdomen of the vessel, but it's even worse for his true form. The outer ring gets a deep cut through, almost reaching the middle ring. The root of one of the right wings is also wounded. He can barely fly straight.

*It's like leaving a blood trail in the open sea,* he thinks distantly. *He's the drowning swimmer, attracting the sharks.*

"Thought I could at least have a head start before you catch up," Cas answers, beating his wings as hard as he can. Pain tears through his wings with each slap. But he has to keep going.

Below them, the time flux is flowing, bright and sparkling. Almost like flying through space, admiring the galaxies. In a way, time is no different from space.

"So you know I'd find you, sooner or later," Raphael amuses. The flow from the archangel's wings disturbs this time dimension like a tornado sweeping through a wild plain. "I didn't know you were the suicidal type."

"Not suicidal." Cas dives lower, avoiding the central turbulence, trying to use the left wings to compensate for the wounds on the right side. He doesn't bother checking if the bleeding grace is getting worse. The bandage Bobby wrapped him with didn't do anything. His essence is running out fast.

He's running out of time too.

*Not suicidal. Desperate.*

It's actually funny. Cas's mind somehow wanders away. If Dean were here, he'd definitely make a remark about how you can even run out of time when you're literally *in* the time dimension, scouting the time flux.

Cas can't think of any joke himself.

*Not suicidal, just trying to find the people too important to lose.* He just needs enough time to find them before Raphael gets a hold of him -- and undoubtfully damns him into the eternality of being killed over and over again.

The time flux has an urgent turn around the nineteenth century, with the Civil War and everything, the history is not so easy to make out. Cas squints, focusing on the reflections in the time flux --

That's when he loses balance suddenly. A harsh tear on the tip of his top left wing makes him gasp in pain, the inner ring shrinks reflexively, like how a human would yell and jump back at an unexpected strike of pain.

Cas curls his left wings for protection, dropping altitude. Raphael's big shadow swoops right on top of him, like an eagle diving for its prey sparrow.

He manages a sharp turn to avoid the following attack. The tip of his lower wings dipping into the time flux, catching a dampness from the early twentieth century.

Cas resets his rings and wings, swirling backward.

"You do know it is pointless to fight or hide from me, don't you?" Raphael mocks, turning around as well, following him two wings' distance away.

"How did you find me?" Cas asks, hoping vainly that talking might distract the archangel for a split heartbeat for a break, while widening all the eyes he has to scan the time flux. It's been a while since he had to fight in the time dimension in his true form, even longer to have to find a soul here, if ever.

But surely familiarity and the profound bond should make it easier? Cas starts getting anxious, finding the time flux looking even more rapid and confusingly dazzling than he remembers. Something disturbing is going on in these western times, but he doesn't know what, and Dean is there, going through the weird time and history on his own, without wings and without protection.

Cas flaps his wings more rapidly, bearing all the tearing sensation ripping through his rings and wings. Not caring that the faster he goes, the faster the grace bleeds and loses, spilling from his true form like dripping blood along the way.

Then, for the second time, the disturbance in the air hits him sharply from the center, he almost falls directly into the time flux below.

The archangel hasn't even unleashed his supernova-level grace, just using the tips of his wings that are as sharp as any metal in the universe that can ever be, almost cutting him in half.

Castiel screams in pain in his true voice. The time dimension echoes his sound. Raphael laughs behind him in satisfaction.

"I can smell your bleeding grace from two galaxies away, Castiel," Raphael tells him, tone satisfying. "Let alone that human you hang out with, gave us a loud and clear coordinate. So give up, Castiel, you can not hide from me in any time or space. I will always find you, and I will always destroy you."

The second cutting swing comes from the other side, Cas hears it coming before it hits him, he ducks sideways. The archangel's feathers are like natural angel blades, scratching his innermost ring, missing the heart of his essence by mere inches.

He might get killed any minute now. Cas thinks bitterly. And then Dean and Sam would be trapped in the western wasteland of the past, forever. They won't even reach the time when the first Impala was ever produced when they die of old age -- *if* they die of old age. They won't ever come back home again.

Cas blinks hard, opening all his wings again, wounded or not, shooting upward. Directly into Raphael from below. The rings around his essence spin fast and urgent, like a rapidly beating heart.

Raphael doesn't expect the change of direction in his moves. He has no time to divert.

Castiel uses his whole existence as a bullet, the momentum as the fuel, hitting Raphael in his most vulnerable ring -- the same part in Cas that is beating and spinning glaringly, the innermost ring around the essence. Raphael is pushed off balance, for a split heartbeat, out of control of where he's heading.

Castiel catches the blink of opportunity when Raphael does not have eyes on him, diving straight into the time flux below.

The time dimension swirls and rotates around him, absorbing him into the point he hits. The speed of rotation makes his rings twist and deform. No wonder every time he pops Dean in and out, the human would complain about motion sickness. This must be the exact dizziness a human would feel if he doesn't have any grace left.

The thought makes his heart thump hard and cold.

*Did he lose all his grace just to reach them? How is he going to take them home now?*

Without any answer to any of the questions, his feet land on solid ground again. Castiel tumbles forward, dropping onto all fours, spitting blood onto the sandy ground in front of him. The view is swimming, the ground floating up and down as if he's being washed away by the tide. He has to focus very hard to not let his cold, shaking limbs give way here and now.

Wind blows, sand rises around him. The vessel coughs, more blood dripping, from everywhere, not just from his mouth.

Cas only gets time to see a wooden sign with neat carving that says "Sunrise, WYO." before the world turns completely black.

>
> (Dean pray to Cas every night, bad feeling)

#### Act 1 ("Unforgiven")

Life on the road on horseback and life on the road in a car have more similarities than Dean ever realized. Like the quietness at night, the road and space all dark, when it seems the whole world dissolves, leaving only him and the Baby floating in space.

Except, with the black horse, with its rising and falling rhythm of muscle, the feeling of being accompanied by some living, breathing thing is somehow so very soothing. Almost as if he's accompanied by someone he knows.

Dean presses his palms on the horse's back, just to feel its heartbeat. Then slowly feeling his own heartbeat calming down.

He looks up at the starry sky, closing his eyes, exhaling deeply, smelling the sand and bushes. *Where are you, man?* He can't help thinking, not even sure if that's a prayer or just a haunting thought replaying itself in his mind.

He lets the horse decide the road for him, leaving his own mind wandering -- that's another similar yet different experience from driving, one he can actually take his eyes off the road long enough and no need to worry about crashing into some other incoming vehicles.

When the night sinks deep into the dark and cold hour, he lets the horse rest. Finding a relatively soft spot on the sandy land, wrapping himself in the blanket, he rests his eyes for a handful of hours. Then moves on again before the sun fully rises.

Dean thinks about that illustration image of the time flux all the time. The shape of a river, and a floating leaf flowing down the stream. He feels exactly like that floating leaf now.

<br>

There are towns scattered here and there across the western lands like stars in the night sky. Without a map, Dean doesn't know exactly how to find one, but the horse knows the way better than he does. Sometimes he wonders how many places she has already been to.

She leads them into a small town, its name reading "Thunderhill, Colorado," according to the wooden plaque swinging outside the town.

The place looks like a replica of Sunrise, Wyoming, except the main road through town is wider. Men in fine, well-tailored suits come and go on horseback, ladies in delicate, laborious dresses. The view is actually somewhat pleasant to enjoy, but Dean is not here for sightseeing.

He goes into the saloon -- at least this has to be universal in all times and places, there must always be a saloon in each and every western town, for his comfort.

The girls are more enthusiastic and younger here than Elkins' place. Dean meets their eyes -- they are old-time good-looking, mostly. They grin at him with professional smiles and practiced cheer, Dean walks toward the owner of the place and asks for a room.

"You want to pick one you like?" the skinny man behind the counter asks meaningfully, nodding at the girls.

Dean glances back, finding their eyes intensely on his back. He gives a short chuckle, "Nah, just for sleeping."

"Your loss," the man makes a face, pointing him to the stairway.

He should probably start planning his grand criminal plan sometime soon. Dean thinks as he drags his steps up the stairs, feeling his bones and muscles complaining about sleeping on the wild ground for too many nights in a row. It's making his joints and neck stiff and wrecked like a beat-up car. He has to have at least one decent night before thinking about some big history-breaking-level moves.

Dean throws himself onto the bed that smells of something suspicious, but probably not too different from all those cheap motels he has been used to his whole life. Dean falls asleep like that without bothering to take his clothes off.

He is woken up several hours later by some loud crying and yelling from next door. A man is angrily shouting "Whore!" and cursing, while a girl is screaming helplessly. Something crashes to the floor, shattering into pieces.

Dean jumps to his feet, dashing out to the next room without thinking.

A man twice bigger than him is standing on the lone bed in the center of the room, all naked and hairy, holding a knife in his hand high above his head, almost touching the ceiling.

The crying girl curls in the corner of the bed like a startled little creature, wrapping herself up in her arms, covering her face with her fingers. Unclothed and crying loudly, screaming for her life. Blood streaming between her fingers.

Dean recognizes her from the group of saloon ladies who greeted him when he arrived.

He approaches the man carefully, eyeing the knife, closing the distance between them, tone demanding, "Why don't you put the knife down and let's talk?"

The man glances back at him for a split second, grumbling, "Go away. None of your business."

"It's my business because I was woken up," Dean takes another step closer, barely a dive's distance away from him now. He tries to hint to the girl to get away while the man's distracted, but she's just too busy crying. He can't tell where the blood is coming from and it worries him.

"Very well," the man snarls. "I'll deal with you once I kill the bitch."

"Can't let you do that." Dean charges the remaining two steps in a heartbeat, arms dragging around the man's waist, pulling him off balance and falling off the bed. The knife is still in his hand.

The man struggles violently and breaks loose from Dean's hold, fumbling to his feet, throwing himself at him.

Dean gets pinned to the ground under the weight, wrestling with every fighting skill he's picked up over the years, but battle techniques for everyday monsters are not as useful against a pissed-off cowboy when he's not trying to kill him.

The man fights like a gorilla, ending up straddling him with one hand pressing on Dean's chest, stopping him from getting away, the other hand pressing the tip of the knife against his cheek. "You should keep your nose clean," he grits the yellow teeth.

The knife feels cold against his skin. Dean wonders how much he can move his head before it stabs through his skull.

"Cleaner than yours," Dean barks back, staring the man in the eyes deadly focused as if they're in a gun duel. He moves suddenly, so quick that the other doesn't have time to react, and Dean already breaks his hands free. He twists his wrist in a way sharply that the man has to loosen the hold of the knife, and the next second, the knife lands in Dean's hand.

Just in the blink of an eye, their positions shift. Dean holds the knife an inch from the man's neck, close enough to make his point clear. The man stills.

Dean demands, "Now you wanna explain what's the matter with the lady?"

Right at this moment, three men burst into the room, all in uniforms, with a sheriff's pin gleaming on the chest of the leading aged man.

"Put down your knife, for Christ's sake!" Three shotguns point straight at him. The Sheriff steps closer, solemnly, eyes moving between Dean and the man in his grasp.

Dean knows better than to bring a knife to a gunfight with three cowboy lawmen.

He lets his hand fall and gets tied behind his back with a rough rope by a deputy. The other guy is tied to the same wooden stake hammered into the ground.

The Sheriff glares between them. "Now, talk!"

Dean purses his mouth, glancing at the girl in dismay at his rescue.

An older lady is tending to her wounds. She removes her hand very slowly and reluctantly from her face. Tears are still falling unstoppably. A long, bloody cut diagonalizes across her young, pretty face, narrowly missing her eyes, but slicing all the way from her forehead down across her cheek, reaching the edge of her jaw. One that will undoubtedly leave a permanent scar on that face for life.

The man tied behind him grumbles, "That crazy man came out of nowhere and wanted to kill me, you saw how he moved with a knife. I had to defend myself."

Dean rolls his eyes. Should have known, son of bitches around here always mouthful of lies. "Only because he was two seconds away from killing that lady."

"Bitch had it coming," he growls. Dean can feel his shrug against their tied-together backs.

"What did she do?" the Sheriff asks.

The naked cowboy doesn't answer.

"Mike, what did she do?"

"She chuckled when she saw his tiny junk, that's what." The older lady turns from cleaning the wounds on the girl's face, speaking on her behalf, snapping harshly. "Now look what he's done! She's ruined!"

She's not wrong, his junk dangled pitifully as he moved around earlier. Dean has to stifle a chuckle of his own, but the crowd around them isn't as generous. The cowboy Mike growls something under his breath, the sound throttled in his throat like a caged tiger huffing.

The skinny man behind the counter chimes in. "There has to be justice, Little Bill. Who would want a whore with a scarred face? I bought her last spring, and she's damaged goods now. She could've served for another five, ten years."

*Wow.* Dean thinks. *Talk about authenticity. The rural, cruel world for the ladies is just part of this era. Those classic movies aren't kidding.*

Sheriff Little Bill glances between the saloon owner and the naked cowboy, then checks on Dean again. "And you're just being a good man, playing hero?"

Dean shrugs. "What can I say? Just another day of my life."

The Sheriff snorts, turning to the cowboy. "How many horses do you have, Mike?"

"Five," he answers.

"Alright, here's the deal. By spring, you take two of the finest horses and bring them here to Skinny. And we call it even. What do you say?" The Sheriff declares.

"What, nothing for the girl there?" Dean blurts out, feeling ridiculous. "She's disfigured! He just ruined her whole life!"

"Why don't you wed her if you're so concerned?" Little Bill retorts.

*What an asshole.* Dean stares at the man's face, forgetting momentarily he's in their land and time, and wants nothing more than to give him, the shitty cowboy, and the skinny saloon owner, one punch to the nose for each of them. *Call it justice.*

"You are not even gonna whip him?" The older lady heckles in disbelief.

"Isn't there enough bloodshed?" The Sheriff does not look back at the ladies, simply nodding at the crowd. The verdict is concluded. "Gentlemen, good night." He heads out.

The two deputies untie their hands and follow him out.

Dean flexes his numb wrist, glancing at the cowboy Mike, wondering how stupid a move it would be if he gives him a punch again. The Sheriff is barely out of the saloon.

"Off you go, nothing to see now." Skinny shoos the crowd. "Have a good night. And you, Mr. Eastwood --" That's the name Dean registered with earlier. "-- Enough of playing hero, my girls don't need a prince on a white horse, they have me. Better if you get going, you understand?"

Dean throws a glance at the girls again. The poor wounded one has stopped crying now, the other girls help wrap a gauze on her face like a pirate's blindfold. Blood reddens the cloth. She looks at him, desperate, helpless. Eyes pleading. Hatred shines when she glances at the man who owns her and the man who disfigured her. But it is so clear that there is nothing she can do.

Dean takes his gaze back, walking slowly toward the counter. "Oh, I understand," he says slowly, stopping at arm's length from Skinny. "But you see, I didn't come riding in on a white horse, I came in black."

He punches the man in the face. His knuckle ache with scratches and blood from the force, but it feels damn good. It feels right.

He reaches for his collar, aiming for a second blow. The man rises with a pistol in his hand. There is another click of a gun safety switch behind his back. Dean doesn't need to look back to know who it belongs to. The girls gasp.

He releases the saloon owner, his hands relaxing slowly, but edging toward the holster.

"Should have killed you when I had the chance," the cowboy says.

*Two on one. An odd chance, but not impossible,* Dean calculates. Clint Eastwood could definitely take down more than that number and make a good story. And good thing, he does have two pistols.

"Yes, you should," Dean answers slowly. "Because now you're gonna pay."

He can see the man's hand shaking. The pupils dilate. The index finger twitches on the trigger. The dark muzzle of the pistol points at his heart menacingly.

Dean holds his breath. His own fingers are inches away from his pistols. The tension vibrates in the air.

Then all of a sudden, at the very same second, four gunshots ring out.

Dean ducks to the ground, two pistols in hand, both smoking hot from the shots. A bullet broke a glass on the bar stand. Mike lies on the ground, a bullet hole in his stomach, bleeding red, gasping painfully for breath. Skinny falls behind the counter, groaning loudly, a hole in his shoulder.

Dean stands up, without a scratch, scrutinizing the naked bleeding cowboy. "Think twice next time before being an asshole." He spits at him, knowing the other man behind the counter can hear him.

The wounded girl murmurs a heartfelt "Thank you" to him as he passes her on his way to gather his belongings upstairs. Dean returns a short nod.

This is just gonna be another town he can never come back to.

<br>

#### Act 2 ("Butch Sundance")

Dean doesn't expect to be recognized when he reaches Utah. Words travel faster than his horse, apparently.

But still not fast enough to cross time and history and reach Cas, it seems. He just has to keep doing what he already started, with or without a plan -- the path of a western outlaw.

The gang is playing poker at the saloon when he pushes the door open. One of them looks up first, and the rest stop the game.

"Clint Eastwood," they say, not in the friendliest tone.

Dean tenses, fingers reaching for his pistols automatically.

They laugh loudly and drunkenly, standing up and moving toward him, no guns pointed his way. Dean lowers his hands, squinting, confused.

"Look at this good lad." The one that seems to be their leader stands two steps away in front of him, glancing back at the rest of the group. They make cheerful noises.

Dean stares at him.

"Heard you've got quite some body counts on your trail, Clint, but only those who deserved it. Figured you'd try your luck around here about now." The cowboy holds out a hand. "Butch. We are the Hole-in-the-Wall gang, if you have been around long enough, you'd have heard of us."

Dean huffs a laughter, shaking his hand. "Oh, I've heard," he says admiringly, more enthusiastic than he intends. How could he not? The legendary Hole-in-the-Wall gang, not only has he rewatched the movie more times than he can count, but also knows the inside-out of their whereabouts and everyone's ending. Perks of time travel. But that would be years down the road, he wouldn't worry for them yet. Still early enough in time.

"I take it that must be the Sundance Kid?" Dean nods at a sharp-looking man by the desk, who didn't bother to stand when the others did, a moustache too thick to see the lips.

Butch follows his gaze, nodding, beaming with approval. "So you did hear about us." His tone over glad and polite. It's actually surprising to see one so affable and polite as a gangster, no wonder the gang makes their charming reputation in history. If he sticks with them, maybe his name can be branded together and make out loud like a quick pass? Dean wouldn't complain hanging out with this group if they're truly like the movie shows.

"Come join us, the round's on us." Butch gestures, and Dean sits next to him. The group resumes their poker game.

"Thought you mostly hung around Wyoming?" He can't help wondering out loud. "What brings you to Utah?"

Butch laughs while pouring him a drink. "What can I say, we ran out of banks there."

"Already?" Dean amuses. There gotta be another thirty years before their lights out, will there be any banks left in the states for them to rob? He wonders, but knows that would be a question that spoils the future and more importantly, what he knows and where he comes from, Dean is clever enough to remember to keep his mouth shut.

Butch doesn't notice his pause, just shrugs. "There will be more once we finish with Utah and Arizona and all those barbaric places. We'll come back to Wyoming. They keep building new banks like growing crops to harvest. What a nice way of provoking new fortune, wouldn't you say?"

Dean laughs and nods, drinking from the glass. It's not beer, and it tastes better than Elkins' stock.

"You got a job in this town?" Three drinks later, Dean asks. With poker cards in his hands. Sundance is dealing.

"Right down the road, the new bank has only two guards and closes at sunset," Butch tells him. Dean wonders curiously how come no one in the place hears their loud discussion of a robbery and raises an alarm. But glancing around, judging by how drunk most folks are and the fact that it's still bright afternoon, the answer isn't too difficult to figure out.

"You want to join?" Butch plays his cards, glancing at him. "We could use a man like you."

Dean looks at his cards, pretending he's thinking about what to play next. "Sure," he says, picking two cards and throwing on top of the ones Butch just played.

"Sundance can cover you if things go bad," Butch says in a light tone, no sign of worry or concern.

"I'm relieved," Dean answers with a smile.

They leave the saloon about half an hour before sunset. Not all of them can walk straight, but they don't need everyone for the action anyway.

The robbery goes smoothly.

"The money isn't yours, life is. The company will cover the loss, don't try to be a hero," Butch tells the people in the bank, with a gun in his hand. Dean and Sundance by his side.

The guards don't even try to keep up a fight. Dean locks them inside the safety chamber, takes the case with gold and cash, and passes it to Butch.

They leave the town galloping before the Sheriff is informed or the deputies get a chance to chase. The town is out of sight shortly, the gang cheers with their profits.

"Well, that was easy," Dean smirks.

"That your first robbery?" Butch glances at him.

"You could say that," Dean decides the one with the demons doesn't count.

"You are a natural," Butch compliments.

They keep moving south.

<br>

Dean notices a poster of his own face outside a bank in a town in Arizona during scouting. Next to the ones of Cassidy and Sundance. Headlining the price of a wanted reward. The name under his sketch is "Clint Eastwood," at least that makes him smile a little.

He goes back to Butch and says it might not be a good idea to rob here again, the guards can probably recognize them easily enough.

"You're afraid?" Butch raises an eyebrow. "Afraid of death?"

"No," Dean defends automatically, but his thought does wander briefly, imagining his own dead body lying on the bank floor, bleeding out with a bullet hole to the heart, imagining Cas finding him like that, or Sam. Or maybe none of them does and they never find out what happened to him. He swallows down the lump in his throat hard. "But isn't it better to stay alive?"

Butch considers, then agrees to skip this town.

The next town is the same, the wanted price gets even higher. The bank has more guards than they saw before anywhere else, and there are patrols on the road, carrying rifles.

"That's getting ridiculous," Dean complains. "Where do they find so many people to protect some printed paper, but no one really does a girl a solid justice?"

"Welcome to the Wild West," Butch replies.

"Are we switching gears now?" Dean asks, trying to remember the timeline of events for them in history. He still keeps Sam's warning in mind about not messing with the real important history stuff, and wonders what's the odds Cas might see a wanted poster of him and know where and when he is.

"What do you mean?" Butch doesn't follow.

Dean finds himself in a big moment of realization that this very idea of robbing trains might actually come from him. The bootstrap paradox.

He asks them, "Where does the money in banks come from?"

"The carriages?" one of the members offers.

"And where do the carriages get them from?"

"The train." Butch starts smiling.

"There's a railway line right across Arizona." Dean doesn't need an updated -- outdated, in this sense -- map to know what the atlas looks like. "We just need some dynamite."

They gather the dynamite, so much more than they actually need, and blow the safety case to the sky. The poor clerk from the Union Pacific Flyer murmurs his protest through the whole thing, landing bloody and with a broken arm after the smoke from the blast clears. But at least he's still alive.

Printed cash flies in the sky like falling snowflakes. The gang cheers and grabs the money, stuffing as much as they can grab into their jacket pockets and bags. Dean catches a few bills that fall close to him and examines the patterns and numbers on the paper. Butch watches him from the corner of his eye.

By nightfall, they are out of Arizona. The small saloon in Nevada doesn't know their names or faces. They order drinks and rooms, and accompanies of the fine ladies, many of them tipping over generously with the newfound fortune they just gained, leaving for the second floor way earlier than the usual turn-in hour.

Dean stays by the bar, sitting in a corner seat, soaking in the drink. Some town folks are playing banjos and harps in the empty space around the tables, the music loud and cheerful, just as western as it can be. Some girls sway to the music, then start dancing, some men joining them soon after.

Dean watches the group as if he's just watching an old western movie up close, but he's not really expecting to be inside the scene. He remembers there was one time he was absent-mindedly watching a rerun of *The Outlaw Josey Wales* in the motel when Cas dropped by.

"The classicest of the classic, the western to rule them all," Dean told him.

Cas sat down next to him on the motel bed, watching the screen that was way too small. They should watch it here, like this, surrounded by music and dancing people three hundred and sixty degree immersive, that's how they could get the whole vibe.

But Cas was already attracted. And Dean was pleased he could interest Cas with a western classic, only to realize minutes later that it was the music instead of the plot that had caught Cas's attention.

"It was beautiful," Cas said, in deep contemplation.

Dean glanced at him, seeing the constant frown unfold between the angel's eyebrows. His expression calm and peaceful, watching the television with a look that said his thoughts were already wandering elsewhere. Dean wondered if that was how the real Wild West was, and if Cas had been there. And he decided, he must have, being an angel and watching Earth for longer than any human history.

"What was it like?" He remembered asking him, can't help himself. "The real Wild West? The towns and people's lives two hundred years ago?"

Cas tilted his head ever so slightly, recalling. "Noisy," he told him. "Very vibrant and alive. I remember the music, it was beautiful. And the people were so simple, life was simple back then. But also bloody. A lot of blood and death, like human history always is."

Dean just nodded, his attention back on the television, with a quick glimpse at Cas every now and then. His lips curled up a little bit at that quiet, comfortable moment stretching between them. That was one of the few moments he got to relax when they were not busy handling apocalypses.

He wishes Cas were here with him, watching the dance, listening to the music. He's pretty sure Cas would enjoy it a lot and comment on something like the history of the harp or the name of their dance.

"You are not like any man I've ever know," the voice sounds up right next to him and gives Dean quite a start, he almost pulls his gun reflexively, only to find Butch sitting down on the stool next to him, with a glass of dark-colored liquid in his hand.

Dean relaxes his muscles, leaning back against the seat. "I'm not like any other men," he replies.

"You're not after fortune, but you rob," Butch observes, then adds. "Or woman, but you're certainly thinking of someone. Is there someone waiting for you to get back to, Clint?" His eyes glance briefly at Dean's fingers as if looking for a wedding ring.

"You could say that." Dean takes a casual drag from his glass.

"Then why don't you go back to her?" Butch asks, not in a manner of probing, but genuinely curious like a friend would.

Dean decides there is no point in correcting the pronoun, just to avoid complicating things. "I'm on my way," he says, as much of a fact as he can offer. "We got separated, so now I need to figure out my way home."

"You have a home to go back to." Butch looks surprised. "Most people around here don't, that's why we move all the time."

Dean hums, taking another sip, not really tasting the flavor of the liquid, wondering what home would be like now. Bobby might be anxious to death, pacing around his study, trying all kinds of different spells and rituals; Sam should still be at Samuel's place, not knowing if he'd find a solution or make any progress by now; and Cas... Cas is still MIA and no one's ever seen or heard from him ever since they parted that day. How long has that been? How long would they meet again, if ever? What if Sam was right and Cas is already gone and... Dean takes a large gulp to swallow down the growing panic in his stomach, feeling his throat still too dry.

"You alright?" Butch reads his face.

Dean hates it when people around him seem always able to read his thoughts on his face. "Yeah," he finishes the drink, leaving the glass on the bar and standing up. "Could use some sleep now. See you in the morning, Butch. Have a good night."

Butch nods and wishes him a good night.

Dean lies in the saloon bed for hours, listening to the folk music continuing deep into the night before finally falling quiet. His eyes on the ceiling, wondering if Cas can hear him still. He prays anyway.

<br>

They keep an eye on the newspapers and posters while moving around. It's always good to know what the lawmen know about them. And for Dean, he certainly can use a good reminder of how big a noise in the era that he has made.

The newspapers aren't always accurate -- as they have forever been. But at least the big headlines usually get their names right, some include their sketches similar to the wanted posters, others tell alleged, over-detailed stories of their robberies:

"Bank robbed in Rattlesnake Bend, Nevada" -- with a photo of the empty case where the gold is supposed to be.

"Cowboy killed in Cattle Creek, Kansas: Clint Eastwood's new headcount" -- with paragraph after paragraph from some witnesses saying how legendary he is, but not in a cold-blooded way, only elegant and attractive, and that dead cowboy was a bully in town.

Dean is amused by that one. "We were never even in Kansas!"

And Butch answers with: "That's just how the story travels."

"Silver Gulch, California: Robinhood appears" -- the small secondary title reads: "Mine robbed, Gold for the whole town." A pissed-off mine owner's curses take up most of the report.

"Well, that one we might actually try later," Dean says.

Butch hums. Dean's not sure if it means agreement or the opposite.

They have a debate over whether to go to California or New Mexico next when they reach the far south of Arizona.

They end up turning east.

"Would be good to see those mines," Dean mumbles.

"That's just rumors and daydreams," Butch replies.

<br>

The wanted posters with their faces have already reached New Mexico ahead of them. Dean has grown a beard ever since he saw the first poster in Utah, but the features are probably still recognizable.

They lay low and only sit in the corner seats of the inn.

Dean makes sure his cowboy hat is low enough as he drinks his beer and glances around, staying in the shade. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid sit at the next table, the rest of the gang scattered around the town.

The folks sitting at the table next to his chat loudly. He hears the name "Clint Eastwood" come up in their talks, so he can't help listening in with all the attention.

"You heard about the new rising star of a cowboy?" one of the folks says. "Name's Clint Eastwood."

"How big of a name is he?" Another asks. "Louder than Jeremiah Johnson?"

Laughter fills that table. "Bear fighting isn't news anymore, Eastwood is. Rumor says he runs with Hall-in-the-Wall gangs, shooting quicker than the Sundance kid. But he doesn't shoot unless the guy has it coming. He plays poker, robs banks, puts on a good old gun duel and never loses. Best of all, not like other gangs, he doesn't take the gold and cash for himself, he gives it to people in need. Poor people, folks like you and me."

"A savior and a saint," someone mocks with a laugh. "Exactly what we need nowadays."

"Robin Hood, more like," they say.

"But it doesn't matter how much folks love him, the companies and states sure as hell hate him. I heard Union Pacific Flyer already gathered a posse after the gang. Eastwood, Cassidy, and Sundance are all on their kill-at-sight list. They must've decided can't afford to have more trains robbed like that."

Dean finishes the rest of his drink in one pull and leaves the place quickly.

The rumor is certainly not just idle chatter. Under the night sky, hundreds of miles away on the barren, open land to their west, there are a dozen lights as small as fireflies in a summer night, moving up and down, in sync with the pace of horses running. The night covers the figures, but the hunter's instinct already kicks in, he moves toward his horse.

Butch and Sundance are right behind him when he leaves the place.

"Whatever they're selling, I ain't buying," Butch says, seeing the same obscured figures on their tail on the horizon.

They dash out of the town, then out of the state, heading north.

### Chap.4 (Cas's western life)(Sunrise, 1841, Cas)

> **Outline:** Cas is too wounded to fly again and can't risk using his power in case he gets noticed by Raphael (still scouting in time flux), so he lives in the town like a human, also tries his best to blend in. After a while when he recovers slightly, he asks around if anyone has seen the brothers based on his description but no one does. The town looks relatively new, not so crappy, he asks time and realizes why. He asks if there is any ranch job available instead. (leave suspension)

Cas wakes up with a moan, feeling his fingers and toes too far away, his head as heavy as that time he found a liquor store and drank the whole place dry.

He opens his eyes, seeing the white ceiling of the room he's in. A soft blanket covers his body. He tries to move his hand to lower it, only to find thick bandages wrapped over his whole back and front, restricting his movement.

He frowns at the bandages that have hints of blood showing from underneath, trying to remember why his whole body hurts like he has been chopped on a cutting board and why he can't heal himself properly.

A middle-aged madam enters the room. "Wouldn't move if I were you," she says, putting down a plate of food that smells good and greasy.

"Where am I?" Cas frowns.

"Slick Jim's Saloon," the woman answers, her back facing him as she fumbles with something. "Deputy found you unconscious just outside town and brought you in. Thought you'd be dead with all those wounds and blood, but look at you, still breathing. What happened?"

"I was... in a fight." The memory of the time dimension surfaces. The wingspan of Raphael that covered half the space, casting glooming shadows over him, still gives his thoughts a shudder of uneasiness. It must have been when he fell into the time flux and got carried here.

"You got an enemy on your tail?" the woman brings a wet towel over to his bedside. Cas gives her an tight appreciated grin.

"He won't follow me here," Cas tells her. Which is true, more or less, until he uses his grace and Raphael finds the traces and catches up again, eventually. Cas wonders how much time he can have before that happens, and more importantly, if he can find Dean and Sam first. The thought of them floating lost in history makes him grimace, distracted from the physical wounds for a brief moment.

The woman must have mistaken his grimace for pain, leaning over to lower the blanket and check the bandages. "You got a name?"

Cas thinks for a second. "Clarence," he tells her. "Clarence Novak."

"I'm Alice," she says, starting to unwrap the bandages to reveal the wounds on his body. "Helping in the saloon, sometimes patching people up when they need it. Sometimes people, other times just bodies."

Cas watches her hands, old and weathered. "You must have seen many people that needed patching up."

"More than I can count," she says plainly.

The layers of bandages come off, the pieces closest to his skin are soaked in blood. Now he can examine himself. There is a long horizontal cut across his chest, deep and nasty, right over where the heart is. A deep stab wound in the shape of an angel blade on his lower right abdomen, the one from Rachel, which feels like a long time ago and is still bleeding fresh. Alice guides him to turn onto his side, using a wet cloth to clean the wound on his back. And from where the cloth touches, one long vertical cut stretches down his spine, from little below the hairline to just above the tailbone. There are several other smaller cuts across his shoulder blades.

"That enemy of yours pretty much cut you in half," Alice comments.

"I believe that was his intent, yes," Cas agrees in a murmur.

She helps clean up all the wounds and the fresh new blood seeping through the stitches, then rises to fetch more bandages.

"I don't think I'd need those," Cas turns down the offer when he sees what she's about to do.

"And let yourself bleed to death? I don't think so." Alice's hands are strong against his own feeble fingers. The lack of strength in this body that he thought he was getting familiar with after inhabiting it for almost four years now surprises him. Cas falls silent and lets her do the job.

He closes his eyes, reaching inside, trying to scratch and find how much grace he still has left. The effort is exhausting and the result frustrating. The only things he can find inside are twisted guts and bones bleeding as much as the visible cuts on the skin. That explains the taste of metal in his throat.

He has to gesture for a pot and spits out the liquid flooding up from inside. The spit turns out bloody, leaving a bad taste on his tongue.

Alice offers water for a rinse, and looks at him like looking at a dying deer shot by a hunter's shotgun. "I'll be back with something to eat, if you feel like it."

The first reaction crossing his mind is to say thank you but he has no need for food, the second one realizes his empty stomach does make his body uncomfortable. Cas gives her a small smile and says, "Thank you, that would be nice."

And he is left alone in the room again.

The window of the place has a slit of opening, the smell of alcohol and frying stew passes through from the saloon downstairs. There are sounds of horses clopping past outside, the smell of fresh leather and cheap perfume reaching up. There must be some new houses freshly constructed, as Cas can still smell the lingering scent of sawdust from raw pine and oak.

Cas closes his eyes, breathing deep and exhaling long, feeling his lungs expand and contract in the most human way. It worries him, reminding him too much of a memory from back when Lucifer was walking the earth and Dean was practically the only one standing in his way of starting the Apocalypse, when it was two minutes to midnight but he couldn't help him anything more than distracting Michael to buy him five minutes that he needed. He chews on the feeling of being weak, being powerless, unable to protect the human in his charge, and he tastes nothing but bitterness.

Cas thinks about Stull Cemetery a lot, then Battle Creek, Michigan, the house with the woman and the boy where Dean was humming a tune while mowing the lawn. He should never have left that life, then he would never be lost and trapped in the Wild West in the past. Cas breathes out heavily, thinking, with too much clarity: *This is all his fault.* And he has to fix it, right all the wrongs, whatever the cost.

Alice comes back with food on a plate. Cas thanks her for it.

<br>

Strength comes back to him as time passes. Cas manages to get out of bed after about ten days, which is also about the time when Jim Elkins, owner of the saloon and bartender, starts asking when he's ready to pay for the room.

The cuts are still deep, the muscles around the wounds contract uncomfortably at each shift of movement, the pain from the injuries is numbed but not gone. Cas puts on an old shirt and pants that Alice found for him and steps downstairs.

The bartender is busy chatting with some folks by the bar. They laugh at some joke or recent news.

Cas decides to wait by the base of the staircase until they move away toward a clean, vacant table in the center of the room.

"There he is, the mysterious man who survived," Elkins regards him. "You look good."

"I look awful," Cas replies unhappily and honestly.

"That's true, I suppose." Elkins' mouth twitches in a small laugh, hands reaching for a used glass to rinse and wipe with a white washcloth. "Meant to visit upstairs but Alice said you were mostly resting. Figured not to disturb a patient."

"By *patient*, you mean *a dying man*," Cas points out, not minding the notion. "I appreciate the help and the place. I needed time to rest and heal, but now I must move on."

"Where are you heading?" Elkins looks at him, eyes sharp like an eagle, short stubble covering his jaw in a clever shape. A young man like him might have a good enough memory to recall if Dean and Sam have been here.

"Have you happened to remember two young men visiting here? One good-looking, about my height, the other tall like a giant, long hair?" Cas gestures with his hands around his head, trying to show how their hair looks by wiggling fingers in the places.

"Not that I can remember." Elkins shrugs, putting the cleaned glass onto the shelf. "Sounds like someone who'd leave an impression if they did."

Cas's eyes follow his movements, thinking. *Maybe they just didn't visit the saloon, which is normal. He'll just have to find them elsewhere.*

Cas is just about to leave for his room, when two people enter the place and the bartender greets them, "Morning, Sheriff. Deputy."

The Sheriff eases onto a stool, putting down the newspaper in his hand. "Can't believe old John actually made it and settled in Texas," he says to the other men, casual chatting, "Never thought he'd name the place *Dallas*."

Cas turns around sharply, moving so fast he can feel some stitches bursting open underneath the bandage. "What did you say?"

The Sheriff looks at him. "What? Dallas?"

Cas doesn't answer, he stills deadly when his eyes land on the paper.

He asks, then, after a long moment, if there is any ranch nearby he can help out at.

<br>

###### draft notes

Cas is too wounded to fly again and can't risk using his power in case he gets noticed by Raphael (still scouting in time flux). He lives in the town like a human, also tries his best to blend in. 

(facts but only reveal later in catch-up/flashbacks: To stay in the town for longer and not raise suspicion, Cas starts working in a ranch just to continue pretending to be a normal human. Cas is still weak and low in power, but as time goes by, he's growing back.)

### Chap.5 (Dean meet Cas)(Sunrise, 1861, Dean POV+Cas)

> **Outline:** Dean get chased around by the posse, not realize he's chased back to Sunrise, Wyoming where it all starts; get cornered into the sheriff's office, no escape, too much guns ("are they human or demons?"), Dean desperately pray to Castiel, get jump attacked by a stranger appearing from nowhere, very obviously trying to kill them and very good at fighting, and after a few rounds they realize he's not human. It's Castiel, the original 1860s timeline version, receives order that they're disturbing the timeline and comes to eliminate them (Castiel: "You pray too loud. I really don't know why you act like we are familiar" Dean: "I almost forget how big of an asshole you were before").
>
> Dean almost gets killed (heavily wounded), prays desperately instinctively again to his Cas, and gets saved when this Castiel gets blown away by power (fight a few rounds, Cas absorb 1861!Cas's grace, lighten up to show wings, wipe his memory, blast him away -> cruelest to himself, Dean: "Wouldn't that hurt... you? The old yourself?" Cas: "He has plenty time to recover, I don't." it's his own grace anyway). His Cas is there, dirty cowboy looking (reveal as part of posse), totally blend in and human-like, faceful of "I finally found you".
>
> Dean: "Where have you been?" Cas: "When." Dean: "Wh-- how long have you been here?" Cas: "Twenty years. I landed too early, so I have to wait for you to catch up, wait for time to pass in the slow old way." Dean: "I prayed to you." Cas: "I know." He can hear all the time but can't get to Dean. Dean: "What happened?"

The posse is relentless. They travel across bushes and water that should have covered their traces. And when Dean and the gang hide out behind rocky mountains, their horses are still moving their way, not diverted in the slightest, like hunting dogs catching the scent of prey and never letting go.

"Where are they coming from?" Dean wonders aloud. "How can they even follow us like this, we just passed the whole prairie. I don't even know where we are now."

"Must be Indians." Butch looks at them through a monocular, then passes the telescope to Dean. "Some tribes are amazing trackers. They'll never lose the scent once they pick it up until they're dead."

"Awesome," Dean murmurs, emotionlessly.

Sometimes by day, they manage to put another hundred miles between them and think it should be safe now. Then by night, once they stop for a few hours of sleep, the shaking lantern lights show up again on the horizon.

"Don't they ever need sleep or let the horses eat and drink or something?" Dean complains as he mounts the horse, yearning in tiredness.

The western life is no fun now -- not like the first few months were entertaining when he was robbing banks and trains, but at least better than having to keep running for his life. He even has nightmares of those shaking lanterns in the distance. Never close enough to get a clear view of the faces, but always there on their tails. It's like some old saying goes, they're like the faceless shadow of death, always there following you closely so you have to keep moving. And one day, when you move too slowly, or sleep for too long, they'll catch up.

"We should probably split up," Dean pants, when they are on the rocky mountains in Colorado. Stones and rocks roll unstably at the horses' feet, falling into the cliff and the creek down below. "Easier to take down three or four than having the whole dozen of them chasing us all like Nazguls."

"I don't know who that is, but sounds like a plan to me," Butch says, frowning at the way they came from. The posse isn't in view yet, but they all know they're not far behind.

Dean shakes hands with them both.

Butch pats his back. "Take care, brother."

Dean gives him a cowboy salute.

Same with the Sundance Kid.

Dean keeps going north. He doesn't keep track of where Butch and Sundance are headed. They might head east now, likely. Kansas is worth a visit and they can probably do those things the papers said they did but they haven't had the chance to. Dean thinks, urging the horse to pick up the pace again.

There are more than half a dozen of the posse following him, by the count of the shaky lanterns.

"Damn it," Dean curses under his breath. That's the wrong math, he should have gotten only a third, not almost all of them.

Don't they want to follow the other two? They should have made a bigger name than he already has, according to history.

But meanwhile, Dean finds himself smirking at the fact that if they prefer to follow him, it must mean he has been quite a big deal to whoever recruited them. Then hopefully that's also a big enough noise for Cas.

<br>

He rides into a town by nightfall from the back. The crappy place feels somewhat familiar. The smell of horse dung and sand, the shape of the road and houses along the way.

Dean blinks at the night view of the town, approaching a two-level house that feels the most calling. He gets down from the horse and sneaks in after picking the lock on the door.

And he curses his own stupid mistake.

The sheriff's office where he had briefly been assigned to little more than six months ago. The place where the deputy was shot by the phoenix.

He is back in Sunrise, Wyoming. The town he should never have come back to, considering the demon encounter.

He rushes to the door, and hears the long and painful whinny of his horse when a gunshot unmistakably strikes her.

"I'm so sorry, Baby," Dean puts his head against the doorframe for a second, mourning the loss of the beautiful creature that had accompanied him day and night for months when no one else did.

More clopping sounds rise up outside. Men's rushed footsteps surround the place from all sides. By the sound of all the shouting and yelling, some remain on horseback, circling the building at a trot, others are readying their guns and rifles, the clicks of safeties snapping off loud and clear. There is someone in the lead shouting something, and others answering back with boiling excitement and vengeance. Dean can't make out the words but he can't miss the determination in their voices. These people mean to take him down for good for whatever he did, and he has no escape this time.

He wonders briefly if those people are human or demons, then realizes it makes no difference at all -- they want him dead either way. So very western.

Dean looks around the office, already knowing for sure there is no secret passageway. He could also fight bloody and ugly, go down swinging just like how the movie shows for the ending of great Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Except there will be no freeze frame for him. This is real life, so he would just become a whole body of bullet holes and dead meat. And his mind jumps to a flashing image of a mourning Cas and a crying Sam, eyes red and swollen on both of them; or worse, an image of Cas beaten up and killed by a ruthless archangel, and Sam spending the rest of his life alone and dying of old age here in a shabby hut like Samuel's, in the West, before the twentieth century even begins.

No way out, except flying.

Dean loads all the guns he can find in the place. The pistols and rifles he's gathered with him during all these times, plus some shotguns likely belonging to the new sheriff of the town, stacked against the back wall of the office.

He finds more ammo too, dragging it to the sheriff's desk, just to be prepared.

Finished all these works, he leans against the desk, and closes his eyes.

His fingers are tight around the pistols so he can't quite cross them properly in front of his chest, so he settles with putting them on his lap.

"Castiel, please, I need you," Dean thinks, really thinking hard and desperately like never before, picturing his features in his mind like how he would stand in front of him. He hates the bleeding tone of begging in his prayer, but he can't think of another way, so he keeps it going. "At least come get Sammy and make sure he's safe. October the twenty fourth, 1861, Sunrise, Wyoming. Please --"

And then, like a slow motion moment, unmistakably, there is the most beautiful sound of wings fluttering, the air stirs. Dean gasps in relief before opening his eyes.

"Cas --" he starts, then stops dead. "Who are you?"

The man in front of him is at least five inches taller than him, wearing a uniform, soldier-looking.

The stranger squints at him, and says in a low voice, "You pray too loud. I really don't know why you act like we know each other."

"Castiel," Dean realizes, relieved and tensed at the same time, not sure whether to smile or glare, so he just stares. "I almost forget how big of an asshole you were before."

"As an Angel of the Lord, I come with orders," he declares solemnly. "There are beings who don't belong to this era and who constantly disturb the timeline. I am here to eliminate them. You are one of the three."

"Great, fly me back to my page on the calendar, and problem solved," Dean says, hopefully. Meanwhile -- *Wait, three? Does that mean... Cas? Cas, goddamnit, come in, this is Houston, can you hear me?*

"Wrong, the order is to exterminate the threat to the timeline, not assist them," the Castiel from this era raises his hand, his eyes beginning to glow with angelic light.

Dean dodges aside, having no other way of self-defense but to press the trigger. Bullets won't do him any harm, but hopefully to distract him long enough until he figures something out.

As he dumps the bullets into this Castiel's body, the door is crashed open. He doesn't have time to check if the posse has broken through the barricade he set there, the only thought remaining in Dean's mind is: *I'm gonna die for sure this time*.

Dean's eyes stare at the Angel, the guns in his hands click empty, running out of bullets, and he doesn't dare take his eyes away to reload. Stepping back step by step until his back is pressed to the wall, he keeps clicking the empty guns uselessly, feeling the despair accumulating so much that it chokes him and squeezes his heart dead even before he can get smitten by Castiel.

And then, the lights in Castiel's eyes flicker, dimming as if something is forcing him back down. He looks confused and turns around. There is another man behind him in some old farmer's clothes.

Castiel is visibly surprised, with a growling voice, the lights in the room start shaking, so does the whole building and the ground. The lights blinking, then go out entirely. But a rolling thunder rolls loud, and a flash of lightning shines in the room. A massive shadow of a large pair of black wings spread in the space.

Dean watches, awestruck, his eyes stinging from the brightness of the light, his fingers numb from the force they grip the pistols. He squints his eyes but refuses to look away.

The other man is not intimidated. In the blinding lights that are too dazzling to see, he lights up too. Blue-white light pours from his eyes, flash and thunder follow, then the wings as tremendous as the Angel's, filling the space with equal force.

"Cas," Dean mumbles, the name falling from his lips without hesitation, knowing without doubt it is his Cas, the Cas he has known for three years and been praying to for the whole time he's in here. Here he is, months late, but finally, here he is.

Cas's lights flicker unsteadily for a second at Dean's voice, but he stabilizes himself quickly enough. The old-era western Castiel is still here, menacing, hostile.

"You're the second one on the list," the soldier-Castiel growls.

Cas doesn't answer, his wings flapping, lifting his body higher in the air. The other Castiel follows him, flying toward the ceiling. The sheriff's office is visibly too small for them, but they fight and attack and defend all the same. Fierce and violent.

For a few terrible minutes, Dean thinks his Cas is going to lose. He wrestles and struggles, as if the muscles from his old body are too tired or frail, but then Dean realizes, angels must not be fighting in the vessel forms. The bodies are just here as a representation, the real them must be battling in a dimension he cannot see.

"Cas, come on. This is crazy, it's yourself," Dean wants to help desperately, thinking helplessly. But on the other hand, even if he could do something, wouldn't he be hurting his Cas too if he hurt his older self? He hates timeline dilemmas. He doesn't even know which version of Cas would hear his prayers, or if both would.

He can do nothing but stare and wait. The noise outside of the building -- if those posse and horses are still there besieging him -- can't be heard anymore, drowned out by the thunderous sound of the fighting above him.

And then, the fight ends. Dean's heart thumps into his throat as the room falls still. The dazzling lights go out, and two bodies fall back to the floor slowly, with one in a standing posture, the other horizontal.

"Cas?" Dean blinks hard, trying to get adjusted to the view, desperate to see who is the one left standing. Then he sees it.

It is the Cas he knows, his Cas, in Jimmy Novak's vessel.

His eyes still have glaring angelic lights, his palm pressed on the head of his old self, whose lights are dimming as the grace is extracted and transmitted from the point they touch.

Then the process is over. Cas leaves that soldier's body slumped to the floor. There is no sign of an angel in that nerveless body, no showing of whether the Castiel from this timeline is still in that body or if he's still alive.

Dean stares at him, "Cas?" he gasps, finding his throat choked. "Did you just... kill the other you?"

"No," Cas meets his gaze, and holds it. The familiar stare between them, the one that is soothing, grounding. "I just absorbed the grace I needed, and wiped the memory to avoid any paradox."

Dean gestures toward the lifeless body uncertainly. "Wouldn't that hurt... you? The old you?"

And Cas answers, his tone flat, "He has plenty of time to recover, I don't."

"God, you're cruel to yourself." Dean wipes the corner of his eyes, closing the distance between them, wrapping his arms around Cas tightly, his chin pressed against his shoulder. "Thank goodness you're here. So good to see you again, buddy."

Cas puts his arms around Dean's back, and presses him hard. He swallows, and says quietly, "Hello, Dean."

There is something in his voice that gives Dean a shivering chill. It's too tight, too much forced calm, suppressed and controlled. He pulls back, still keeping a hand on Cas's shoulder. By the sheer light leaking into the room from outside, he checks Cas up and down, frowning at his farmer's shirt and cowboy pants. So uncomfortably perfectly blended in, so human. He looks more disheveled than Dean ever remembers, dirt and dust covering his face and clothes like he's been on the road for so long that the sand of the Wild West has already carved itself into his skin. The look that belongs to all the cowboys of this era.

Dean looks him in the eyes. "Where have you been?"

"When." Cas corrects.

"What?" Dean gasps, slow realization crashing down on him. "How long have you been here?"

"Twenty years."

"Cas --"

"I landed too early, so I had to wait for you to catch up, wait for time to pass the old, slow way," Cas says, in a plain tone.

"I prayed to you, all the time," Dean chokes out.

"I know." Cas's eyes glint with bitterness. "I wish I could have gotten to you sooner."

Dean asks, squeezing his shoulder, trying to steady himself. "What happened?"

#### Act 1

The ranch they pointed him to belongs to the Ludlow family. The father raises three boys, and there is a family of Native Americans as helpers.

Cas learns the way of ranch life fast enough, and spends most of his time with the livestock. They ask if he needs a better place to spend the night, and he tells them he will be fine. He needed some sleep like humans do for the first two or three years, and then it's just long, dark nights after nights, alone, outside the helper's hut, staring at the sky, thinking, wondering. He might have accidentally fallen asleep once in a long while, but the body's need for sleep diminishes as his grace recovers slowly -- agonizingly slow, but he doesn't have anything else to do.

The wings heal slower than the rest of the body, and he can't risk using his grace to help -- not like there is enough of healing power left anyway -- in case the archangel is still scouting the time flux and watching out for the light reflecting from his standout existence that doesn't belong to this era.

So he just lives, and waits. Waiting for the time to pass, second by second, minute by minute, like all humans do, like all of history does. Waiting for his body and true form to recover in the oldest way, like all humans do. Waiting for his strength and grace to grow back.

The little Native American girl grows from a child to a young woman, then comes of age. The Ludlow boys grow fast too. Cas watches them grow from babbling babies to strong young men.

Time is a funny thing. It feels one way when they as angels watch mankind evolve from the top of the clouds and thousands of years pass in a snap, and becomes so utterly a different thing as it flows and moves forward one day after another, then one year after another.

The old man of the Ludlow family passes away at the fifteenth year after Cas joins the ranch. They host a proper funeral in the traditional way. By nightfall, the oldest son plays the harp and the youngest one sings a beautiful song. The second son isn't with them, he's probably in the woods again, looking for bears to fight.

Cas sits at the corner, away from the bonfire and the family, thinking absent-mindedly that the scene feels too familiar. He thinks about Dean, in moments like this. He wonders where Dean is and if he's safe. He checks the time, then the date, then the year. There are still five years to wait, until 1861 comes.

For the whole year of 1860, Cas is restless. He attends to the cows, feeds the chickens and pigs, cleans the stable, brushes the horses, and then, with all the work done, he goes into the woods for a walk. That's what he tells the Ludlows.

He doesn't just take a walk in the woods, he goes deep east. Across the east side of the state line, he goes to South Dakota. He goes to the land where the town of Sioux Falls will be, and he goes to the place where Bobby's house and yard will stand. The place they leave behind, and the place that hasn't been built. The land is undeveloped yet. Cas just stays there, standing in the spot his memory tells him should be the right spot, lowering the body, touching the sand and dirt on the ground, wondering if those exact dirt remains the same for the whole one hundred and fifty years into the future. The solid ground gives him a tiny sense of comfort. But the human heart in his body still beats restlessly, he knows the rings in his true form would be spinning with a similar uneasy speed.

He goes back to the ranch after that. The sun of the new day hasn't risen yet. He goes back to check the stable and the fences, the family in the house, and the Native American family in the helper's hut. The next day is no different.

And then, finally, the year 1861 comes, and March arrives. On the day of March the fourth, 1861, the day he knows Dean and Sam will be in Sunrise, Wyoming, because he would -- had -- dropped them here. Cas goes back to the town, waiting, out of their sight -- things that would have happened to the brothers, Cas doesn't know what will happen if the time flow is disturbed twice, so he decides, it should be safer to avoid the whole paradox by showing up only when he is supposed to.

He goes into the saloon, before noon on the fourth. The bartender Jim Elkins regards him as he walks in. The young man he once was has turned aged and bearded, but the eyes are still sharp. The place smells like horse dung and hay now.

"I remember you," he tells Cas. "You look exactly the same as twenty years ago."

Cas gives him a quick smile. "You have a good memory."

The man looks proud of himself.

Cas books a room with the ranch salary he earned over the past years, with all the extras to pay for those very first few days he was here two decades ago.

He stays on the second floor and decides not to leave the room until high noon on the fifth.

When the footsteps of Dean and Sam walk into the place, when their voices pass to the second floor, it takes him everything not to rush downstairs to meet them.

Cas sits on the bed, closing his eyes, breathing in and out, deep, counting his own heartbeat. He hears Dean complaining about the drink, and saying his own name being "Clint Eastwood." Cas clenches his fist, pinning his body down, reminding himself, *He has waited twenty years, he can wait another day*.

The Judge yells in pain when the phoenix creature burns him alive and the saloon girl screams. The Winchester brothers dash to the second floor. Cas snaps open his eyes. Dean's voice is right next door to his room. He's hidden from his angelic eyes, and the wall blocks his human sight. Cas can't see him, but every atom in his body and every photon in his true form vibrates in anticipation. Dean is *right there*.

Cas thinks he might break the bones in his fist if he clenches any harder.

Every syllable coming from Dean, every word and every sentence, Cas listens to them intently, absorbing them into his memory. He doesn't realize how much he missed it. And he doesn't even know it's possible to miss like this, it almost terrifies him.

He holds himself still, and he hears them leave the room.

The night comes and goes. When the sun rises, a sense of unease starts crawling up. A shade of evil looms over this place, and Cas opens his true eyes to scout.

Elkins enters his room without knocking, and Cas sees the demon's face behind the vessel.

Cas rushes up, manifesting his angel blade into his palm. Two more demons crowd into the room, both taking the form of saloon ladies, another two wait in the hallway.

He swings the blade at the one possessing the poor bartender, the demon smirks harshly. "Careful, don't want to hurt the good old man in here, he's still awake." The eyes of the demon flash back to human for a second, the bartender looks at him in frantic confusion and panic, and then the eyes switch back to the demon's black eyes.

Fighting demons while trying not to harm the possessed human is like disarming a bomb tied to a beating heart.

Cas hides the angel blade away in the pocket dimension, maneuvering between the demons, while murmuring the exorcism in Latin. It's been a while since he last saw a demon, let alone fighting one. The easy pace of ranch life has made him slack. The words stumble and the demons catch him off guard.

They trap him in the Enochian trap painted on the floor, and weaken him with more sigils on the wall. He can do nothing but scowl. He could have been able to break free if he were at his full power, but at the slow rate of recovery, he is no match.

This is a moment Cas wishes Dean could hear him like he hears his prayers.

He hears Dean's voice, talking with Sam.

He hears the sound of the gunshot, and the phoenix burning to ashes.

And he hears the clock bells tolling the tone of high noon.

Cas struggles, but the trap and sigils render him powerless.

Dean's voice comes through in prayer, calling his name, for the many days that followed. Cas hates himself for not being there when Dean needs him.

He breaks free when a fire tears down the whole place. The flames catch his clothes, threatening to burn his vessel. Cas manages to jump out of the window, landing in some bushes. Leaving only scratches on his skin.

The road has a fresh track of horse hooves. The way Dean left. Leading to a place Cas doesn't know.

Cas finds a horse with no owner, and follows the track toward the west.

<br>

#### Act 2

More than ever, Cas misses the human invention of phones. He doesn't like many of the things they call advanced techniques of the last century, but the existence of a phone does make one's life so much easier.

Especially when it comes to finding people hidden from all the angels.

Cas would follow the tracks to where the horse marks disappear into water or bushes, and search the land for hours after hours with no outcome.

Then Dean's prayer would come through, echoing in his brain like a one-directional phone line where he can only listen but has no way to answer.

He misses the times when he could simply dial his number and ask, "Dean, where are you?"

Even though, Dean doesn't always seem pleased to see him drop by. He complains a lot, especially if it's during his sleep time. But Cas decides, it's just how the human is, and he misses that too.

<br>

He loses Dean's track somewhere near the state line between Utah and Arizona. No new bank reported to have been robbed for a while around the area, Cas goes back to the last town he knows Dean has visited -- Pinecrest, Utah.

A wanted poster with a sketch of Dean's profile is newly attached outside the bank's door, under the name of "Clint Eastwood."

Cas stands there staring at the image. The sketch isn't accurate, the stubbles and freckles are wrong, but the eyes are vivid. He looks into the eyes, having a weird feeling that the eyes have their own lives and can see through him, knowing all the dirty little secrets that are eating him up.

Cas shifts uneasily, but he can't take his eyes away. His gaze follows the jawline of his figure, and the shape of his nose, before landing back onto the eyes that are black and white in the image. He thinks about the emerald color of his eyes.

One of the bank guards walks out, asking if he has seen the man.

Cas blinks once, and says no.

"He's actually charming as an outlaw," the guard recalls. "Very polite." He shows Cas his wrist, where there are no marks. "See? They didn't even tie me up."

Cas can't hold back a small smile, and tells the guard, "I've heard they are good men."

The guard nods once, and moves back to the bank.

Cas tears down the poster when no one is looking, and takes it with him.

<br>

He learns to check the newspapers to find new updates about "Clint Eastwood" and his gang.

Though after a while, he realizes they are always either outdated or fake.

A bank is reported to be robbed in Rattlesnake Bend, Nevada. Cas rides into the town, but the town is safe and sound from any robbery for over a month.

He doubts Dean would ever kill anyone if they're not monsters, but when the newspaper says Clint Eastwood has shown up in Cattle Creek, Kansas with a body count, he still goes there to check it out, just in case.

It is near the end of summer, Kansas is still hot and dry. People in the town wear ridiculously large cowboy hats to shield themselves from the sun. The saloon is called Skinny's Saloon. The man behind the bar counter is exactly as the name suggests.

Cas approaches him to ask if a cowboy with his height and green eyes has ever visited. Skinny raises a pistol at him as soon as he hears the question.

Cas tilts his head at the man's reaction, wondering what it is that he's done wrong.

"Who are you?" Skinny demands, "His friend or enemy?" He holds the pistol in the right hand, the left hand hanging limp and shaky by his side, that side of his shoulder twitching uncontrollably.

Cas considers, and he says, "Nobody. I just want to find him." At the man's doubtful gaze, Cas manages to add, "He is wanted, isn't he? There are posters about him."

Skinny lowers his gun and huffs a laugh, "Ah, bounty hunter."

Cas nods at that, "So? Is he here or not?"

Skinny says, with much disappointment. "He's not. I'd hoped he'd come visit once he saw the paper, but he never did. Only dumbasses like you popping up."

"You want to trick him here? Why?" Cas squints. This man is not a demon, but who says demons have to come from hell.

Skinny points at his wounded left shoulder. "Thunderhill, Colorado. That bastard put a bullet in here." He grinds his teeth. "Ever heard about a cowboy's revenge? This ain't over until he's dead."

"You're going to kill him?" Cas tenses.

"Sure I do." Skinny smirks. "If no one else does it before me."

Cas stands up, leaning on the counter, speaking one word at a time, dead serious. "I can't let you do that."

"What, because you want all the bounty to yourself? Go ahead, kill him first then." Skinny glances at him carelessly. "Or do you want to settle it the old way?"

Cas wants to ask what old way, but glancing down, he sees the man has already picked up the pistol again, pointing it in his direction. He gets it easily.

"Old way, then," Cas says grimly.

They take the fight outside.

Noon, main street. There are people watching.

Cas had his gun belt back when he was three states away, because he realized people tend to ask more questions if he doesn't have one.

His fingers hover at the edge of the gun, his eyes locked straight on the skinny cowboy's. The cowboy is sweating heavily.

For a second, Cas feels bad for him, but the next second, he remembers his venomous tone of hatred when he said, "Sure I do," about killing Dean.

Cas's eyes turn cool as ice. He draws the gun and shoots the man in the chest. The man barely has a chance to draw his gun and already falls to the ground, dead.

Cas puts the gun back to the holster. Not liking the way the crowd looks at him, as if he's some kind of hero. He just killed a man, he thinks bitterly, though he has no choice.

He leaves Kansas quickly.

The gun is pressed against his thigh, still feeling hot. Cas wonders if Dean will have to kill any man during these western times.

<br>

#### Act 3

The town in California is also a fool's errand. The mine that was said to be robbed, they never had any gold to begin with. Upon Cas's very persuasive inquiry, the mine owner admits it was just a way to keep the miners' minds at peace.

"Clint Eastwood is just a convenient name to put," the man murmurs.

"And why is that?"

"Oh, because he's gonna die soon, we can just say the gold is gone with him." The mine owner shrugs. "The railway companies have been recruiting the best men to join a posse to go after him and his gang. They have the best trackers who can find any man in the whole world like a rabbit in a hole. Think the railway can't take any more robbery losses now."

Cas scowls at the news and lets the man go. "Where can I find this posse?"

"Try Thunderhill, Colorado. Heard the sheriff there volunteered. Probably a personal grudge."

The town name rings a bell. Didn't that skinny bartender and saloon owner say he's from the same place?

Cas urges the horse onward as he rides across the land toward Colorado, wondering just how much trouble Dean has gotten himself into back in Colorado.

<br>

Cas finds the posse the night before they head out. The town sheriff, Little Bill, is counting heads. They are one person short of a dozen, so Cas makes it to the last spot.

Little Bill tells them a story at the saloon many months ago, and how ruthless Clint Eastwood was when he murdered men and humiliated women. The story sounds nothing like Dean, but everyone in the posse gets so motivated that they all shout damnation to this Clint Eastwood they've never met and eager to head out hunting the man down.

Cas wants nothing more than to yell at these credulous men, telling them how wrong they are and how misleading those stories are. But if he did, then he would for sure get kicked out of the posse with no way to find Dean again, all while a group of cowboys hunts him down like hounds chasing hares.

He bites his lips to keep from showing any sign of disapproval on his face.

"You with us, Novak? Hunt the man down and kill him by all means?" Little Bill stares at him when he doesn't jump up and down like the others.

Cas forces a quick smile and nods. "Yes, by all means."

<br>

The Indian trackers are indeed exceptional at keeping up with the trail.

Sometimes when there are absolutely no tracks to his eyes, both his human eyes and true eyes, the Indians can still give them clear directions to go.

They pick up the day-old trace from Nevada, moving southeast, then follow all the way to New Mexico.

Cas thinks he catches a glimpse of three horses on top of a mountain, hundreds of miles away. One of the figures is so familiar that his heart skips a beat. But when they reach that spot, the men are another hundred miles away again, like a fleeting mirage.

Cas wonders if he's hallucinating their figures.

They keep moving. So do they.

When they are back to Colorado, the Indians tell Little Bill the traces split into two paths.

The sheriff curses. "They must've separated."

Cas asks, "Which way has fewer people?"

The Indians point the way to north.

Cas urges his horse in that pointed direction. "I'm going that way." He states, quietly hoping the group will also split, and that fewer will choose to follow Dean.

Which, of course, turns out one's wish is never granted, as their luck always goes.

<br>

As the hint of winter closes in, they follow the trail to a town in Wyoming.

Cas recognizes the town the moment they roll in -- Sunrise, Wyoming, where all the messy trouble starts. He never thought he'd be back here again. The saloon building has been rebuilt in the past months. No sign to show the old one has been burnt down in a fire.

Dean is cornered in the sheriff's office. Flickering lights show his silhouette on and off, switching between windows. Cas watches him, thinking this is the closest they've ever been since the last time they were both in this town.

Dean's prayer reaches him, pained and desperate, asking for him. With the distance so close, they can probably hear each other if they just speak loudly enough.

Cas gets off his horse, and tells the sheriff he'll go in there first. Alone.

Little Bill eyes him. "He'll shoot you like a walking sieve."

Cas answers plainly, "Maybe he will, maybe he won't."

Little Bill regards him closely, up and down, as if taking his shabby clothing and his beard in for the first time. "You know him, don't you? That's why you want to join. Probably never even thought about killing him for once. Who are you to him, a lover?"

Cas keeps his face stoic, standing still. Keeping his eyes on the sheriff's office. Dean's prayer continues, so more than half his attention is taken away from the conversation before him.

The man smirks, reaching for his gun, swinging it casually at him. "Maybe you're just making all our lives easier, we can lure him out without a fight."

The rest of the posse starts moving toward him. The men and the horses circle around him.

"Don't," Cas warns them, jaw tight, eyes flicking between them and where Dean is.

They laugh, tightening the circle, their backs to the sheriff's office.

There is a sudden burst of glaring light from inside the sheriff's office, the air vibrates with electricity. At the very same moment, guns go off, and Dean's prayer hitches.

Cas turns around sharply, drawing his gun at the posse. They draw theirs, firing at the same time.

Bullets hit him, back and leg and arm, warm blood streaming down, but Cas keeps standing, continuing to fire. The other men are surprised, soon terrified. Some of them see the wounds that would surely kill a man but not even slow him down, they rise to their horses, wanting to flee. Cas shoots their legs and they fall to the ground in loud moaning, until no men are left standing.

Little Bill falls from his horse too, crawling desperately with a wounded leg, as Cas walks toward him, pointing a gun at his face. The man widens his eyes in horror. Cas pulls the trigger, the man flinches violently. But the gun is empty. Cas pulls it again, and Little Bill flinches again, more shakenly. For three pulls, Cas watches the horror growing in the man's eyes, shaking like a leaf in the winter gust. Cas throws the empty gun at him, then hurries toward the sheriff's office.

The barricaded door is easy to break through, the light inside the room is blinding to any human. But to Cas, the shapes are familiar. One belongs to Dean, the other to his old self.

Dean is on the ground, backing up, holding himself, both of the guns in his hand are out of bullets. His old self is preparing for a deadly strike.

Cas tears him away from Dean, unfolding his own true form. The wings are barely healed, the new bullet wounds slow his vessel down, but Dean is here. If he loses, it would mean his old self -- if he keeps following the orders as he knows he would -- is going to kill Dean. *He*, would be the one who causes Dean's death. And Cas can't allow that to happen.

He fights like there is no future, and his old self is no match. Drinking in his own grace, he knows his past self would be wounded for decades, maybe centuries, but he's here now, with no memory of this encounter, which means there is no consequence too severe to bear. He drains his past self and wipes the memory, sending him back to Heaven.

Like he told Dean, his past self has the luxury of healing slowly, he doesn't.

The new grace he just absorbed heals him well completely, both his body and true form growing strong and complete.

Cas turns to Dean, finally. Finally.

*It's been a long time.* He thinks, breathing out long in relief. *You have no idea how long it has been. And I finally found you.*

He says none of that, only to hold the man tight, with all his strength but careful enough not to break him.

Dean's breath is uneven over his shoulder. They hold each other like that, just breathing together, in the same space, in the same time, one hundred and fifty years too early, hundreds of thousands of miles too far. And yet, they are at ease.

Breathing in, breathing out. The warm and solid touch under his hands. The bone, the muscle, the skin; the hair, the stubble, the freckles.

Cas scrutinizes him once they pull apart. The face and look that are all so familiar, but the long beard and new wrinkles creased by the western sand and wind make the face new and mature. The eyes trained on his, sparkling with glitter.

Eventually, Cas decides, that all he can say is just, "Hello, Dean."

### Chap.7 (reunion, go home)(Sunrise+Bobby's, 1861+2011, Dean POV+Cas)

> **Outline:** Cas heals Dean and himself, Dean caring, Cas only hints the last 20y are tough but not enough detail (some talk, Dean's imagined ranch life with Cas)
>
> Cas flies them home (pick Sam up), back to the same day they leave for the phoenix's ashes. Bobby is still there, exactly the same as before, everything the same. (Or not exactly, Dean's western fame gets kept in history, legends of himself becomes a cowboy story, exaggerated but he's amused, secretly really love it)

The sound of his last question dangles in the air, floating there for a few extended seconds, before falling gradually to the ground like a flying feather drifting down.

*What happened, Cas?* Dean's eyes meet his, can't help wondering how many things these eyes have seen in the last twenty years -- how many beautiful things, and how many ugly things.

Cas is quiet. Too quiet. With the eyes too deep and blue, swirling like ocean water.

*Tell me, please.* Dean thinks hard, seeing Cas's eyes widen slightly, realizing the thought must have been conveyed through the prayer accidentally.

"It's... not easy," Cas murmurs, his voice husky and reluctant. "But it's gone now, so it doesn't matter." His eyes flicker to the outside of the door. Some outlines of dead and wounded men can be seen from where they stand. The moonlight is bright tonight.

"No, it matters," Dean tells him, his voice adamant. "It matters to me."

It's a long tale. From the day they left Bobby's place until now. It almost feels like a lifetime ago. That life where they fought another apocalypse and asshole demons and archangels, feels like a long dream that is slowly fading in the memory while this one, the wild lands, the gang Dean befriended over months, the ranch Cas worked in for years, this feels so real now.

Cas finishes his story, and Dean finishes telling his. They let the aftertaste linger, stretching on the tip of the tongue.

"It's a difficult life," Dean says slowly.

Cas nods quietly.

They are sitting by the sheriff's desk now, pulling the two chairs close, their knees touching. Dean's fingers absent-mindedly fumble with the new sheriff's pin on the desk -- whoever it belongs to now.

"But also a simple one," Dean adds, remembering the vast landscape in front of him, infinite. The edge of the ocean can't be seen from there. On horseback, on this land, he is free.

"The life on the ranch is also simple," Cas admits. "Quiet. Too quiet you might find it boring. That's probably why old Ludlow's second son has to go into the woods looking for bears to fight."

Dean chuckles. "Sounds like someone I'd like to meet."

Cas smiles with him. "Yes, I think you'll like him. You'll like all of them."

Silence falls between them again. Calm and comfortable. They just sit there, with only moonlight filtering through broken windows and the door.

They're not eager to go anywhere, or any time. They've spent too long getting to this point, at least they've earned a moment to catch their breath.

Dean's mind wanders to the ranch in Cas's words. He doesn't need to see the place to know it must be something Cas would enjoy. The livestock and the wildlife, the creatures and the woods. The growing kids, girls and boys growing to become fine ladies and gentlemen -- or wild girls and uncivilized hunters, if they choose to.

They could live there, own a small hut of their own, take possession of a small corner of the ranch. They could tend to the land and watch the sunset from the porch. The air would smell like wood and grass, their hands weathered from farm work instead of gunfire. Dean blinks hard, thinking, *that doesn't even sound half bad*. Sam is welcome to stay, or find another ranch of his own with someone he enjoys spending time with. They could just live normal, quiet lives, and probably die of boredom, old age, or too much healthy natural food, sometime around the turn of the twentieth century. Dean finds himself not mind that they would not even live to the day that the Impala is produced or the day Led Zeppelin starts their touring. With Cas, and Sam, safe and happy with him, there isn't much else to ask for. Dean smiles.

"What are you thinking?" Cas breaks the silence.

"I might miss this place," Dean tells him.

"We don't have to go," Cas offers, genuinely.

"I know." But Dean already starts standing up from the seat, holding out a hand to pull Cas to his feet too.

He reaches for the glass of phoenix ash that has been tucked inside his inner pocket. Shaking it to show the contents, making his point clear. "We came here for this, and we got it. The world back home still needs saving. Don't want to keep Bobby waiting for too long, do we?"

Cas nods, then chews his tongue. Dean watches him. Cas sighs deeply. "There is something I should have let you know a long time ago. I've had twenty years to think it over, and time does have the magic to clear one's mind."

The wild land of the West is plain and straightforward, so it is how it makes them. No more lies, no more secrets. No more hide and seek, no more chase and run.

Cas confesses -- the deal with the demon, the war with the archangel, the messy things among angels, the friends and enemies, all the concerns and worries, all the things he thought he could contain in his head -- They flood out under the moonlight in the Wild West, in front of Dean's eyes.

The wind and sand hear them. The night is long and quiet.

Cas breathes out, waiting for a furious blow. Only to find Dean's look intense, but not angry.

"We'll figure this out, together. Later." Dean says. Then, "Now let's pick up Sam and go home."

<br>

They find Sam at Samuel's place, as expected. The two of them are adding extra sigils to the hut. They argue a lot, just like all the familiar bickering with Bobby. The squabbles are sour and bitter, but funny in their own way. Their heads lean close over a sigil on one of the books, immediately starting to argue about the correct interpretation. They paint the symbol together, trying some ritual and magical experiments, unsurprised to see them not working. Then they move on to test the next theory. The bottle of whiskey on Samuel's writing desk is emptied, there are two glasses there.

Sam hates to leave as much as back when he was still in school and Dean or their Dad had to tell him they were moving again.

Sam pouts his lips in protest, patting Samuel on the shoulder at their farewell.

The old legendary hunter pats him back on the same spot. Not saying anything, but standing by the hut's door, waving.

Dean almost feels bad for him.

<br>

They are back at Bobby's place in the blink of an eye. Landing on the date of April the twenty fifth, 2011, precisely. Minutes after Cas woke up from Bobby's couch and flew away from the place.

"So the time dimension this round, it's easy to fly?" Dean murmurs low, low enough for only Cas to hear, as their feet touch the ground again.

"Yes." Cas nods slightly by his side, steadying his stumbling footsteps from the landing.

Dean squints at him, checking him over. There is a fresh new tear on the back of his trench coat, but no sign of blood or wound.

Dean raises an eyebrow at the tear while Sam strides over to hug and greet Bobby. Cas murmurs under his breath, "It is not of import. I'm fine, Dean, Raphael missed, I'm faster this time. We're safe, for now."

Dean is relieved slightly, turning to hug Bobby so tightly that the old hunter grumbles.

"Alright, alright, sappy," Bobby pats his back a few times. "No need to grow girl parts, it's just three days."

"Oh," Dean stills, remembering that's true for him.

Bobby looks exactly the same as before, as he should. So does this room, or the state, or the world. Except for them.

Bobby takes them in -- Dean has his long cowboy beard and wrinkles from dry wind and sand; Sam changes the least, only with longer and messier hair; and Cas, almost totally a new different being, in his overhuman-like ranch and cowboy clothing, and a weather-beaten look in his eyes. Bobby squints at them. "You better tell me everything."

So they do.

<br>

Then, the old life comes back. The old demon-hunting, monster-killing life that Dean's grown up with. They make plans, they hunt down Eve, they deal with Crowley, they handle Raphael. They work on saving the world every other Tuesday.

Sam jumps right back into the old routine as if the months in the Wild West never left a mark on his memory. But Dean thinks, in between the monster-hunting and world-saving, when he exchanges a glance with Cas, he knows something will never be the same ever again.

Sometimes at night, when he lies in a motel bed, staring at the ceiling, wide awake, he finds it easy to imagine the current life a dream, the memory a reality. They could all still be in the Wild West, and the whole world-saving thing is just one long dream to wake up from.

He might as well be lying in a saloon room in an old town, cowboys on horseback stomping noisily down the floor, the smell of animal dung mixed with saloon ladies' perfumes filling the air, music drifting through the thin wooden walls.

He could still feel the wind from the old western time blowing through his hair, the land vast, the world open to explore. Dean allows himself to imagine the life they never had: Cas on the ranch, busy and happy, wearing a cowboy hat. They sit in the corner of a saloon on Friday nights, listening to the town folks playing old-time music, dancing and singing, happy and peaceful. All the while Cas by his side. Dean breathes, feeling the air calm and easy, the smell of dust is the taste of raw nature and freedom.

A life they never had, but an option always open. That night, under the moonlight, in the quiet moment, when he looks Cas in the eyes, Dean knows the answer to an unasked question, would be yes. He knows.

*What if we just, stay. Here and now. Us.*

A life in the past, could be their future.

The one thing they really want, is the one thing they could have.

Dean breathes slowly and deeply, closing his eyes in the quiet night.

Maybe they will, *one day*. When all is done, maybe they will.

They will have a banjo, Cas will have a harp. The music will be beautiful, so will the dance. People will be laughing, they will be holding each other close, enjoying the moment. The comfortable wind of the Wild West flow gently by. They will hold each other's gaze, so close they could see their own reflections. Cas will look at him like there is nothing else in the world, the way he always did. Dean thinks his own eyes might just be the same.

They will be happy. Content. Home.

Dean decides, he wants nothing more.

He falls asleep with a peaceful smile.

~~Major rewrites!! don't like it, too emotionally remote and abrupt, and spoil the future events → pretend only knows so far until S06E18, but give hopeful ending that *maybe* when all is done, that's the thing they can have, there will be peace in the end~~
