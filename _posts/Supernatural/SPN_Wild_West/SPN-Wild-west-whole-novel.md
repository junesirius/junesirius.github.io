"The further back I send you, the harder it becomes to retrieve you. 24 hours is all I can risk. If I don't pull you home within that time, you'll be lost to me."

Jim Elkins at the Slick Jim's Saloon (been here longer than God) <= Cas meets him 20y ago

## Main

### Act 1

> **Outline:** Dean&Sam gets phoenix's ash by noon, bell rings, but Cas doesn't come, they can't get back. Some more time passes, they realize something must have happened to Cas and now they get stuck in the Frontierland and have to figure out what to do. They start living like the locals, blend in as cowboys, get used to it, Dean is the town sheriff.

Eyes unblinking, gun raised, not for a split second Dean thinks he might be too slow. Then the gunshot sound echoes, the phoenix burns with bright golden light and turns into a pile of ashes.

He still gets this. Dean beams to himself.

The clock bells the tone of high noon. Sound shaking him out of the mist of contentment.

"Dean! The ashes!" Sam yells behind him, following by several steps.

Dean dashes to the ashes, glass bottle ready in head, tip opened. The ashes fill into the bottle before the minute ends.

He lets out a breathe, regarding the glassful of ashes, shaking the bottle slightly, closes the lid. Right on time. Mission complete.

The minute passes. No stir in the air.

Dean glances back at Sam, both frowning.

The hands on the wall clock are ticking.

"Where's Cas?" Sam voices the question in his mind, hesitant, uneasy.

Dean gives him a tight smile, checking the clock again. Five minutes passed. "Dude might be busy," he says. "Give him another minute."

Castiel does not show up in the next minute, or the next five. Or ten.

Dean starts pacing, looking at the sky, half praying half just speaking to the empty air in front of him. "Hey Cas? Forget to check the watch or something? Time to pick us up."

He looks around. The town is still the western town they spent the last twenty four hours in, Sunrise, Wyoming. Not Bobby's place, definitely not Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Something is not right.

"Dean," Sam says slowly, pointing out the obvious. "Cas's never late for anything."

"He has wings, he can literally fly to any time anywhere, 'cause he'd never be late for anything." Dean says, staring at the clock with even more attention than he had with the phoenix during the duel.

"Then why do you think...?" Sam doesn't have to finish his sentence.

"I don't know." Dean forces out a breath, pushing down the uneasiness in his gut. "Let's just wait inside. Maybe he'll come just in a bit."

<br>

They sit by the sticky bar table in the Saloon. Elkins pours them each a glass of beer -- still tasting like horse piss but Dean manages to let it slide down the throat. If he has to stay here longer, might as well start getting used to it.

"You boys alright?" Elkins eyes them while cleaning a glass with a piece of brown yellow clothes god knows has been used for how long.

Dean swallows the liquid. "Yeah, yeah," he says, forcing a smile. "Just waiting for a friend to come by."

"Someone late for the date night?" the bartender reads his face, half joking.

"You can say that." Dean's too lazy to retort.

<br>

The saloon has some bar food too, they use them as the dinner.

The night soon falls on them. There is still no sign of Cas.

"You want to, umm," Sam shifts in the bar stool next to him. "Find a place for the night?"

Dean checks the watch. It's been ten hours.

He empties the glass and stands up. "Yeah ok, let's go."

There is no motel or anything similar in the town, of course -- apparently they don't get many outsiders. But the sheriff's office is empty. With both the sheriff and the deputy down, that place is just a whole big empty room waiting to be claimed.

Dean leads them back in there. The deputy's charred skeleton is still behind the bar, the air burnt flesh. Dean decides to not think about that for now. He wanders around the place, looking for anything available to claim for their use.

"You seem to fit the place well enough." Sam observes.

Dean gives him a look, fingering the sheriff's pin on his shirt. "You kidding me? I'm officially the sheriff in town, so yeah, this is legitimately my place now, 'course I fit in here."

"Not just in here," Sam amends the comment. "Everything, the shirt, the duel, the horse. People might actually buy in that you're from this time."

Slow understanding starts kicking in. Dean looks up from the lost-and-found bucket he's been scrounge, squinting, "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying," Sam pauses, looking him in the eyes, considering the words carefully. "We might have to stay here for quite some time, might as well blend in."

"No, no," Dean straightens up. "Cas is going to be here shortly. Maybe not tonight short, but tomorrow or something. He -- he won't keep us waiting for too long."

If he says it with enough confidence, he can convince himself too, isn't it?

"Then how long?" Sam pulls a mocking smile. "You don't even believe it yourself."

Dean breaks the gaze, impatient. "So what? You think Cas's gonna just dump us in here? In the middle of the wild, right on the edge of the Civil War?"

"Thought you'd like that," Sam says, easing around, grabbing a chair to sit down. "Isn't it your dream life? Since like six?"

Dean is muted for a second, frowning at him. "What? No! Yeah? I mean -- not like this!"

He trails off, giving their surrounding a quick look around. The bars, the officer's wooden desk, a couple chairs, the walls with peeling paper, some random jacket and whip or something scattering around. The air smells dust and horse.

"Not like this." He lands on it, going back to check the drawers under the desk. "Cas will come, I assure you. Just give him a bit time. He'll come. He always do."

"What if he can't? What if something happened to him, and he's... he's too weak to time travel, or even dead?"

"Don't say that!" Dean snaps, jerking his head from behind the desk, glaring at his brother. "Nothing's gonna happen to him, alright? Dude gets his full power back, new and improved, and he's leading a full army Upstairs! Must be just in the middle of war prepping meeting or something." He glances at the ceiling reflectively, as if he can see the Upstairs like that.

"I'm just being realistic," Sam says in a calm but worried voice. "Why else would he be late? We both know he's in a war and Raphael is on his tail. And we have no idea how bad the things are with his war, I mean, not really. That lieutenant angel, Rachel or something? Says they're in a bad position, isn't it? We didn't even ask how bad."

"Cas is fine." That's all Dean can think of to say. He swallows, closing the eyes for a second and reopening. He doesn't know that, but that's the only thing he can say. Only thing he has to hold on to. "He survives so many apocalypses before, surely Raphael can't be worse than Lucifer, right?"

He didn't mean to bring up the Lucifer thing, that time no more than a year ago when Cas was face to face with *both* Michael and Lucifer, right before he got exploded by the Devil. He flinches, the power of archangel has always been just an expression in his mind that he doesn't give much thought to, but what if...

He shakes his head, dragging himself away from that train of thought. "We don't know anything, so let's not freak ourselves out just by thinking about the worst, eh? Now, move your ass over here and help me find if there's some blanket or something around for the night."

<br>

"You boys still hanging around?" Elkins gives them a nod while serving some other town folks. "Thought you'd move on by now."

"Believe me, we want to, but eh.. still waiting for the ride." Dean gives him one of those convincing smiles he has perfected over the years with the case victims and authorities.

"There are a few spare horses around here if it's a ride you want." The bartender offers, being as kindly as any old western man can be.

"Uh, we actually..." Sam starts.

"You know what, that would be awesome." Dean cuts him off, smiling brightly at the old man.

They use the gold they bring along to pay off the food and drink. Not getting any suspicious look.

"I'd give this one to Bobby." Dean murmurs under breath when they walk out of the saloon. "Era of no plastic but all gold, I wouldn't know what to do if we don't have those."

The bag of gold is still heavy on his shoulder. The weight of wealth and reassurance.

Sam scoffs. "No credit card fraud or pooling this time."

Dean looks back over his shoulder, eyes sprinkling with cunning joy. "Ha, but there's still poker. You never know what skill could come handy or even save our ass some time a hundred fifty years in the past, don't you, Sammy?"

Sam shakes his head, laughing.

<br>

The horses Elkins pointed to them belonged to the passed Judge and old Sheriff. One beautiful black horse with furs so bright and smooth it almost reminds him of the Impala.

"Hey baby," Dean strokes its back, voice gentle, love flowing from his eyes, "you miss me?"

"Dean, I don't think she'd ever known you." Sam snorts.

Dean gives him a stern look, "You don't know that." He shifts the attention back to the beauty, its muscle strong and warm under his palm. "We might have met in our previous lives or something. Tell me she's not exactly like Baby to you?"

Sam tilts his head, regarding the horse, tip of his lips twists. "Hmm." he has to agree.

The other tan brown horse with a white stripe on the nose decides to throw its temper at Sam for a few moments when he approaches, but eventually lets him tie the saddle on and pats on the back.

<br>

They don't really have anywhere in mind to go, with the horses. But they are still over delighted to have them. Dean, especially.

A few days later, when he's grooming the Baby -- of course he has to name it after the real Baby -- Sam tells him, chuckling, "You have any idea how much it's like watching you wash the car?"

Dean doesn't look back from his busy work by hand, "I don't know, Sam, just the me in the other life, I guess."

Sam's chuckle stops. The silence makes Dean glance back.

"What?" he asks, slowing down the handwork.

"I didn't even realize how settled in we already are, like we're actually already in another life." Sam frowns. "Almost forget to count how many days it's been, since..."

"Since March the fifth," Dean says for him. "Since the day the phoenix died and Cas was supposed to meet us up, yeah I remember. Kinda hard to forget, isn't it?"

The glass bottle of phoenix ash is still tucked under his jacket, just in case if he has to be pulled away in a hurry, he'd make sure the reason why they're here in the first place wouldn't get lost.

Sam swallows, giving Dean a quick glance, a little sheepishly, "So is it time we finally start talking about what to do if Cas never come, if he just can't, and we might have to figure out our own way back?"

Dean stares at him, face grim, brows knitted tight. Eventually he sighs, giving in the stare, licking his lips. "Ok, yeah, you might be right. Can't put all the burden on the man, he might even need our help back home."

### Act 2-1

> **Outline:** Cas passes out for longer than in canon, when he comes to it's past 24h and he's super weak and wounded. He doesn't want to risk Bobby's soul and can't leave the boys behind, but also like he mentioned, now they are lost to him, so he'd have to fight hard in the time flux to find them. He's in no condition to time travel but he worries about Dean too much so he risks flying into the time flux in his wounded state, leaving bloody trace behind. His trace exposes him, Raphael follows him into the time flux, so he has to escape the chase while tries to locate Dean, Cas crash lands in Sunrise Wyoming but Dean's not there.

Bobby paces the living room, a few steps in front of the sofa where a bleeding out angel passed out.

"Balls." it might be the hundredth or thousandth time he curses. He doesn't bother counting.

The countdown on the clock is running out fast. Cas doesn't show any sign of waking up.

Bobby frowns deep, throwing looks between the clock and Cas every second.

Cas crashes into the kitchen little more than three hours ago, leaving a bloody sigil on the fridge door, and practically goes straight into the coma. No explanation.

"Balls." Bobby curses under his breath, staring at the unconscious angels.

The timer also hits zero. The boys would be waiting in the goddamn wild west a hundred fifty years in the past, the only angel in the room is not waking up. Both waiting for him to save the day, what's he gonna do, wrapping a wing that's never there?

"Ok Cas, don't smite me or anything," Bobby approaches the sofa carefully, thinking twice, then shaking Cas's shoulder. First not so much harshly, then a lot more. But still, the eyes are closed, the cut on his abdomen is bleeding some ominous bright light.

Bobby slaps his face -- also lightly first, all things considered, then a lot less so. But nothing works.

Bobby runs out of idea.

"Balls" is not enough for him given the circumstance. He'd need a stronger word.

<br>

There might be a spell or something useful in the books. Bobby jumps back into the familiar realm, diving into the lore and magic, looking for something that may remotely give some hope, of either bringing the boys home by himself or waking up the angel.

He did wrap a bandage on Cas's abdomen, trying vainly to stop the angelic bleeding. Not gonna do anything to the celestial creature in his true form, sure, Bobby knows that too, but maybe healing the vessel might just help him recover a little bit faster? With nothing by hand, all he can do is hope.

And pray.

He has to pray for all of them now. But if not to Cas, to whom?

Glancing at the bloody sigil with Cas's fingerprint that is visibly gradually drying out, it can be a big mistake. Bobby downs a glass of whiskey before doing that.

"Well, call me stupid but none of you here stopping me, so here goes nothing." Bobby looks up at the ceiling.

"Whatever angel out there," he says, grumpily, can't decide whether to keep the eyes open or shut, settled with squinting, "uh, hope you're on our side. Could use a little help here."

The sigil on the fridge door brightens up, burning into a bright golden color, similar to the leaking light from inside Cas, then dying out slowly. It might look a little shallower than before, Bobby observes, not knowing what it means.

No angel shows up. Not sure if it's good or bad news.

Bobby turns back to the books for help.

<br>

Bobby doesn't close his eyes in the first night. The letters on the pages start swimming.

Castiel is still not responding to anything. Face pale, body cold.

Bobby examines his wound -- while murmuring "I don't have a goddamn PhD in angelic medics, just so you know" -- the cut is still deep, the leaking light is blinding, but Bobby decides it's not as blinding as yesterday. Not sure if it's hopeful thinking or his eyes are just getting adjusted to angel grace.

He sighs long and deep. "Should have talked them out of this, told you it's a bad idea, but who'd listen?"

The next day passes in the book and regular check with the angel. So is the day after.

Bobby is getting increasingly desperately. "Never thought I'd lose the boys like this, even before they're born."

He slams Castiel's collar, shaking him a lot more violently. "You gotta wake up, Cas." his voice practically pleading. "Dean's waiting for you! Sam's waiting for you!"

Cas lets out a pained groan.

Bobby puts him down. "Cas?"

Castiel wakes up a few more hours later, exhaling sharply. Eyes opening slowly, staring straight into the space in front of him, blank, then onto Bobby's screwed face, confused.

He frowns deep, trying to pull himself up from the sofa but wobbly so much that he crashes back down the minute he puts the weight on the legs.

"There he is." Bobby breathes out, not exactly relieved but at least feels lighter than the past seventy something hours. He lends a hand to help Cas balance.

"What happened?"

Castiel gets rid of the bandage, palm covering the wound. The light is still leaking from between his fingers. He tells him, "I was, uh... I was attacked, betrayed by one of our own."

"Should see the other guy, right?" Bobby tries putting a light tone there.

Castiel probably doesn't get the reference, he answers anyway. "Rachel, she was killed. But I was wounded. Need to use some safety, so... thank you."

"You mean that finger painting?" Bobby eyes the sigil that he has stared for so many times over the past few day. It's barely visible now. Only a light bloody stain, mudged.

Cas follows his eyes, frowning deeper. "Is there any other angels coming around this place while I was out?" he glares at Bobby.

Bobby shrugs. "Not that I know of."

Cas looks into him, saying gravely. "Did you... pray to them?"

Bobby tilts his head, having a bad feeling but has to defend himself. "Well, you're out, boys need a ride home, what else was I supposed to do? So yeah, distress call."

Cas looks like he was about to snap, but decides at the last minute to turn it into a sigh. "You might just put both of us in more danger, me, especially. Since Raphael might already find where I am, or at least close enough. I could be dead any minute by now if it's not still shielding me."

Bobby steps back half a step, giving Cas some space as he tries to give another attempt to stand up. "Well, I'm sorry. I guess. Was really out of option there."

"How long was I unconscious?" Cas leaves the sofa, walking shakily toward the desk.

"Three days, give or take." Bobby answers, without having to check the time. "Now would really be a good time to bring the boys home now. Should have enough fun in the Frontierland."

"I can't." Cas drops his head, facing away from Bobby.

"Come again?"

"The fight... it drained me." Cas shifts his feet. Uneasy. "And it's been too long. They're lost to me already."

Bobby stares at his back, snapping. "Then found them! You can't just leave Sam and Dean in the past like that!"

"I know." Castiel turns back, looking at Bobby in the eyes, solemnly. "So I'll still go, and try, but I don't know what's the chance. If I don't make it back..." he breaks the gaze, "please know that I'm really sorry and I mean it."

With that, and a disturbance of wind flow in the room, Castiel is gone.

"What--" Bobby steps two steps ahead, right next to where the angel was, but it is so clear there is nothing there anymore.

### Act 2-2



### Act 3

> **Outline:** Dean prays to Cas but doesn't get answer, they figure Cas said they're lost to him, so their idea is to do something "noisy" (big enough to get some notice from the future but not too big to disturb the history) so that their existence might be like some beacon in the timeline, hopefully making it easier for Cas to locate them. They leave Sunrise Wyoming (cuz demons find them), Dean quits sheriff, the two boys ride horses, wear bandana, wrap blanket, "roadtrip in wild west" (as the art show). They play cards in inns, provoke gun fights and win, occasionally deliberately act like bandits and rob gold mine owners, distribute gold to other poorer people, gets a fame of western Robin Hood and best gunner for themselves.

### Act 4

> **Outline:** Cas is too wounded to fly again and can't risk using his power in case he gets noticed by Raphael (still scouting in time flux), so he lives in the town like a human, also tries his best to blend in. After a while when he recovers slightly, he asks around if anyone has seen the brothers based on his description but no one does. The town looks relatively new, not so crappy, he asks time and realizes why. To stay in the town for longer and not raise suspicion, Cas starts working in a ranch just to continue pretending to be a normal human. Cas is still weak and low in power, but as time goes by, he's growing back.

### Act 5

> **Outline:** Dean & Sam go back to Sunrise Wyoming, get jump attacked by a stranger, very obviously trying to kill them and very good at fighting, and after a few rounds they realize he's not human. It's Castiel, the original 1860s timeline version, receives order that they're disturbing the timeline and comes to eliminate them (Castiel: "You pray too loud. I really don't know why you act like we are familiar" Dean: "I almost forget how big of an asshole you were before"). Dean almost gets killed, prays desperately instinctively again to his Cas, and gets saved when this Castiel gets blown away by power. His Cas is there, cowboy looking, dirty from ranch work, totally blend in and human-like, faceful of "I finally found you".
>
> Dean: "Where have you been?" Cas: "When." Dean: "Wh-- how long have you been here?" Cas: "Twenty years. I landed too early, so I have to wait for you to catch up, wait for time to pass in the slow old way." Dean: "I prayed to you." Cas: "I know." He can hear all the time but can't get to Dean.
>
> Cas flies them home, back to the same day they leave for the phoenix's ashes. Bobby is still there, exactly the same as before, everything the same. (Or not exactly, Dean's western fame gets kept in history, legends of himself becomes a cowboy story, exaggerated but he's amused)
