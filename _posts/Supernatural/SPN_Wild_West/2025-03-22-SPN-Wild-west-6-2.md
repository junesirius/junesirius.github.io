More than ever, Cas misses the human invention of phones. He doesn't like many of the things they call advanced techniques of the last century, but the existence of a phone does make one's life so much easier.

Especially when it comes to finding people hidden from all the angels.

Cas would follow the tracks to where the horse marks disappear into water or bushes, and search the land for hours after hours with no outcome.

Then Dean's prayer would come through, echoing in his brain like a one-directional phone line where he can only listen but has no way to answer.

He misses the times when he could simply dial his number and ask, "Dean, where are you?"

Even though, Dean doesn't always seem pleased to see him drop by. He complains a lot, especially if it's during his sleep time. But Cas decides, it's just how the human is, and he misses that too.

<br>

He loses Dean's track somewhere near the state line between Utah and Arizona. No new bank reported to have been robbed for a while around the area, Cas goes back to the last town he knows Dean has visited -- Pinecrest, Utah.

A wanted poster with a sketch of Dean's profile is newly attached outside the bank's door, under the name of "Clint Eastwood."

Cas stands there staring at the image. The sketch isn't accurate, the stubbles and freckles are wrong, but the eyes are vivid. He looks into the eyes, having a weird feeling that the eyes have their own lives and can see through him, knowing all the dirty little secrets that are eating him up.

Cas shifts uneasily, but he can't take his eyes away. His gaze follows the jawline of his figure, and the shape of his nose, before landing back onto the eyes that are black and white in the image. He thinks about the emerald color of his eyes.

One of the bank guards walks out, asking if he has seen the man.

Cas blinks once, and says no.

"He's actually charming as an outlaw," the guard recalls. "Very polite." He shows Cas his wrist, where there are no marks. "See? They didn't even tie me up."

Cas can't hold back a small smile, and tells the guard, "I've heard they are good men."

The guard nods once, and moves back to the bank.

Cas tears down the poster when no one is looking, and takes it with him.

<br>

He learns to check the newspapers to find new updates about "Clint Eastwood" and his gang.

Though after a while, he realizes they are always either outdated or fake.

A bank is reported to be robbed in Rattlesnake Bend, Nevada. Cas rides into the town, but the town is safe and sound from any robbery for over a month.

He doubts Dean would ever kill anyone if they're not monsters, but when the newspaper says Clint Eastwood has shown up in Cattle Creek, Kansas with a body count, he still goes there to check it out, just in case.

It is near the end of summer, Kansas is still hot and dry. People in the town wear ridiculously large cowboy hats to shield themselves from the sun. The saloon is called Skinny's Saloon. The man behind the bar counter is exactly as the name suggests.

Cas approaches him to ask if a cowboy with his height and green eyes has ever visited. Skinny raises a pistol at him as soon as he hears the question.

Cas tilts his head at the man's reaction, wondering what it is that he's done wrong.

"Who are you?" Skinny demands, "His friend or enemy?" He holds the pistol in the right hand, the left hand hanging limp and shaky by his side, that side of his shoulder twitching uncontrollably.

Cas considers, and he says, "Nobody. I just want to find him." At the man's doubtful gaze, Cas manages to add, "He is wanted, isn't he? There are posters about him."

Skinny lowers his gun and huffs a laugh, "Ah, bounty hunter."

Cas nods at that, "So? Is he here or not?"

Skinny says, with much disappointment. "He's not. I'd hoped he'd come visit once he saw the paper, but he never did. Only dumbasses like you popping up."

"You want to trick him here? Why?" Cas squints. This man is not a demon, but who says demons have to come from hell.

Skinny points at his wounded left shoulder. "Thunderhill, Colorado. That bastard put a bullet in here." He grinds his teeth. "Ever heard about a cowboy's revenge? This ain't over until he's dead."

"You're going to kill him?" Cas tenses.

"Sure I do." Skinny smirks. "If no one else does it before me."

Cas stands up, leaning on the counter, speaking one word at a time, dead serious. "I can't let you do that."

"What, because you want all the bounty to yourself? Go ahead, kill him first then." Skinny glances at him carelessly. "Or do you want to settle it the old way?"

Cas wants to ask what old way, but glancing down, he sees the man has already picked up the pistol again, pointing it in his direction. He gets it easily.

"Old way, then," Cas says grimly.

They take the fight outside.

Noon, main street. There are people watching.

Cas had his gun belt back when he was three states away, because he realized people tend to ask more questions if he doesn't have one.

His fingers hover at the edge of the gun, his eyes locked straight on the skinny cowboy's. The cowboy is sweating heavily.

For a second, Cas feels bad for him, but the next second, he remembers his venomous tone of hatred when he said, "Sure I do," about killing Dean.

Cas's eyes turn cool as ice. He draws the gun and shoots the man in the chest. The man barely has a chance to draw his gun and already falls to the ground, dead.

Cas puts the gun back to the holster. Not liking the way the crowd looks at him, as if he's some kind of hero. He just killed a man, he thinks bitterly, though he has no choice.

He leaves Kansas quickly.

The gun is pressed against his thigh, still feeling hot. Cas wonders if Dean will have to kill any man during these western times.
