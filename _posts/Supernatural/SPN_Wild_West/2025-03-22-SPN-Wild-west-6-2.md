More than ever, Cas misses the human invention of phones. He doesn't like many of the things they call advanced techniques in the last century, but the existence of phone does make one's life so much easier.

Especially when it comes to the people that are hidden from all angels.

Cas would follow the track to where the horse marks disappear into water or bushes, and search the land for hours after hours with no outcome.

Then Dean's prayer would come through, echoing in his brain like a one-direction phone line where he can only listen but no way to answer.

He misses the times when he can just dial his number and ask "Dean, where are you".

Even though, Dean doesn't always seem pleased to see him dropping by. He complains a lot, especially if it's during his sleep time. But Cas decides, it's just how humans are, and he misses that too.

<br>

He loses Dean's track somewhere near the state line between Utah and Arizona. No new bank get robbed for a while around the area, Cas goes back to the last town he knows Dean has visited -- Pinecrest, Utah.

A wanted poster with a sketch of Dean's profile is newly attached outside of the bank's door, under the name of Clint Eastwood.

Cas stands there staring at the image. The sketch isn't accurate, the stubbles and freckles are wrong, but the eyes are vivid. He looks into the eyes, having a weird feeling that the eyes have their own lives and can see through him knowing all the dirty little secrets that are eating him up.

Cas shifts uneasily, but he can't take his eyes away. His look follows the jawline of his figure, and the shape of his nose, landing back to the eyes that are black and white on the image. He thinks about the emerald color of his eyes.

One of the guards of the bank walks out asking if he has seen the man.

Cas blinks once, and says no.

"He's actually charming as an outlaw," the guard recalls, "very polite." He shows him his wrist, where there is nothing to see. "See? They didn't even tie me up."

Cas can't hold back a small smile, and tells the guard, "I heard they are good men."

The guard nods once, and moves back to the bank.

Cas tears down the poster when no one sees, and takes it with him.

<br>

He learns to check the newspapers to find new updates of "Clint Eastwood" and his gangs.

Though after a while he realizes it is always either outdated or fake.

A bank is reported to be robbed in Rattlesnake Bend, Nevada. Cas rides into the town, but the town is safe and sound from any robbery for over a month now.

He doubts Dean would ever kill anyone if they're not monsters, but when the newspaper says Clint Eastwood has shown up in Cattle Creek, Kansas with a headcount, he still goes there to check it out, just in case.

It is near the end of the summer, Kansas is still hot and dry. People in the town wears ridiculously large cowboy hat to cover the sun. The saloon is called Skinny's Saloon. The man behind the bar counter is exactly as the name suggests.

Cas approaches him to ask if there is a cowboy of his height and green eyes ever visited. Skinny raises a pistol at him as soon as he hears the question.

Cas tilts his head at the man's reaction, wondering what is it that he got wrong.

"Who are you?" Skinny demands, "His friend or enemy?" He holds the pistol in the right hand, the left hand falling limp and shaky by his side, that side of shoulder twitching uncontrollably.

Cas considers, and he says, "Nobody. I just want to find him." At the man's doubtful eyes, Cas manages to add, "He is wanted, isn't it? There are posters about him."

Skinny lowers his gun and huffs a laughter, "Ah, bounty hunter."

Cas nods at that, "So? Is he here or not?"

Skinny says, with much disappointment. "He's not. I'd hope he'd come visit once he sees the paper, but he never does."

"You want to trick him here? Why?" Cas squints. This man is not a demon, but who says demons have to come from hell.

Skinny points at his wounded left shoulder. "Thunderhill, Colorado. That bastard puts a bullet in here." He grinds the teeth. "Ever heard about cowboy's revenge? This ain't over until he's dead."

"You're going to kill him?" Cas tenses.

"Sure I do." Skinny smirks, "If no one else did it before me."

Cas stands up, leaning on the counter, speaking one word at a time, dead serious. "I can't let you do that."

"What, because you want all the bounty to yourself? Go ahead kill him first then." Skinny looks at him carelessly. "Or do you want to settle it the old way?"

Cas wants to ask what old way, but glancing down, he sees the man already picks up the pistol again, pointing in his direction. He gets it easily.

"Old way, then." He says gloomily.

They take the fight outside.

Noon time, main street. There are people watching.

Cas had his gun belt back when he's three states before, because he realized people tend to ask more questions if he doesn't have one.

His fingers hover at the outskirt of the gun, his eyes looking straight at the eyes of the skinny cowboy. The cowboy is sweating heavily.

For a second, Cas feels bad for him, but the next second, he remembers his tone of hatred when he said "Sure I do" about killing Dean.

Cas's eyes cool to icy. He draws the gun and shoots the man in the chest. The man barely has chance to take his gun out and already fall to the ground dead.

Cas puts the gun back to the holster. Not liking the way the crowd looks at him, as if he's some kind of hero. He just killed a man, he thinks bitterly, though he has to.

He leaves Kansas quickly.

The gun is pressed to his thigh, still feeling hot. Cas wonders if Dean would have to kill any man during this western times.
