Eyes unblinking, gun raised, not for a split second does Dean think he might be too slow. Then the sound of the gunshot echoes, the phoenix burns with bright golden light, and turns into a pile of ashes.

He still gets this. Dean beams to himself.

The clock bells the tone of high noon, the sound shaking him out of the mist of contentment.

"Dean! The ashes!" Sam yells behind him, following by several steps.

Dean dashes to the ashes, glass bottle ready in head, tip opened. The ashes fill into the bottle before the minute ends.

He lets out a breath, regarding the glassful of ashes, shaking the bottle slightly, checking it out in content before closing the lid. Right on time. Mission complete.

The minute passes. No stir in the air.

Dean glances back at Sam, both frowning.

The hands on the wall clock are ticking.

"Where's Cas?" Sam voices the question on his mind, hesitant, uneasy.

Dean gives him a tight smile, checking the clock again. Five minutes have passed. "Dude might be busy," he says weakly. "Give him another minute."

Castiel does not show up in the next minute, or the next five. Or ten.

Dean starts pacing, looking at the sky, half praying, half just speaking to the empty air in front of him. "Hey Cas? Forget to check the watch or something? Time to pick us up."

He looks around. The town is still the western town they spent the last twenty four hours in: Sunrise, Wyoming. Not Bobby's place, definitely not Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Something is not right.

"Dean," Sam says slowly, pointing out the obvious. "Cas is never late for anything."

"He has wings. He can literally fly to any time anywhere, 'cause he'd never be late for anything," Dean says, staring at the clock with even more attention than he had with the phoenix during the duel, as if the solution is somehow hanging on the tip of one metal clock hand.

"Then why do you think...?" Sam doesn't have to finish his sentence.

"I don't know." Dean forces out a breath, pushing down the unease in his gut. "Let's just wait inside. Maybe he'll come just in a bit."

<br>

They sit by the sticky bar table in the Saloon. Elkins pours them each a glass of beer -- still tasting like horse piss, but Dean manages to let it slide down his throat. If he has to stay here longer, might as well start getting used to it.

"You boys alright?" Elkins eyes them while cleaning a glass with a piece of brown yellow rag god knows has been used for how long.

Dean swallows the liquid. "Yeah, yeah," he says, forcing a smile. "Just waiting for a friend to come by."

"Someone late for the date night?" the bartender reads his face, half joking.

"You can say that." Dean's too lazy to retort.

<br>

The saloon has some bar food too, they use it for dinner.

The night soon falls on them. There is still no sign of Cas.

"You want to, umm," Sam shifts on the stool next to him, "-- get a room for the night?" He nods at the wooden "Room" sign hanging under the saloon's signboard.

Dean checks his watch. It's been ten hours.

He empties the glass and stands up. "Yeah ok, let's go." Then adds, "But not here."

"What's wrong with here?"

Dean's eyes sweep through the saloon girls gathering and giggling around the base of the staircase, the sounds of cheap beds shaking are remotely audible from upstairs. His gaze lands back on Sam, raising his eyebrows that can speak by themselves: *Serious?*

Sam hums. "Good point."

They go back to the sheriff's office. With both the sheriff and the deputy down, that place is just a whole big empty room waiting to be claimed.

Dean leads them back inside. The deputy's charred skeleton is still behind the bar, the air still smelling of burnt flesh. Dean decides not to think about that for now. He wanders around the place, looking for anything available to claim for their use.

"You seem to fit the place well enough," Sam observes.

Dean gives him a look, fingering the sheriff's pin on his shirt. "You kidding me? I'm officially the sheriff in town, so yeah, this is legitimately my place now, 'course I fit in here."

"Not just in here," Sam waves his hands, gesturing vaguely. "Everything -- the shirt, the duel, the horse. People might actually buy that you're from this time, which, of course, is a good thing."

Slow understanding starts to kick in. Dean looks up from the lost-and-found bucket he's been scrounging through, squinting at him, "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying," Sam pauses, meeting his eyes, considering the words carefully, "we might have to stay here for quite some time, might as well blend in."

"No, no," Dean straightens up. "Cas is going to be here shortly. Maybe not tonight-short, but tomorrow or something. He -- he won't keep us waiting for too long."

If he says it with enough confidence, he can convince himself too, right?

"Then how long?" Sam pulls a mocking smile. "You don't even believe it yourself."

Dean breaks the gaze, impatient. "So what? You think Cas's just gonna dump us in here? In the middle of the wild, right on the edge of the Civil War?"

"Thought you'd like that," Sam says, easing around, grabbing a chair to sit down. "Isn't it your dream life? Since like six?"

"What? No!" Sam raises an eyebrow. Dean is muted for a second, frowning at him. "Yeah? I mean -- not like this!"

He trails off, giving their surroundings a closer look. The bars, the officer's wooden desk, a couple of lousy chairs, the walls with peeling paper, some random jacket and whip or something scattered around, rifles and shotguns standing in the corner. The air smells of dust and horse.

"Not like this." He lands on it, going back to check the drawers under the desk. "Cas will come, I assure you. Just give him a bit of time. He'll come. He always does."

"What if he can't? What if something happened to him, and he's... he's too weak to time travel, or even dead?"

"Don't say that!" Dean snaps, jerking his head up from behind the desk, glaring at his brother. "Nothing's gonna happen to him, alright? Dude gets his full power back, new and improved, and he's leading a full army Upstairs! Must be just in the middle of war-prep meeting or something." He glances at the ceiling reflexively, as if he could see Heaven like that.

"I'm just being realistic," Sam defends in a calm but worried voice. "Why else would he be late? We both know he's in a war and Raphael is on his tail. And we have no idea how bad things are with his war, I mean, not really. That lieutenant angel, Rachel or something? Said they're in a serious situation, didn't she? Balthazar said something similar before, some bad position. We didn't even ask how bad."

"Cas is fine." That's all Dean can think to say. He swallows, closing his eyes for a second then reopening them. He doesn't know that, but that's the only thing he can say. The only thing he has to hold on to. "He survived so many apocalypses before, surely Raphael can't be worse than Lucifer, right?"

He doesn't mean to bring up the Lucifer thing, that time no more than a year ago when Cas was face to face with *both* Michael and Lucifer, right before he got exploded by the Devil. Dean flinches at the memory. The power of an archangel has always been just an expression in his mind that he doesn't give much thought to, but what if...

He shakes his head, dragging himself away from that train of thought. "We don't know anything, so let's not freak ourselves out just thinking about the worst, eh? Now, move your ass over here and help me see if there's some blanket or something around for the night."

<br>

"You boys still hanging around?" Elkins gives them a nod while serving some other town folks the next day. "Thought you'd have moved on by now."

"Believe me, we want to, but eh.. still waiting for the ride." Dean gives him one of those convincing smiles he has perfected over the years with case victims and authorities.

"There are a few spare horses around here if it's a ride you want," the bartender offers, being as kindly as any old Western man can be.

"Uh, we actually..." Sam starts.

"You know what, that would be awesome," Dean cuts him off, smiling brightly at the old man.

They use the gold they brought along to pay off the food and drink before heading out. Didn't get any suspicious looks.

"I'd give this one to Bobby," Dean murmurs under his breath as they walk out of the saloon. "Era of no plastic but all gold, I wouldn't know what to do if we didn't have those."

The bag of gold is still heavy on his shoulder. The weight of wealth and reassurance.

Sam scoffs. "No credit card fraud or pooling this time."

Dean looks back over his shoulder, eyes sprinkling with cunning joy. "Ha, but there's still poker. You never know what skill could come in handy or even save our ass some time a hundred fifty years in the past, do you, Sammy?"

Sam shakes his head, laughing.

<br>

The horses Elkins pointed them to belong to the late Judge and old Sheriff. One is a beautiful black horse with fur so bright and smooth it almost reminds Dean of the Impala.

"Hey baby," he strokes her back, voice gentle, love flowing from his eyes. "You miss me?"

"Dean, I don't think she'd ever known you," Sam snorts.

Dean gives him a stern look. "You don't know that." He shifts the attention back to the beauty, its muscles strong and warm under his palm. "We might have met in our previous lives or something. Tell me she's not exactly like Baby to you?"

Sam tilts his head, regarding the horse, the tip of his lips curling. "Hmm." he has to agree.

The other tan-brown horse with a white stripe on its nose decides to throw a temper tantrum at Sam for a few moments when he approaches, but eventually lets him tie the saddle and pats its back.

<br>

They don't really have anywhere in mind to go, with the horses. But they are still overdelighted to have them. Dean, especially.

Days later, when he's grooming the Baby -- of course he has to name her after the real Baby -- Sam tells him, chuckling, "You have any idea how much it's like watching you wash the car?"

Dean doesn't look back from his busy work by hand, "I don't know, Sam, just the me in another life, I guess."

Sam's chuckle fades. The silence makes Dean glance back warily.

"What?" he asks, slowing down the handwork.

"I didn't even realize how settled in we already are, like we're *actually* already in another life." Sam frowns. "Almost forgot to count how many days it's been, since..."

"Since March the fifth," Dean says for him. "Since the day the phoenix died and Cas was supposed to meet us. Yeah I remember. Kinda hard to forget, don't you think?"

The glass bottle of phoenix ash is still tucked under his jacket, just in case he has to be pulled away in a hurry, he'd make sure the reason why they're here in the first place wouldn't get lost.

Sam swallows, giving Dean a quick glance, a little sheepishly. "So is it time we finally start talking?"

"About what?"

"About what to do if Cas never comes, if he just can't, and we might have to figure out our own way back?"

Dean stares at him, face grim, brows knitted tight. Eventually he sighs, giving in to the stare, licking his lips. "Ok, yeah, you might be right. Can't put all the burden on the man, he might even need our help back home."
