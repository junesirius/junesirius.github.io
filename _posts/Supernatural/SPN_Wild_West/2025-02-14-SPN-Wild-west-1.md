Eyes unblinking, gun raised, not for a split second Dean thinks he might be too slow. Then the gunshot sound echoes, the phoenix burns with bright golden light and turns into a pile of ashes.

He still gets this. Dean beams to himself.

The clock bells the tone of high noon. Sound shaking him out of the mist of contentment.

"Dean! The ashes!" Sam yells behind him, following by several steps.

Dean dashes to the ashes, glass bottle ready in head, tip opened. The ashes fill into the bottle before the minute ends.

He lets out a breathe, regarding the glassful of ashes, shaking the bottle slightly, closes the lid. Right on time. Mission complete.

The minute passes. No stir in the air.

Dean glances back at Sam, both frowning.

The hands on the wall clock are ticking.

"Where's Cas?" Sam voices the question in his mind, hesitant, uneasy.

Dean gives him a tight smile, checking the clock again. Five minutes passed. "Dude might be busy," he says. "Give him another minute."

Castiel does not show up in the next minute, or the next five. Or ten.

Dean starts pacing, looking at the sky, half praying half just speaking to the empty air in front of him. "Hey Cas? Forget to check the watch or something? Time to pick us up."

He looks around. The town is still the western town they spent the last twenty four hours in, Sunrise, Wyoming. Not Bobby's place, definitely not Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Something is not right.

"Dean," Sam says slowly, pointing out the obvious. "Cas's never late for anything."

"He has wings, he can literally fly to any time anywhere, 'cause he'd never be late for anything." Dean says, staring at the clock with even more attention than he had with the phoenix during the duel, as if the solution is somehow hanging on the tip of one metal clock finger.

"Then why do you think...?" Sam doesn't have to finish his sentence.

"I don't know." Dean forces out a breath, pushing down the unease in his gut. "Let's just wait inside. Maybe he'll come just in a bit."

<br>

They sit by the sticky bar table in the Saloon. Elkins pours them each a glass of beer -- still tasting like horse piss but Dean manages to let it slide down the throat. If he has to stay here longer, might as well start getting used to it.

"You boys alright?" Elkins eyes them while cleaning a glass with a piece of brown yellow clothes god knows has been used for how long.

Dean swallows the liquid. "Yeah, yeah," he says, forcing a smile. "Just waiting for a friend to come by."

"Someone late for the date night?" the bartender reads his face, half joking.

"You can say that." Dean's too lazy to retort.

<br>

The saloon has some bar food too, they use them as the dinner.

The night soon falls on them. There is still no sign of Cas.

"You want to, umm," Sam shifts in the stool next to him, "-- get a room for the night?" He nods toward the wooden "Room" sign below the saloon's signboard.

Dean checks his watch. It's been ten hours.

He empties the glass and stands up. "Yeah ok, let's go." Then adds, "But not here."

"What's wrong with here?"

Dean's eyes sweep through the saloon girls gathering and giggling around the base of the staircase, sounds of cheap bed shaking are remotely audible. His eyes land back on Sam's, raising the eyebrows that can speak by themselves: *Serious?*

Sam hums. "Good point."

They go back to the sheriff's office. With both the sheriff and the deputy down, that place is just a whole big empty room waiting to be claimed.

Dean leads them back in there. The deputy's charred skeleton is still behind the bar, the air burnt flesh. Dean decides to not think about that for now. He wanders around the place, looking for anything available to claim for their use.

"You seem to fit the place well enough." Sam observes.

Dean gives him a look, fingering the sheriff's pin on his shirt. "You kidding me? I'm officially the sheriff in town, so yeah, this is legitimately my place now, 'course I fit in here."

"Not just in here," Sam supplements. "Everything, the shirt, the duel, the horse. People might actually buy in that you're from this time, which, of course, is a good thing."

Slow understanding starts kicking in. Dean looks up from the lost-and-found bucket he's been scrounge, squinting, "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying," Sam pauses, looking him in the eyes, considering the words carefully. "We might have to stay here for quite some time, might as well blend in."

"No, no," Dean straightens up. "Cas is going to be here shortly. Maybe not tonight short, but tomorrow or something. He -- he won't keep us waiting for too long."

If he says it with enough confidence, he can convince himself too, isn't it?

"Then how long?" Sam pulls a mocking smile. "You don't even believe it yourself."

Dean breaks the gaze, impatient. "So what? You think Cas's gonna just dump us in here? In the middle of the wild, right on the edge of the Civil War?"

"Thought you'd like that," Sam says, easing around, grabbing a chair to sit down. "Isn't it your dream life? Since like six?"

Dean is muted for a second, frowning at him. "What? No! Yeah? I mean -- not like this!"

He trails off, giving their surrounding a quick look around. The bars, the officer's wooden desk, a couple lousy chairs, the walls with peeling paper, some random jacket and whip or something scattering around. The air smells dust and horse.

"Not like this." He lands on it, going back to check the drawers under the desk. "Cas will come, I assure you. Just give him a bit time. He'll come. He always do."

"What if he can't? What if something happened to him, and he's... he's too weak to time travel, or even dead?"

"Don't say that!" Dean snaps, jerking his head up from behind the desk, glaring at his brother. "Nothing's gonna happen to him, alright? Dude gets his full power back, new and improved, and he's leading a full army Upstairs! Must be just in the middle of war prepping meeting or something." He glances at the ceiling reflexively, as if he can see the Heaven like that.

"I'm just being realistic," Sam says in a calm but worried voice. "Why else would he be late? We both know he's in a war and Raphael is on his tail. And we have no idea how bad the things are with his war, I mean, not really. That lieutenant angel, Rachel or something? Says they're in a bad position, isn't it? Balthazar said something similar before. We didn't even ask how bad."

"Cas is fine." That's all Dean can think of to say. He swallows, closing the eyes for a second and reopening. He doesn't know that, but that's the only thing he can say. Only thing he has to hold on to. "He survives so many apocalypses before, surely Raphael can't be worse than Lucifer, right?"

He doesn't mean to bring up the Lucifer thing, that time no more than a year ago when Cas was face to face with *both* Michael and Lucifer, right before he got exploded by the Devil. He flinches, the power of archangel has always been just an expression in his mind that he doesn't give much thought to, but what if...

He shakes his head, dragging himself away from that train of thought. "We don't know anything, so let's not freak ourselves out just by thinking about the worst, eh? Now, move your ass over here and help me find if there's some blanket or something around for the night."

<br>

"You boys still hanging around?" Elkins gives them a nod while serving some other town folks the next day. "Thought you'd move on by now."

"Believe me, we want to, but eh.. still waiting for the ride." Dean gives him one of those convincing smiles he has perfected over the years with the case victims and authorities.

"There are a few spare horses around here if it's a ride you want." The bartender offers, being as kindly as any old western man can be.

"Uh, we actually..." Sam starts.

"You know what, that would be awesome." Dean cuts him off, smiling brightly at the old man.

They use the gold they bring along to pay off the food and drink before heading out. Didn't get any suspicious look.

"I'd give this one to Bobby." Dean murmurs under breath when they walk out of the saloon. "Era of no plastic but all gold, I wouldn't know what to do if we don't have those."

The bag of gold is still heavy on his shoulder. The weight of wealth and reassurance.

Sam scoffs. "No credit card fraud or pooling this time."

Dean looks back over his shoulder, eyes sprinkling with cunning joy. "Ha, but there's still poker. You never know what skill could come handy or even save our ass some time a hundred fifty years in the past, don't you, Sammy?"

Sam shakes his head, laughing.

<br>

The horses Elkins pointed to them belong to the late Judge and old Sheriff. One beautiful black horse with furs so bright and smooth it almost reminds him of the Impala.

"Hey baby," Dean strokes its back, voice gentle, love flowing from his eyes, "you miss me?"

"Dean, I don't think she'd ever known you." Sam snorts.

Dean gives him a stern look, "You don't know that." He shifts the attention back to the beauty, its muscle strong and warm under his palm. "We might have met in our previous lives or something. Tell me she's not exactly like Baby to you?"

Sam tilts his head, regarding the horse, tip of his lips curls. "Hmm." he has to agree.

The other tan brown horse with a white stripe on the nose decides to throw its temper at Sam for a few moments when he approaches, but eventually lets him tie the saddle and pats on the back.

<br>

They don't really have anywhere in mind to go, with the horses. But they are still over delighted to have them. Dean, especially.

Days later, when he's grooming the Baby -- of course he has to name her after the real Baby -- Sam tells him, chuckling, "You have any idea how much it's like watching you wash the car?"

Dean doesn't look back from his busy work by hand, "I don't know, Sam, just the me in the other life, I guess."

Sam's chuckle stops. The silence makes Dean glance back.

"What?" he asks, slowing down the handwork.

"I didn't even realize how settled in we already are, like we're *actually* already in another life." Sam frowns. "Almost forget to count how many days it's been, since..."

"Since March the fifth," Dean says for him. "Since the day the phoenix died and Cas was supposed to meet us up, yeah I remember. Kinda hard to forget, don't you think?"

The glass bottle of phoenix ash is still tucked under his jacket, just in case if he has to be pulled away in a hurry, he'd make sure the reason why they're here in the first place wouldn't get lost.

Sam swallows, giving Dean a quick glance, a little sheepishly, "So is it time we finally start talking?"

"About what?"

"About what to do if Cas never come, if he just can't, and we might have to figure out our own way back?"

Dean stares at him, face grim, brows knitted tight. Eventually he sighs, giving in the stare, licking his lips. "Ok, yeah, you might be right. Can't put all the burden on the man, he might even need our help back home."
