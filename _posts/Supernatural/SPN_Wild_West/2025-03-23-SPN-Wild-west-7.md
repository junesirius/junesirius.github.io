The sound of his last question dangles in the air, floating there for a few extended seconds, before falling gradually to the ground like a flying feather drifting down.

*What happened, Cas?* Dean's eyes meet his, can't help wondering how many things these eyes have seen in the last twenty years -- how many beautiful things, and how many ugly things.

Cas is quiet. Too quiet. With the eyes too deep and blue, swirling like ocean water.

*Tell me, please.* Dean thinks hard, seeing Cas's eyes widen slightly, realizing the thought must have been conveyed through the prayer accidentally.

"It's... not easy," Cas murmurs, his voice husky and reluctant. "But it's gone now, so it doesn't matter." His eyes flicker to the outside of the door. Some outlines of dead and wounded men can be seen from where they stand. The moonlight is bright tonight.

"No, it matters," Dean tells him, his voice adamant. "It matters to me."

It's a long tale. From the day they left Bobby's place until now. It almost feels like a lifetime ago. That life where they fought another apocalypse and asshole demons and archangels, feels like a long dream that is slowly fading in the memory while this one, the wild lands, the gang Dean befriended over months, the ranch Cas worked in for years, this feels so real now.

Cas finishes his story, and Dean finishes telling his. They let the aftertaste linger, stretching on the tip of the tongue.

"It's a difficult life," Dean says slowly.

Cas nods quietly.

They are sitting by the sheriff's desk now, pulling the two chairs close, their knees touching. Dean's fingers absent-mindedly fumble with the new sheriff's pin on the desk -- whoever it belongs to now.

"But also a simple one," Dean adds, remembering the vast landscape in front of him, infinite. The edge of the ocean can't be seen from there. On horseback, on this land, he is free.

"The life on the ranch is also simple," Cas admits. "Quiet. Too quiet you might find it boring. That's probably why old Ludlow's second son has to go into the woods looking for bears to fight."

Dean chuckles. "Sounds like someone I'd like to meet."

Cas smiles with him. "Yes, I think you'll like him. You'll like all of them."

Silence falls between them again. Calm and comfortable. They just sit there, with only moonlight filtering through broken windows and the door.

They're not eager to go anywhere, or any time. They've spent too long getting to this point, at least they've earned a moment to catch their breath.

Dean's mind wanders to the ranch in Cas's words. He doesn't need to see the place to know it must be something Cas would enjoy. The livestock and the wildlife, the creatures and the woods. The growing kids, girls and boys growing to become fine ladies and gentlemen -- or wild girls and uncivilized hunters, if they choose to.

They could live there, own a small hut of their own, take possession of a small corner of the ranch. They could tend to the land and watch the sunset from the porch. The air would smell like wood and grass, their hands weathered from farm work instead of gunfire. Dean blinks hard, thinking, *that doesn't even sound half bad*. Sam is welcome to stay, or find another ranch of his own with someone he enjoys spending time with. They could just live normal, quiet lives, and probably die of boredom, old age, or too much healthy natural food, sometime around the turn of the twentieth century. Dean finds himself not mind that they would not even live to the day that the Impala is produced or the day Led Zeppelin starts their touring. With Cas, and Sam, safe and happy with him, there isn't much else to ask for. Dean smiles.

"What are you thinking?" Cas breaks the silence.

"I might miss this place," Dean tells him.

"We don't have to go," Cas offers, genuinely.

"I know." But Dean already starts standing up from the seat, holding out a hand to pull Cas to his feet too.

He reaches for the glass of phoenix ash that has been tucked inside his inner pocket. Shaking it to show the contents, making his point clear. "We came here for this, and we got it. The world back home still needs saving. Don't want to keep Bobby waiting for too long, do we?"

Cas nods, then chews his tongue. Dean watches him. Cas sighs deeply. "There is something I should have let you know a long time ago. I've had twenty years to think it over, and time does have the magic to clear one's mind."

The wild land of the West is plain and straightforward, so it is how it makes them. No more lies, no more secrets. No more hide and seek, no more chase and run.

Cas confesses -- the deal with the demon, the war with the archangel, the messy things among angels, the friends and enemies, all the concerns and worries, all the things he thought he could contain in his head -- They flood out under the moonlight in the Wild West, in front of Dean's eyes.

The wind and sand hear them. The night is long and quiet.

Cas breathes out, waiting for a furious blow. Only to find Dean's look intense, but not angry.

"We'll figure this out, together. Later." Dean says. Then, "Now let's pick up Sam and go home."

<br>

They find Sam at Samuel's place, as expected. The two of them are adding extra sigils to the hut. They argue a lot, just like all the familiar bickering with Bobby. The squabbles are sour and bitter, but funny in their own way. Their heads lean close over a sigil on one of the books, immediately starting to argue about the correct interpretation. They paint the symbol together, trying some ritual and magical experiments, unsurprised to see them not working. Then they move on to test the next theory. The bottle of whiskey on Samuel's writing desk is emptied, there are two glasses there.

Sam hates to leave as much as back when he was still in school and Dean or their Dad had to tell him they were moving again.

Sam pouts his lips in protest, patting Samuel on the shoulder at their farewell.

The old legendary hunter pats him back on the same spot. Not saying anything, but standing by the hut's door, waving.

Dean almost feels bad for him.

<br>

They are back at Bobby's place in the blink of an eye. Landing on the date of April the twenty fifth, 2011, precisely. Minutes after Cas woke up from Bobby's couch and flew away from the place.

"So the time dimension this round, it's easy to fly?" Dean murmurs low, low enough for only Cas to hear, as their feet touch the ground again.

"Yes." Cas nods slightly by his side, steadying his stumbling footsteps from the landing.

Dean squints at him, checking him over. There is a fresh new tear on the back of his trench coat, but no sign of blood or wound.

Dean raises an eyebrow at the tear while Sam strides over to hug and greet Bobby. Cas murmurs under his breath, "It is not of import. I'm fine, Dean, Raphael missed, I'm faster this time. We're safe, for now."

Dean is relieved slightly, turning to hug Bobby so tightly that the old hunter grumbles.

"Alright, alright, sappy," Bobby pats his back a few times. "No need to grow girl parts, it's just three days."

"Oh," Dean stills, remembering that's true for him.

Bobby looks exactly the same as before, as he should. So does this room, or the state, or the world. Except for them.

Bobby takes them in -- Dean has his long cowboy beard and wrinkles from dry wind and sand; Sam changes the least, only with longer and messier hair; and Cas, almost totally a new different being, in his overhuman-like ranch and cowboy clothing, and a weather-beaten look in his eyes. Bobby squints at them. "You better tell me everything."

So they do.

<br>

Then, the old life comes back. The old demon-hunting, monster-killing life that Dean's grown up with. They make plans, they hunt down Eve, they deal with Crowley, they handle Raphael. They work on saving the world every other Tuesday.

Sam jumps right back into the old routine as if the months in the Wild West never left a mark on his memory. But Dean thinks, in between the monster-hunting and world-saving, when he exchanges a glance with Cas, he knows something will never be the same ever again.

Sometimes at night, when he lies in a motel bed, staring at the ceiling, wide awake, he finds it easy to imagine the current life a dream, the memory a reality. They could all still be in the Wild West, and the whole world-saving thing is just one long dream to wake up from.

He might as well be lying in a saloon room in an old town, cowboys on horseback stomping noisily down the floor, the smell of animal dung mixed with saloon ladies' perfumes filling the air, music drifting through the thin wooden walls.

He could still feel the wind from the old western time blowing through his hair, the land vast, the world open to explore. Dean allows himself to imagine the life they never had: Cas on the ranch, busy and happy, wearing a cowboy hat. They sit in the corner of a saloon on Friday nights, listening to the town folks playing old-time music, dancing and singing, happy and peaceful. All the while Cas by his side. Dean breathes, feeling the air calm and easy, the smell of dust is the taste of raw nature and freedom.

A life they never had, but an option always open. That night, under the moonlight, in the quiet moment, when he looks Cas in the eyes, Dean knows the answer to an unasked question, would be yes. He knows.

*What if we just, stay. Here and now. Us.*

A life in the past, could be their future.

The one thing they really want, is the one thing they could have.

Dean breathes slowly and deeply, closing his eyes in the quiet night.

Maybe they will, *one day*. When all is done, maybe they will.

They will have a banjo, Cas will have a harp. The music will be beautiful, so will the dance. People will be laughing, they will be holding each other close, enjoying the moment. The comfortable wind of the Wild West flow gently by. They will hold each other's gaze, so close they could see their own reflections. Cas will look at him like there is nothing else in the world, the way he always did. Dean thinks his own eyes might just be the same.

They will be happy. Content. Home.

Dean decides, he wants nothing more.

He falls asleep with a peaceful smile.
