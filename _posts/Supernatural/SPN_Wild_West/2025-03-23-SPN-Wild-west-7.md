The sound of his last question dangles in the air, floating there for a few extended seconds, then falling gradually to the ground like an autumn leave falling from the tree.

*What happened, Cas?* Dean's eyes match his, can't help wondering how many things these eyes have seen in the last twenty years -- how many beautiful things, and how many ugly things.

Cas is quiet. Too quiet. With the eyes too deep and blue, swirling like ocean water.

*Tell me, please.* Dean thinks hard, seeing Cas's eyes widen slightly, realizing the thought must have been conveyed through the prayer.

"It's... not easy." Cas murmurs, voice husky and reluctant. "But it's gone now, so it doesn't matter." His eyes flicker to outside of the door. Some outlines of dead and wounded men can be seen from where they stand. Moon light is bright tonight.

"No, it matters." Dean tells him, voice adamant. "It matters to me."

It's a long telling. From the day they left Bobby's place till now. It almost feels like a life time ago. That life where they fight another apocalypse and asshole demons and archangels, feels like a long dream that is slowly fading in the memory while this one, the wild lands, the gang Dean befriended with for months, the ranch Cas worked in for years, this feels so real now.

Cas finishes his story, and Dean finishes telling him his. They let the aftertaste stretch on the tip of the tongue.

"It's a difficult life." Dean says slowly.

Cas nods quietly.

They are sitting by the sheriff's desk now, pulling the two chairs close, their knees touching. Dean's fingers absent-mindedly fumble with the sheriff's pin on the desk.

"But also a simple one." He says, remembering the vast landscape in front of him, infinite. The edge of the ocean can't be seen from there. On the horseback, on this land, he is free.

"The life in the ranch is also simple." Cas says. "Quiet. Too quiet you might find it boring. That's probably why old Ludlow's second son has to go into the woods looking for bears to fight."

Dean chuckles, "Sounds like someone I'd like to meet."

Cas smiles with him, "You'll like them."

Quietness fall between them again. Calm and comfortable. They just sit there, with only moonlight filtering through broken windows and the door.

They're not eager to go anywhere, or any time. They've spent too long to get to this point, at least earned a moment to take a breath.

Dean's mind wanders to the ranch in Cas's words. He doesn't need to see the place to know it must be something Cas would enjoy. The livestock and the wild lives, the creatures and the woods. The growing up kids, girls and boys growing to be become fine ladies and gentlemen -- or wild girls and uncivilized hunters, if they choose to.

They can live there, own a small hut of their own, take possession of a small corner of the ranch. They can attend to the ranch then watch sunset from the porch. The air would smell like wood and grass, their hands gnarled from farm work instead of gun shot. Dean blinks hard, thinking, *that doesn't even sound half bad*. Sam is welcome to stay, or find another ranch of his own with someone he enjoys to spend time with. They can just live normal, quiet lives, and probably die of boredom, or old age, or too much healthy natural food, some time around the corner of the twentieth century. He finds himself doesn't mind that they would not even live to the day that Impala is produced or the day Led Zeppelin starts their touring. With Cas, and Sam, safe and happy and with him, there isn't much else to ask for. Dean smiles.

"What are you thinking?" Cas breaks the silence.

"I might miss this place." Dean tells him.

"We don't have to go." Cas offers, genuinely.

"I know." But Dean already starts standing up from the seat, holding out a hand to pull Cas to his feet too.

He reaches for the glass of phoenix's ash that has been tucked inside his inner pocket. Shaking it to show the content, making his point clear. "We came here for this, and we got it. The world back home still needs saving. Don't want to keep Bobby waiting for too long, do we?"

Cas nods, then chews his tongue. Dean eyes him. Cas sighs deep, "There is something I should have let you know a long time ago. I have twenty years to think it over, and time does have the magic to clear one's mind."

The wild land of the west is plain and straightforward, so it is how it makes them. No more lies, no more secrets. No more hide and seek, no more chase and run.

Cas confesses, the deal with the demon, the war with the archangel, the messy things among angels, all the concerns and worries, all the things he thought he can contain in his head, they flood out under the moonlight in the wild west land, in front of Dean's eyes.

The wind and sand hear them, the night is long and quiet.

Cas breathes out, waiting for a furious blow. Only to find Dean's look intense, but not angry.

"We'll figure this out, together." He says. Then, "Now lets pick Sam up and go home."

<br>

So they did.

They find Sam in Samuel's place, the two adding extra sigils to the hut. Occasionally, they lean over a sigil on one of the books, then start arguing the correct interpretation. Then they move on to test the next theory.

Sam hates to leave as much as back when he was still at school and when Dean or their dad had to tell him they're moving again.

Sam purses his mouth as his protest, patting Samuel on the shoulder at the time of farewell.

The old legendary hunter pats him back on the same spot. Not saying anything, but standing by the hut's door, waving.

Dean almost feels bad for him.

They are back at Bobby's place in a blink. Land on the date of April the twenty fifth, 2011. Minutes after Cas woke up from Bobby's couch and flew away from the place.

"So the time dimension this round, it's easy to fly?" Dean murmurs low and only Cas can hear, as their feet touch the ground again.

"Yes." Cas nods by his side. "Raphael isn't there anymore."

Dean relieves, turning to hug Bobby so tight that makes the old hunter grumbles.

"Alright, alright, sappy," Bobby pats his back a few times, "I only haven't seen you for three days."

"Oh." Dean stills, remembering that's true for him.

Bobby looks exactly the same as before, as he should. So is this room, or the state, or the world. Except for them.

Bobby takes them in -- Dean has long, cowboy's beard and wrinkles from dry wind and sand; Sam changes the least, only with longer and messier hair; and Cas, almost totally a new different being, with his over human-like ranch and cowboy clothing, and the deep look on his face. Bobby squints at them, "You have to tell me everything."

So they do.

<br>

Then, when the old life catches up, they goes back to the fighting. All the nasty, ugly beings, they fight them all -- the mother of all, the archangel of apocalypse, the king of the hell.

And sometimes, when that life becomes too dark and unbearable, Dean closes his eyes, and thinks back. Remembering the time when the wind from the old western time blows his hair, when the land is vast and world is open to explore. He imagines that life they never have, Cas in the ranch, busy and happy, wearing a cowboy hat; he imagines them sitting at the corner of a saloon, listening to town folks playing the old time music, dancing and singing, happy and peaceful. All the time, Cas by his side. He breathes, feeling the air calm and easy, as if floating with the smell of horse and wood.

A life they never have, but that is always a choice. That night, in the moonlight, in the quiet moment, he knows the answer to an unasked question, would be yes. He knows.

A life in the past, can be their future.

And in the end, in the very, very end, when all is done, that is indeed, exactly, what he gets.

They have a banjo, Cas has a harp. The music is beautiful, so is the dance. They are happy, content. Home.

Dean decides, he wants nothing more.
