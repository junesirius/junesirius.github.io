"Get out of my house." Samuel Colt grumbles, without bothering lifting his head. His colt on the desk by his hand -- a normal one, not the special one he'd already given to them.

"I'm really sorry to bother you again," Sam steps gingerly ahead, Dean follows him a few steps behind. "I wouldn't bother you if it's not absolute urgent."

"Thought I already did my share of help." He eyes them. "Don't tell me the Colt didn't work on the creature you're hunting."

"No, it's not that." Dean chimes in, "It worked, but uh... it's something else we can use a little help there."

"What part of *I'm retired* failed you?"

*Jesus, Samuel is clearly not an easy one to work with.* Dean thinks quietly, eyebrow raised a few inches.

"Like I said, in our time, you're sort of a really big deal, the most famous hunter -- " Sam manages a tight smile, as friendly as he can pull.

"Heard you the first time."

"So we figure you'd be the best supernatural researcher around here too." Dean pulls an puffery grin with his best effort.

"Please, we are not asking you to hunt with us or anything," Sam continues. "Just need a little help in research."

<br>

It turns out their guess isn't too far off. Samuel has as big of a book collection as Bobby's or Campbell's, right downstairs in the place where a cellar should be, but with tons more additional traps and sigils painted on every inch of floor and walls.

Panic room *and* library, nice. *Classic.* Dean looks around, thinking how *fun* it must be to be able to spending all the time reading while hiding out here.

Sam nudges him, eyeing the rows of books. He nods back.

Research time.

<br>

"Don't you think if there's a way to pull it off here and now, someone would have done that already?" Dean puts a book down after god knows how many hours, wiping his face by his hands, giving his brain some break. "Then why didn't we ever run into people time-traveled from the past all the time?"

Sam doesn't move his eyes away from whatever he's scanning. "They don't know what we know." he deadpans.

*But they don't know much about this time thing, either.* Dean thinks. It's always just Cas swinging them around, or some other douchebag angels occasionally. Just popping in and out, not really much theory or science to learn about.

Should probably have asked a few more questions about how time flux thing works. He realizes belatedly. But after all, not everyone is as nerdy as Sam.

"I just remember Cas said once that time travel isn't easy but not impossible," Dean thinks hard, poking some corner of old memories, the time when he met mom and dad when they were younger than his age, the other time when they were trying to stop the yellow-eyed demon but still failed utterly, even the time when he got flipped to the messed-up five years into the zombie land future that turns out never would come. What did Cas tell him during those short talks?

"He said that time is fluid, it's not easy, but apparently the angels have no problem bending it once in a while."

Sam jerks his head up, eyes bright with understanding, "And he also told us this time before we left, that the further back he sent us, the harder it becomes to retrieve us, that's why he said we can't stay for more than twenty four hours, or we'd be lost to him."

"Which means we are totally lost to him by now and no way home without the wings." Dean says bitterly.

"No, Dean!" Sam jumps to his feet. "That might be the idea! This book here also said something similar, quite many are saying the same thing actually, I just didn't realize they might be literal, thought it's more metaphorical."

He slides the book over with some illustration that looks like a river with sand banks on its sides, "Imagine the time is like river or something, fluid, rapid turbulence flow of some kind, and each of us is like a floating leaf. Cas can bend the waterway so it becomes non-chronological, the downstream touches the upstream, that's how we land here. And folding some part off would be to fast-forward into the future. But if we stay here for too long, we are like the leaves washed away by the flow by too far, that's probably why he can't find us, because he doesn't know where we are in the time flux anymore."

Dean's brows knit into a knot. "So... If we make some noise, *splash!* Fish jump out of water, we can make ourselves stand out in this timeline river somehow, so he can find us."

"Like temporal beacons. It might work -- assuming Cas is still out there looking for us." Sam's voice gets quieter at the last clause.

"He's out there." Dean says reflexively. Sam doesn't look convinced.

Dean gives the river picture a second look-over, thinking it over again, a minor smile starts showing. "Sounds like a plan to me. What kind of noise are we talking about?"

Sam looks a little caught by the question, shrugging unsurely. "How would I know? Something big enough to get some notice in the future, I guess? I would definitely notice if your face show up in some old western posters, guess you can finally make a name for yourself in this era, like you always wanted, huh?"

Sam throws a half smile in his brother's direction, knowing him too well.

Dean's eyes glints. "Any catch I need to know before messing up the time?"

Tip of Sam's mouth twitches. "Just like you said but, eh... don't mess up the time too much? Butterfly effect, remember? We just came back from the Titanic world like, last week?"

Dean returns an unimpressed look. "Let me, umm, just try one more time, just to be sure."

Glancing up, he prays hard and loud, "Castiel, Angel of the Lord, if you have your ears on, come pick us up here, alright? Or we're gonna do something that *possibly* could break the history, you hear me?"

He waits. One second. Two seconds. Three seconds. No stir of air, no wings, no feathered angel. No Cas.

Dean breathes out. "Okay then, let's do this, make some noise! Fun time!"

"Umm," Sam has a look of reluctance, slowly sitting back down.

Dean narrows his eyes. "You're not coming with me."

Sam spreads his hands wide, empty palms facing up -- all they have is a big pile of nothing. Resigned, he says, "Look, Dean, I know how much faith you have on Cas, I really hope I do too, but we just don't know. We could break the history and timeline and everything, and Cas might never come, and we would still be stuck here. I'm gonna find another way, a spell or something, things we can do *by ourselves*, swim our way back if we can."

"And you'll just stay here the whole time, researching?" Dean throws a quick glance at the stairs leading out of the cellar. "Samuel here doesn't look like he welcomes any guest, let alone long-term tenant."

"Not too different from Bobby?" Sam curls up his lips a little.

Dean considers, huffing a quiet laughter. "Yeah, right, we are professionals in handling half-retired grumpy old drunk hunters."

They exchange an agreeing look. So it is decided.

Dean stands up, moving around the table, leaning in to give his brother a half-hug.

"See you around then, Sammy." He pats his back slightly before pulling back. "I'll drop by picking you up after I find Cas."

"And how do I find you, if I find the spell?" Sam asks.

Dean smiles. "Read the newspaper."

<br>

"So, you finally decide to move on?" Elkins gives him a once-over. "Where's your brother?"

Dean has a red bandana wrapped around his mouth. He changed into new shirt and pant -- new for him, old for the clothes -- dirt and stains making him look exactly like the rest of the folks in the place.

*The look of a pilgrim,* Dean realizes.

He doesn't answer. Just strides straight into the room, heading directly for the bartender they've grown familiar with over the past couple of days. Dean lets out a breath, tasting a tad of bitterness lingering on the tip of his tongue.

Drawing the pistol from the holster at his waist in a smooth swing, he fires three shots into the ceiling. Some girls scream behind him.

Elkins looks at him, reaching for something hidden underneath the bar stand. Supposedly a shotgun.

"I wouldn't recommend that." Dean shifts his aim toward him. The bartender stops moving, hands slowly rising.

"What's this about?" The old man is still surprisingly chill, not even showing much curiosity.

*Just how many gangsters has he run into before?* Dean finds himself wondering.

"What every outlaw around here wants," he says, aiming for a deep, grave voice. "You got any hidden treasure around here? Gold would do too."

"At least leave me a name to pass your story along?" Elkins reaches for a side drawer. The gold he offers includes some of the very pieces they paid for their meals over the past few days. Dean has to push down the unease.

"Eastwood. Clint Eastwood. Best gunner in the western world," Dean tells him, with a mocking smile.

"We'll see about that." Three gunshots are released within the next second. Not Dean's this time. He dives behind an overturned dining table. A bullet narrowly misses his cheek, air squeaks sharp.

"Son of a bitch!" He shouts out. Dirt on the ground flies into air, the room is hazy for a second. He can't see much.

Dean blinks hard, looking left and right, trying to figure out what now.

"What the hell?" he thinks out loud. Guess the first rodeo isn't always very successful even for bonafide western gangsters.

"Well, *Hell* sends regards." Elkins' steps are right in front of the table. Dean risks a glimpse, catching the sight of black eyes.

"Freaking demon!" He growls, at the same time of ducking into a gap between the stools, exactly when the table he was hiding behind gets shot a gun hole around the place where his heart would have been.

A second gun shot is fired from behind him. Damnnit, *demons*, plural. A whackload of them, it seems.

He hears giggling from the same direction where the gunshot comes, the place where the saloon ladies usually gather. If they are all possessed, he counts four already.

Even with the Colt he hasn't really had won any advantage over that many demons all at once, and god knows how many more might crawling in as they speak.

"Surprised to see us?" Elkins' voice sounds harsh and edgy, nothing like what he sounded like when he spoke with them in the past. "We kill everyone close to Samuel Colt, just so you know."

"Huh, usually the other way around," Dean amuses. "So this is how it's like to have someone more famous than us around."

"You are some big name, boy?" The demon in Elkins smirks.

"That's the goal." Dean answers absent-mindedly, while tightens the grip on the pistol, silently counting the number of bullets he has left. *A bit low on ammo already,* he shifts the grip slightly, thinking, *he has to figure a way out fast*.

The exit door are two tables' distance away, with the three lady demons in between, but the side window is only one table away, with buckets of alcohols within range. He calculates his route.

The demons circle closer. Their footsteps heavy, dresses of the ladies rustled relentlessly.

Dean risks another look from the edge of his hideout. All of them has a gun in their hands. Since when do demons kill human with guns? Western cowboy demons? He teases the thought, finding it not as unpleasant as he thought.

The demon possessing the bartender lets out a raspy laughter. "You will die, Clint Eastwood."

"Huh, it's actually nice hearing people say that, you know. Leaving the name behind is sorta the point." Dean estimates the timing and the distance, swinging a stool at the foot of the closest demon girl, diving side way. Darla, the saloon girl cornered him the first day, yells angrily, eyes turning black, swooping for him.

"Sorry about that." Dean says, a bit apologetically. Then dives for the bucket stack, kicking them loose.

A bucket rolls toward the center of the saloon, alcohol leaking from a crack, leaving a wet trail as it goes. The second one follows, making the trail a pool, soaking the next one inside out.

Dean leaps out of the place through the window right before the demons shoot the spot he was in. Bullets and sparks catch the alcohol, the whole place turns into a big pile of flame and smoke in seconds. Demons hiss furiously inside.

The second floor crashes down in the flame. Dean only then realizes he forgets to check if there is any human up there, but it's too late already.

He unleashes the horse by the stable, galloping out of the town, heading west without looking back.

<br>

He doesn't slow down until the burning hut is completely out of view. The sun is setting ahead of him on the horizon. He eases the rein, letting the horse stroll.

Dean glances back at the wild plain territory behind him, barely anything to see. Barren and wild, no sign of civilization.

"No coming back to Sunrise, Wyoming now." He sighs, patting the duffel bag and roll of blanket wrapped tightly on the back of the horse, the same way he'd check the Impala's trunk has everything he needs for the road.

Dean removes the Sheriff's pin from his shirt. "Didn't expect the first gig end up like that, goddamn demons always ruin the day."

He strokes the neck of the horse gently, speaking to her as much as to himself, "What do you think, it's a loud enough distress call to Cas or not?"

He looks up at the sky. The night is falling slowly, the color transitions from dark blue to deep purple. Some stars that are incredibly bright already start shining and blinking above these lands. Light pollution isn't a thing yet.

Pure universe hanging on top of him like a gigantic globe hull, celestial, but not in a biblical way.

Dean lets his fingers combing through horse's hair, feeling the creature's muscle rise and fall as it jogs. "Yeah, I know." He says quietly, "Probably not."

Him not being home already is proof by itself.

"Looks like just you and me and the whole wild west now, Baby." He pats the horse. "Come on then, let's head west and make some more noise, he'd have to hear one of them. Good thing all the land between here and the ocean are free to go."

The whole wild west ahead of him, free to explore.

But Dean isn't anywhere near ecstasy. It's just too damn far away from home.
