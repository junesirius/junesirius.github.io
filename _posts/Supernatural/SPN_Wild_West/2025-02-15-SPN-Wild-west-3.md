"Get out of my house." Samuel Colt grumbles, without bothering lifting his head. His colt on the desk by his hand -- a normal one, not the special one he'd already given to them.

"I'm really sorry to bother you again," Sam steps gingerly ahead, Dean follows him a few feet behind. "I wouldn't bother you if it's not absolute urgent."

"Thought I already did my share of help." he eyes them. "Don't tell me the Colt didn't work on the creature you're hunting."

"No, it's not that." Dean chimes in, "It worked, but uh... it's something else we can use a little help there."

"Which part of I'm retired failed you?"

Samuel is clearly not an easy one to approach, Dean decides.

"Like I said, in our time, you're sort of a really big deal, a famous hunter-- " Sam manages a tight smile, as friendly as he can pull.

"Heard you the first time."

"So we figure you'd be the best supernatural researcher around here too." Dean pulls an puffery grin.

"Please, we are not asking you to hunt with us or anything," Sam continues. "Just need a little help in research."

<br>

It turns out their guess isn't too far off. Samuel has as big of a book collection as Bobby's or Campbell's, right downstairs in the place where a cellar should be, but with tons more additional traps and sigils painted on every inch of floor and wall.

Panic room *and* library, nice. Classic. Dean looks around, thinking how *fun* it must be to be able to spending all the time reading while hiding out here.

Sam nudges him, eyeing the rows of books. He nods back.

Research time.

<br>

"Don't you think if there's a way to pull it off here and now, someone would have done that?" Dean puts a book after a few hours, wiping his face by his hands, giving his brain some break. "But why didn't we run into people time traveled from the past all the time?"

Sam doesn't move his eyes away from whatever he's scanning. "They don't know what we know." he says.

But they don't know much about this time thing, either. Dean thinks. It's always just Cas swinging them around, or some other douchebag angels occasionally. Just popping in and out, not really much theory or science to learn about.

Should probably have asked a few more questions about how time flux thing works. He realizes belatedly. But after all, not everyone is as nerdy as Sam.

"I just remember Cas said once that time travel isn't easy but not impossible," Dean thinks hard, poking some piece of old memory, the time when he met mom and dad when they were younger than his age, the other time when they were trying to stop the yellow-eyed demon but still failed utterly, even the time when he got flipped to the messed-up five years into the zombie land future that turns out never would come. What did Cas tell him during those short talks?

"He said that time is fluid, it's not easy, but apparently the angels have no problem bending it once in a while."

Sam jerks his head up, eyes bright with understanding, "And he also told us this time before we left, that the further back he sent us, the harder it becomes to retrieve us, that's why he said we can't stay for more than 24 hours, or we'd be lost to him."

"Which means we are totally lost to him by now and no way home without the wings." Dean says grimly.

"No, Dean!" Sam jumps to his feet, excited. "I think that's exactly our solution! This book here also said something similar, quite many are saying the same thing actually, I just didn't realize they might be literal, thought it's more metaphorical."

He slides a book over, "Imagine the time is like river or something, fluid, rapid turbulence flow of some kind, and each of us is like a floating leaf. Cas can bend the water so it becomes non-chronological, the downstream touches the upstream, that's how we land here. And folding some part off would be to fast-forward into the future. But if we stay here for too long, we are like the leaves washed away by the flow by too far, that's probably why he can't find us, because he doesn't know where we are in the time flux anymore."

Dean's brows tie into a knot. "So... what's our way out again?"

"We just need to make some *noise*, making us stand out in the timeline so he can find us, sending out some temporal beacons -- assuming he's out there looking for us." Sam's voice gets quieter at the last clause.

"He's out there." Dean nods firmly, almost reflexively.

"Ok." he considers again, starting a minor smile. "Sounds like a plan to me. What kind of noise are we talking about?"

Sam looks a little caught up by the question, shrugging unsurely. "What do I know? Something big enough to get some notice for us in the future, I'd guess? I would definitely notice if your face show up in some old western posters, guess you can finally make a name for yourself in this era like you always wanted, huh?"

Sam throws a half smile in his brother's direction, knowing him too well.

Dean's eyes glints. "Any catch I need to know before messing up the time?"

Tip of Sam's mouth twitches. "Just like you said but... don't mess up the time too much?"

Dean returns the look. "Let me, umm, just try one last time, just to be sure."

Glancing up, he prays loud, "Cas, if you have your ears on, come pick us up here, March the tenth, Sunrise, Wyoming, alright? Or we're gonna do something that *possibly* could break the history, you hear me?"

He waits. One second. Two seconds. Three seconds. No stir of air, no wings, no feathered angel. No Cas.

Dean breathes out. "Ok then, let's do this."

<br>

"So you boys finally decide to move on now?" Elkins eyes their looks.

Dean has a red bandana wrapped around his mouth, Sam has a black one. They change into new shirts and pants -- new for them, old by the look of the clothes, dirt and stain make them look exactly like the rest of the folks in the saloon.

The look of pilgrim, Dean realizes.

He doesn't nod or shake. Just charges directly into the room, going straight to the bartender that they've grown familiar with by each day. Dean lets out a breath. Tastes a tad of bitter on tip of his tongue.

Drawing the pistol out of the holster by his waist in a smooth swing, he fires towards the ceiling three times. Some girl screams behind him, he knows Sam must also have his gun drew out, pointing somewhere.

Elkins looks at him, reaching for something underneath the bar stand. Supposedly a shotgun.

"I wouldn't suggest that." Dean points the gun at him. The bartender stops moving, raising the hands.

"What's that about?" The old man is still surprisingly calm, not even showing enough of curiosity.

How many of these kinds of gangsters has he seen before, Dean finds himself wondering.

"What every mobster around here wants," he says, aiming for a deep, grave voice. "You got any hidden treasure around here? Otherwise gold would do too."

"At least leave me a name to pass your story?" Elkins reaches for the side drawer. The gold he offers include some of those they paid in the past few days for their food. Dean has to push down the uneasiness.

"Eastwood, Clint Eastwood. Best gunner in the western world." Dean tells him.

"We'll see about that." Three gunshots are released at almost the same second. Dean dives behind an overturned dining table. A bullet barely misses his cheek.

"Son of a bitch!" He shouts out. Dirt on the ground flies into air, the room is hazy for a second. He can't see much.

"Sam!" Dean looks left and right, trying to figure out what now.

"I'm ok!" Sam yells back, somewhere behind him, probably using a different table as shelter.

"What the hell?" he thinks out loud. The first robbery isn't always very successful even for western gangsters, is it?

"Well, Hell sends regards." Elkins's steps are right in front of the table. Dean risks a glimpse, catching the sight of black eyes.

"Demon!" He warns Sam, at the same time of ducking into a gap between the stools, exactly when the desk he was hiding behind gets shot a gun hole around the place where his heart would have been.

"Where are they coming from?" Sam moves closer to him, looking at a different direction.

"They?" Dean alerts.

"The ladies at the back." Sam explains. "Darla and at least two other, already counting four here."

Even with the Colt they haven't really had won any advantage with that many demons all at once, and god knows how many more might crawling in as they speak.

"Surprised to see us?" Elkins's voice sounds harsh and edgy, nothing like what he sounds like when he spoke with them in the past. "We kill everyone close to Samuel Colt, just so you know."

"Huh, usually the other way around," Dean amuses. "So this is how it's like to have someone more famous than us around."

Sam spares him a glare, "Not funny, Dean! And not the time!"

"Right," Dean tightens the grip on the pistol, counting the number of bullets he has left in the heart, "a little low on ammo here, any idea?"

Sam shares a look with him while nodding at the exit door. Dean gives him a thumb up, finger drawing a circle and then pointing at himself. Sam nods in understanding.

From the sound of their surrounding footsteps, demons are circling closer.

"Bullet can kill us but we can't kill you, a little unfair, isn't it?" Dean raises his voice from behind the hideout. Tone teasing.

The demon possessing the bartender lets out a raspy laughter. "You will die, Clint Eastwood."

"Huh, it's actually nice hearing people say that, you know. Leaving the name behind is sorta the point." Dean estimates the timing and the distance, swinging a stool at the foot of the closest demon girl, diving side way. Darla, the saloon girl cornered him the first day, yells angrily, eyes turning black.

"Sorry about that." Dean says, apologetically. Then, "Sam! Now!"

A bucket rolls towards him, soaked inside out with alcohol. Dean jumps out of the place, right after firing at the bucket, turning the whole place into a big pile of flame and smoke. Demons hiss furiously inside.

The two boys unleash the horses by the stable, galloping out of the town, heading west.

<br>

They don't slow down until the burning hut is completely out of view. The sun is setting ahead of them on the horizon. They let the horses stroll.

Dean glances back at the wild plain territory behind them, barely anything to see. Barren and wild, no sign of civilization.

"Guess no coming back to Sunrise, Wyoming now." He sighs, patting at the duffel bag and roll of bedding wrapped tightly on the back of the horse, letting out a long breath. "Didn't expect the first gig would end up like that."

"The robbing part or the demon part?" Sam eyes him sideways.

Dean considers, almost laughing, "You know what, the worst part is I don't know which is worse. But do you think it's big enough of a stress signal to Cas now?"

Sam looks up at the sky. The night is falling, the stars are incredibly bright on these lands. Pure universe, celestial but not in a biblical way. "Probably not." he murmurs.

"Yeah." Dean has to agree, them not being home already is proof by itself. "Come on then, let's head west and make some more noise, he'd have to hear one of them. Good thing all the land between here and sea are free to go."

The whole wild west ahead of them, free to explore.

Dean isn't anywhere near lying in the pool of ecstasy. It's just too damn far away from home.
