The posse is relentless. They travel across bushes and water that should have covered their traces. And when they hide out behind rocky mountains, their horses are still moving their way, not diverted by the slightest, like hunting dogs catching the scent of prey and never let go.

"Where are they coming from?" Dean wonders aloud. "How can they even follow us like this, we just passed the whole prairie. I don't even know where we are now."

"Must be Indians." Butch looks at them through a monocular, then passes the telescope to Dean. "Some tribes are amazing trackers. They'll never lose the scent once they pick it up until they're dead."

"Awesome." Dean murmurs, emotionlessly.

Sometimes by day, they manage to put another hundreds of miles in between their distance and think it should be safe now. Then by night, once they stop for a few hours of sleep, the shaking lantern lights show up again on the horizon.

"Don't they ever need sleep or let the horses eat and drink or something?" Dean complains as he mounts the horse.

The western life is no fun now -- not like the first few months are entertaining when he was robbing banks and trains, but at least better than having to keep running for his life. He even has nightmares of those shaking lanterns in the distance. Never close enough to grab a clear view, but always there on their tails. It's like some old saying goes, they're like the shadow of death, always there following you closely so you have to keep moving. And one day, when you move too slowly, or sleep for too long, they'll catch up.

"We should probably split up." Dean pants, when they are on the rocky mountains in Colorado. Stones and rocks roll unstably at the horses' feet, falling into the cliff and the creek down below. "Easier to take down three four than having the whole dozen of them chasing us all like Nazgul's."

"I don't know who that is, but sounds like a plan to me." Butch says, frowning to the way they come from. The posse isn't in the view yet, but they all know they're not far behind.

Dean shakes hands with them both.

Butch pats his back. "Take care, brother."

Dean gives him a cowboy salute.

Same with the Sundance Kid.

Dean keeps going north. He doesn't keep track of where Butch and Sundance are going. They might head east now, likely. Kansas is worth a visit and they can probably do those things the papers said they did but they haven't got chance to. Dean thinks, urging the horse to keep up the pace again.

There are more than half a dozen of the posse following him, by the count of the shaky lanterns.

"Damn it." Dean curses under his breath. That's the wrong math, he should get only a third, not like almost all of them.

Don't they want to follow the other two? They should have made a bigger name than already does, according to the history.

But meanwhile, Dean finds himself smirking at the fact if they prefer to follow him, it must mean he has been quite a big deal to whoever recruited them. Then hopefully that's also a big enough of a noise to Cas.

<br>

He rides into a town by the nightfall from the back. The crappy place feels somewhat familiar. The smell of horse dung and sand, the shape of the road and houses along the way.

Dean blinks at the night view of the town, approaching a two-level house that feels most calling. He gets down from the horse and sneaks in after lock picked the door.

And he curses his own stupid mistake.

The sheriff's office where he had briefly been assigned to little more than months ago. The place where the deputy was shot by a phoenix.

He is back to Sunrise, Wyoming. The town he should never come back, considering the demon encounter.

He rushes to the door, and hears long and painful whinny of his horse when a gunshot unmistakably has shot her.

"I'm so sorry, Baby." Dean puts his head on the doorframe for a second, mourning the loss of the creature that has accompanied him day and night for months when no one else did.

More clops sound up outside of the place. Men's rushed footsteps surrounding from all sides. By the sound of all the shouts and yells, some remain on the horsebacks, circling the building in trotting steps, others readying the guns and rifles, the clicks of the safety switch are loud and clear. There are people in the lead shouting something, then some answering voices. He can't hear them clearly but he can't miss the determination in those voices. They would take him down for good, and he has no escape this time.

He wonders briefly if those people are human or demons, then realizes it makes no difference at all -- they would want him dead either way.

Dean looks around the office, already knows for sure there is no secret passageway. He can also fight bloody and ugly, go down swinging just like how the movie shows for the ending of great Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Except there will be no freeze frame for him. This is real life, so he would just become a whole body of gun holes and dead meat. And his mind jumps back to an image of mourning Cas and crying Sam, eyes red and swollen for both of them; or worse, an image of Cas beaten up and killed by the archangel, and Sam dying of old age in the western, before twentieth century starts.

No way out, except for flying.

Dean loads all the guns he can find in the place. The pistols and rifles he gathers with him during all these times, some shotguns probably belong to the new sheriff of the town, standing at the back of the office by the wall.

He finds more ammo too, taking them to the sheriff's office desk, just to be prepared.

Finished all these works, he leans against the desk, closes his eyes.

His fingers are tight around the pistols so he can't quite cross them properly in front of his chest, so he settles with putting them on the laps.

"Castiel, please, I need you." Dean thinks, really thinking hard and desperately like never before, picturing his features in his mind like how he would stand in front of him. He hates the bleeding tone of begging in his prayer, but he can't think of another way, so he keeps it going. "At least come get Sammy and make sure he's safe. October the twenty fourth, 1861, Sunrise, Wyoming. Please --"

And then, like a slow motion moment, unmistakably, there is the most beautiful sound of wings fluttering, air stirs. Dean gasps in relief before opening his eyes.

"Cas --" He starts, then stops dead, "Who are you?"

The man in front of him is at least five inches taller than him, wearing uniforms, soldier looking.

The stranger squints at him, and says in a low voice, "You pray too loud. I really don't know why you act like we know each other."

"Castiel," Dean realizes, relieved and tensed at the same time, not sure to smile or glare, so he stares. "I almost forget how big of an asshole you were before."

"As an Angel of the Lord, I come with orders," he declares solemnly. "There are beings who don't belong to this era and constantly disturb the timeline, and I am here to eliminate them. You are one of the three."

"Great, fly me back to my page of the calendar, and problem solved." Dean says, hopefully. Meanwhile -- *Wait, three? Does that mean... Cas? Cas, goddamnit, come in, this is Houston, can you hear me?*

"No, the order is to exterminate the threat to the timeline, not assist them." The Castiel from this timeline raises his hand, eyes start glaring with angelic lights.

Dean dodges aside, having no other way of self defense but to press the trigger. Guns won't do him any harm, but hopefully to distract long enough until he figures out something.

As he dumps the bullets into this Castiel's body, the door is crashed open. He doesn't have time to check if the posse has break through the barricade he sets there, the only thought remains is: *He's gonna die for sure this time*.

Dean's eyes stare at the Angel's, the guns in his hands run out of the bullet, and he doesn't want to take his eyes away to reload. Stepping back step by step until his back is pressed to the wall, he clicks the empty guns, feeling the desperation accumulating so much that it drowns him and squeezed his heart dead even before he gets smitten by Castiel.

And then, the lights in Castiel's eyes start dimming, as if something is forcing him back down. He looks confused and turns around. There is another man behind him in some old farmer's clothes.

Castiel is visibly surprised, with a growling voice, the lights in the room start shaking and blinking, then go out. But the thundering noise rolls louder, and flash of lights shine in the room. Shadow of a large pair of black wings spread in the space. Dean watches in awe, eyes stinging from the brightness of the light, fingers numb by the force it holds on the pistol's handle. He squints the eyes but keeps watching.

The other man is not intimated. In the lights that are too dazzling to see, he lights up too. Blue white light pouring from his eyes, flash and thunder, then the wings.

"Cas." Dean mumbles the name, knowing without doubt it is his Cas, the Cas he has known for three years and been praying to for the whole time when he's in here. Here he is, months late, but finally, here he is.

Cas's lights unsteady for a second at Dean's voice, but stables himself quickly enough. The old-era western Castiel is still here, menacing, hostile. "You're the second one on the list." He says.

Cas doesn't answer, the wings flapping, taking his body higher in the air. Castiel follows him, flying to the ceiling. The sheriff's office is visibly too small for them, but they fight and attack and defend all alone.

For some minutes, Dean thinks his Cas is going to lose. He wrestles and struggles, as if the muscle from his old body is too tired or weak, but then he'd realize, the angels must not fight in the vessel. The bodies are just here as a representation, the real them must be wresting in the dimension he cannot see.

"Cas, come on. This is yourself." Dean wants help so badly, but on the other hand, wouldn't he hurt Cas too if he hurts his older self? He hates timeline dilemma.

He can do nothing but stares and waits. The sounds outside of the building -- if those posse and horses are still there besieging him -- can't be heard anymore, compared to the thunderous sound of the fighting above him.

And then, the fight concludes. Dean's heart thumps to his throat when the lights in the room start going out, and the two bodies fall back to the floor slowly, with one in standing posture, the other horizontal.

"Cas?" Dean blinks hard, trying to get adjusted to the view, trying to see who is the one left standing. Then he sees it.

The one standing is the Cas he knows, in Jimmy Novak's vessel.

His eyes still have glaring angelic lights, his palm pressed on the head of his old self, whose lights are dimming as the grace is extracting from the point they touch.

Then the process finishes. Cas leaves that soldier's vessel on the ground. There is no sign of an angel in that nerveless body, no showing of whether the Castiel from this timeline is still in that body or if he's still alive.

Dean stares at him, "Cas?" He gasps, finding his throat choked. "Did you just... kill the other you?"

"No," Cas meets his gaze, and holds it. The familiar stare between them, the one that is soothing and anchoring. "I just absorbed the grace I needed, and wiped the memory to avoid any paradox."

Dean gestures the lifeless body uncertainly. "Wouldn't that hurt... you? The old you?"

And Cas answers, tone flat, "He has plenty time to recover, I don't."

"God, you're cruel to yourself." Dean wipes the corner of his eyes, closing the distance between them, wrapping his arms around Cas tight, his chin pressed on his shoulder. "Thank goodness you're here. So good to see you again."

Cas puts his arms around Dean's back, and presses him hard. He swallows, and says quietly, "Hello, Dean."

There is something in his voice gives Dean a shivering chill. He pulls back, still keeping a hand on Cas's shoulder. By the sheer light leaking into the place from outside, he checks Cas up and down, frowning at his farmer's shirt and cowboy's pants. So uncomfortably blended in and human look. He looks more disheveled than Dean ever remembers, dirt and dust cover his face and clothes like he's been on the road for so long that the sand from the wild west has already carved into his skin. The look that belongs to all the cowboys from this era.

Dean looks at him in the eyes, "Where have you been?"

"When." Cas corrects.

"What?" Dean gasps, slow realization falls on him. "How long have you been here?"

"Twenty years."

"Cas --"

"I landed too early, so I have to wait for you to catch up, wait for time to pass in the old, slow way." Cas says, in plain tone.

"I prayed to you, all the time." Dean chokes out.

"I know." Cas's eyes glint with bitterness. "I wish I could get to you sooner."

Dean asks, squeezing his shoulder, to steady himself. "What happened?"
