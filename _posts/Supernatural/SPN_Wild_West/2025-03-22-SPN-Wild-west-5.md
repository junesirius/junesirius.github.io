The posse is relentless. They travel across bushes and water that should have covered their traces. And when Dean and the gang hide out behind rocky mountains, their horses are still moving their way, not diverted in the slightest, like hunting dogs catching the scent of prey and never letting go.

"Where are they coming from?" Dean wonders aloud. "How can they even follow us like this, we just passed the whole prairie. I don't even know where we are now."

"Must be Indians." Butch looks at them through a monocular, then passes the telescope to Dean. "Some tribes are amazing trackers. They'll never lose the scent once they pick it up until they're dead."

"Awesome," Dean murmurs, emotionlessly.

Sometimes by day, they manage to put another hundred miles between them and think it should be safe now. Then by night, once they stop for a few hours of sleep, the shaking lantern lights show up again on the horizon.

"Don't they ever need sleep or let the horses eat and drink or something?" Dean complains as he mounts the horse, yearning in tiredness.

The western life is no fun now -- not like the first few months were entertaining when he was robbing banks and trains, but at least better than having to keep running for his life. He even has nightmares of those shaking lanterns in the distance. Never close enough to get a clear view of the faces, but always there on their tails. It's like some old saying goes, they're like the faceless shadow of death, always there following you closely so you have to keep moving. And one day, when you move too slowly, or sleep for too long, they'll catch up.

"We should probably split up," Dean pants, when they are on the rocky mountains in Colorado. Stones and rocks roll unstably at the horses' feet, falling into the cliff and the creek down below. "Easier to take down three or four than having the whole dozen of them chasing us all like Nazguls."

"I don't know who that is, but sounds like a plan to me," Butch says, frowning at the way they came from. The posse isn't in view yet, but they all know they're not far behind.

Dean shakes hands with them both.

Butch pats his back. "Take care, brother."

Dean gives him a cowboy salute.

Same with the Sundance Kid.

Dean keeps going north. He doesn't keep track of where Butch and Sundance are headed. They might head east now, likely. Kansas is worth a visit and they can probably do those things the papers said they did but they haven't had the chance to. Dean thinks, urging the horse to pick up the pace again.

There are more than half a dozen of the posse following him, by the count of the shaky lanterns.

"Damn it," Dean curses under his breath. That's the wrong math, he should have gotten only a third, not almost all of them.

Don't they want to follow the other two? They should have made a bigger name than he already has, according to history.

But meanwhile, Dean finds himself smirking at the fact that if they prefer to follow him, it must mean he has been quite a big deal to whoever recruited them. Then hopefully that's also a big enough noise for Cas.

<br>

He rides into a town by nightfall from the back. The crappy place feels somewhat familiar. The smell of horse dung and sand, the shape of the road and houses along the way.

Dean blinks at the night view of the town, approaching a two-level house that feels the most calling. He gets down from the horse and sneaks in after picking the lock on the door.

And he curses his own stupid mistake.

The sheriff's office where he had briefly been assigned to little more than six months ago. The place where the deputy was shot by the phoenix.

He is back in Sunrise, Wyoming. The town he should never have come back to, considering the demon encounter.

He rushes to the door, and hears the long and painful whinny of his horse when a gunshot unmistakably strikes her.

"I'm so sorry, Baby," Dean puts his head against the doorframe for a second, mourning the loss of the beautiful creature that had accompanied him day and night for months when no one else did.

More clopping sounds rise up outside. Men's rushed footsteps surround the place from all sides. By the sound of all the shouting and yelling, some remain on horseback, circling the building at a trot, others are readying their guns and rifles, the clicks of safeties snapping off loud and clear. There is someone in the lead shouting something, and others answering back with boiling excitement and vengeance. Dean can't make out the words but he can't miss the determination in their voices. These people mean to take him down for good for whatever he did, and he has no escape this time.

He wonders briefly if those people are human or demons, then realizes it makes no difference at all -- they want him dead either way. So very western.

Dean looks around the office, already knowing for sure there is no secret passageway. He could also fight bloody and ugly, go down swinging just like how the movie shows for the ending of great Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Except there will be no freeze frame for him. This is real life, so he would just become a whole body of bullet holes and dead meat. And his mind jumps to a flashing image of a mourning Cas and a crying Sam, eyes red and swollen on both of them; or worse, an image of Cas beaten up and killed by a ruthless archangel, and Sam spending the rest of his life alone and dying of old age here in a shabby hut like Samuel's, in the West, before the twentieth century even begins.

No way out, except flying.

Dean loads all the guns he can find in the place. The pistols and rifles he's gathered with him during all these times, plus some shotguns likely belonging to the new sheriff of the town, stacked against the back wall of the office.

He finds more ammo too, dragging it to the sheriff's desk, just to be prepared.

Finished all these works, he leans against the desk, and closes his eyes.

His fingers are tight around the pistols so he can't quite cross them properly in front of his chest, so he settles with putting them on his lap.

"Castiel, please, I need you," Dean thinks, really thinking hard and desperately like never before, picturing his features in his mind like how he would stand in front of him. He hates the bleeding tone of begging in his prayer, but he can't think of another way, so he keeps it going. "At least come get Sammy and make sure he's safe. October the twenty fourth, 1861, Sunrise, Wyoming. Please --"

And then, like a slow motion moment, unmistakably, there is the most beautiful sound of wings fluttering, the air stirs. Dean gasps in relief before opening his eyes.

"Cas --" he starts, then stops dead. "Who are you?"

The man in front of him is at least five inches taller than him, wearing a uniform, soldier-looking.

The stranger squints at him, and says in a low voice, "You pray too loud. I really don't know why you act like we know each other."

"Castiel," Dean realizes, relieved and tensed at the same time, not sure whether to smile or glare, so he just stares. "I almost forget how big of an asshole you were before."

"As an Angel of the Lord, I come with orders," he declares solemnly. "There are beings who don't belong to this era and who constantly disturb the timeline. I am here to eliminate them. You are one of the three."

"Great, fly me back to my page on the calendar, and problem solved," Dean says, hopefully. Meanwhile -- *Wait, three? Does that mean... Cas? Cas, goddamnit, come in, this is Houston, can you hear me?*

"Wrong, the order is to exterminate the threat to the timeline, not assist them," the Castiel from this era raises his hand, his eyes beginning to glow with angelic light.

Dean dodges aside, having no other way of self-defense but to press the trigger. Bullets won't do him any harm, but hopefully to distract him long enough until he figures something out.

As he dumps the bullets into this Castiel's body, the door is crashed open. He doesn't have time to check if the posse has broken through the barricade he set there, the only thought remaining in Dean's mind is: *I'm gonna die for sure this time*.

Dean's eyes stare at the Angel, the guns in his hands click empty, running out of bullets, and he doesn't dare take his eyes away to reload. Stepping back step by step until his back is pressed to the wall, he keeps clicking the empty guns uselessly, feeling the despair accumulating so much that it chokes him and squeezes his heart dead even before he can get smitten by Castiel.

And then, the lights in Castiel's eyes flicker, dimming as if something is forcing him back down. He looks confused and turns around. There is another man behind him in some old farmer's clothes.

Castiel is visibly surprised, with a growling voice, the lights in the room start shaking, so does the whole building and the ground. The lights blinking, then go out entirely. But a rolling thunder rolls loud, and a flash of lightning shines in the room. A massive shadow of a large pair of black wings spread in the space.

Dean watches, awestruck, his eyes stinging from the brightness of the light, his fingers numb from the force they grip the pistols. He squints his eyes but refuses to look away.

The other man is not intimidated. In the blinding lights that are too dazzling to see, he lights up too. Blue-white light pours from his eyes, flash and thunder follow, then the wings as tremendous as the Angel's, filling the space with equal force.

"Cas," Dean mumbles, the name falling from his lips without hesitation, knowing without doubt it is his Cas, the Cas he has known for three years and been praying to for the whole time he's in here. Here he is, months late, but finally, here he is.

Cas's lights flicker unsteadily for a second at Dean's voice, but he stabilizes himself quickly enough. The old-era western Castiel is still here, menacing, hostile.

"You're the second one on the list," the soldier-Castiel growls.

Cas doesn't answer, his wings flapping, lifting his body higher in the air. The other Castiel follows him, flying toward the ceiling. The sheriff's office is visibly too small for them, but they fight and attack and defend all the same. Fierce and violent.

For a few terrible minutes, Dean thinks his Cas is going to lose. He wrestles and struggles, as if the muscles from his old body are too tired or frail, but then Dean realizes, angels must not be fighting in the vessel forms. The bodies are just here as a representation, the real them must be battling in a dimension he cannot see.

"Cas, come on. This is crazy, it's yourself," Dean wants to help desperately, thinking helplessly. But on the other hand, even if he could do something, wouldn't he be hurting his Cas too if he hurt his older self? He hates timeline dilemmas. He doesn't even know which version of Cas would hear his prayers, or if both would.

He can do nothing but stare and wait. The noise outside of the building -- if those posse and horses are still there besieging him -- can't be heard anymore, drowned out by the thunderous sound of the fighting above him.

And then, the fight ends. Dean's heart thumps into his throat as the room falls still. The dazzling lights go out, and two bodies fall back to the floor slowly, with one in a standing posture, the other horizontal.

"Cas?" Dean blinks hard, trying to get adjusted to the view, desperate to see who is the one left standing. Then he sees it.

It is the Cas he knows, his Cas, in Jimmy Novak's vessel.

His eyes still have glaring angelic lights, his palm pressed on the head of his old self, whose lights are dimming as the grace is extracted and transmitted from the point they touch.

Then the process is over. Cas leaves that soldier's body slumped to the floor. There is no sign of an angel in that nerveless body, no showing of whether the Castiel from this timeline is still in that body or if he's still alive.

Dean stares at him, "Cas?" he gasps, finding his throat choked. "Did you just... kill the other you?"

"No," Cas meets his gaze, and holds it. The familiar stare between them, the one that is soothing, grounding. "I just absorbed the grace I needed, and wiped the memory to avoid any paradox."

Dean gestures toward the lifeless body uncertainly. "Wouldn't that hurt... you? The old you?"

And Cas answers, his tone flat, "He has plenty of time to recover, I don't."

"God, you're cruel to yourself." Dean wipes the corner of his eyes, closing the distance between them, wrapping his arms around Cas tightly, his chin pressed against his shoulder. "Thank goodness you're here. So good to see you again, buddy."

Cas puts his arms around Dean's back, and presses him hard. He swallows, and says quietly, "Hello, Dean."

There is something in his voice that gives Dean a shivering chill. It's too tight, too much forced calm, suppressed and controlled. He pulls back, still keeping a hand on Cas's shoulder. By the sheer light leaking into the room from outside, he checks Cas up and down, frowning at his farmer's shirt and cowboy pants. So uncomfortably perfectly blended in, so human. He looks more disheveled than Dean ever remembers, dirt and dust covering his face and clothes like he's been on the road for so long that the sand of the Wild West has already carved itself into his skin. The look that belongs to all the cowboys of this era.

Dean looks him in the eyes. "Where have you been?"

"When." Cas corrects.

"What?" Dean gasps, slow realization crashing down on him. "How long have you been here?"

"Twenty years."

"Cas --"

"I landed too early, so I had to wait for you to catch up, wait for time to pass the old, slow way," Cas says, in a plain tone.

"I prayed to you, all the time," Dean chokes out.

"I know." Cas's eyes glint with bitterness. "I wish I could have gotten to you sooner."

Dean asks, squeezing his shoulder, trying to steady himself. "What happened?"
