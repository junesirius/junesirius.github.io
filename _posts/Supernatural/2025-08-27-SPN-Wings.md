Summary: It starts with Castiel losing his wings, and going through a whole journey until he finds something.

<br>

The pain in his bloodied, scratched palm on the asphalt road is the first thing Castiel notices when he falls.

The burning on his shoulder blades the second.

He never knew pain was such a sharp, acute sensation -- he had known pain when he was a full-powered angel and got wounded during battles with demons eons ago. Those were not pain, he realized, not the way humans define the word anyway. Those were more like burnings, a heat made of fire and sulphur torching the light and grace that was his true form. An impact on his true form, a harmful change in the temperature, a darkening over the photonic wavelength, a staining on his color and light -- but never a *sensation*.

And now, walking on the Earth as a complete human for the first time, made of blood and flesh, he's feeling the sensations for the first time. He can feel those sensors on the tips of nerves in his body getting triggered and passing the activations to his brain. He wonders why the human species even evolved such a system whose only use seems to be causing displeasure. But just like urination, there is so much more to the human species that he has to learn from scratch right now. And this must just be one of them that he has to adjust to and endure. He considers himself a quick learner.

Castiel starts learning about pain from the first minute he becomes a human, and that's something that never stops accompanying him.

"You okay there?" Dean glances at him sideways, frowning lightly. Cas has been shifting uncomfortably on the passenger seat for the past minutes.

They just finished the job with Rit Zien at Nora's, too busy cleaning up the body and bloodstains for the last few hours, covering all the supernatural traces. It was late in the night now, and they were both too exhausted to even sit straight.

Cas presses his back to the seat, holding his body stiffly steady. "Yes," he answers plainly.

"What's wrong?" Dean doesn't miss that wince on Cas's face when the car rolls over a small bump. His shoulders tighten when his back unavoidably rubs against the seat.

"Nothing," Cas insists.

Dean scrutinizes his stance and narrows his eyes. But he doesn't say anything.

And he doesn't drive Cas to the Gas N' Sip, either. Not yet.

"They only had doubles left," Dean simply says, pulling over to the motel parking lot. "So it's paid anyway. Figured maybe you don't mind sharing the room?" He looks up at Cas in a way a little too carefully, as if he's afraid Cas would say no.

Cas says, "Of course."

And Dean lets out a small, relieved breath. "Good," he says lightly, taking his duffel bag to the room.

Dean finds out the burning marks on Cas's back shortly after.

<br>

The sprained wrist is too sore and swollen to reach his back, and Cas can really use a good shower -- not like the gas station convenience shop's store room has a shower.

But he hesitates to ask Dean for help. Standing under a turned-off shower, feeling the lingering water dropping from his body slowly, gradually taking away the heat on his skin, Cas bites his tongue, wondering if it's a bad idea to call Dean in.

He almost jumps when Dean calls him first.

"Need any help in there?" Dean's worried voice passes through a slit opening in the bathroom door. "Just checking. I know it's always a pain in the ass after a hunt, with all the cuts and all that. You need any help, just ask."

He offers so openly, making Cas find it easy to say, "Actually, yes, it would be great if you could help clean my back."

"Sure thing," Dean answers easily, coming into the steaming bathroom.

Cas hears the shower curtain opening as he turns around, and he hears a small gasp from Dean. The movement behind him halts abruptly. He glances back quickly, finding Dean's eyes on his back. It takes him a second to remember what Dean must be seeing. What he almost forgets -- but never really could.

"What --" Dean's voice is broken, a little choked. He must have already known the answer before asking. He asks anyway, "-- what's that?" He shakes his head, changing his question, voice gentle and quiet, "Does it hurt?"

Cas has a general idea of what it must look like on his back -- he saw it from mirrors, but maybe it looks even worse to see straight ahead. He swallows. It's a mess.

Metatron had taken his grace and his wings away, but the Scribe didn't bother to do it too carefully. The opening on his throat was a rough cut -- hidden away from his casual angelic healing, and the opening at the root of his wings where they connect hyperdimensionally to the shoulder blades of his vessel -- that was way more nasty. Long gashes of black tears spread from little under his shoulder, stretching all the way down, covering a large part of his back. One on each side. Both of them are still deep red, almost close to blackened and charred, like fresh burning marks. The muscle and skin and recovery tissues from the human body worked diligently, trying to patch the gashes together, so the edges where the wings could have spread out from become a heavy layer of scar tissues, while the center of the wounds remains freshly open however much time passes -- it is a multidimensional gap in the center that couldn't be filled or fixed by anything on this plane. It is a visible proof that his connection to Heaven has been cut entirely. The meaning of the wounds pains him more than the physical sensation, though the latter has also never ceased.

Cas slumps his shoulders reflexively, almost reaching out to the shower curtain, trying to turn back and hide them away. "You don't have to..." he starts quickly, "Sorry, I forgot. I can wash myself just fine."

Dean stops his hand, holding the curtain open. A feather-light warm touch of finger ghosts over the very outer edge of his right shoulder blade. "It's the wings, isn't it?" he asks quietly.

Cas drops both arms by his sides slowly. "Yes," he answers, swallowing. He can't think of much else to say. He doesn't know if any human could even fully understand -- losing wings is like losing limbs, but could they -- could Dean -- imagine that? The loss of an arm? A leg? Losing the ability to fly as an angel, like humans losing the ability to run? Losing *all* the abilities that he's ever known for millions of years as an angel? He closes his eyes, hoping his brain stops bringing back the image of the Earth and Space when he looked down and watched over it for millions of years.

"I'm so sorry," Dean says, voice shaky. He starts to wipe his back carefully with a clean towel. His voice is so shattered that Cas thinks, when he stares at the brown tile of the shower room, that maybe Dean does understand.

"It does still hurt," Cas tells him, later, when they lie down on the motel beds in the late-night darkness. Cas sleeps on his left side, and Dean on his right. They can't quite see each other in the dimness, and their voices are muffled with half-unconscious sleepiness, but they are both too stubborn and idiotic to catch up on sleeping if it means they can steal a few more minutes to talk -- they'd part by morning, they both know. So even talks as small as "How are you" mean tremendously now, Cas thinks. He tells Dean about the burning sensations on the wounds, the aching emptiness in the center that feels like it can never be filled again, and he can never be complete again. Every night when he's between dream and sober, when he almost forgets if he's an angel or a human, the burning sensation feels like his wings are getting torn from the base right then and there, broken apart and taken away from him over and over again.

"Sometimes I forget I lost them," Cas says quietly, little more than a whisper. His eyes are already closed, and he can hear Dean's breath slowing down. He can see the light and color of his own wings in the darkness behind his eyelids, a memory that is almost like an unreal dream of a human, and it makes him so, so sad. "I would do that thing like straightening my shoulders as if I could still use them to fly. Then I remember."

There is a word for this, created by humans missing body parts, Castiel remembers, called "phantom limbs." He chews the word a few rounds on his tongue but decides it might not be a good idea to mention it to Dean, to burden him even more. It should be his own loss and pain to bear, especially when the Winchesters have the world to worry about. He doesn't need to trouble him.

The room falls so quiet and he can hear Dean's even breath. Cas isn't really sure if Dean's even heard that last part. It doesn't really matter. He sighs silently and whispers a "Good night".

And Dean's voice comes through just as quietly, as gently. "Cas?" Dean whispers, "We'll fix it. I promise. We'll have your wings back."

All Cas can think of to answer is just a quiet and sincere "Thank you." He doesn't even know if it's possible to fix after losing them -- it's never heard of for fallen angels -- but it's just so great to hear Dean say that, like the wing matter is important to him, like *he* is important to him. It already makes his heart light just to hear that.

Castiel falls asleep shortly after that, dreaming he's flying.

<br>

They don't really have much time to talk about the matter again after that. Dean has to go back to Sam, and Cas goes back to the convenience store.

Dean drops him off at the front of the store and looks at him with so much guilt in it that even Cas can read it. "Listen, Cas," the hunter says, biting his lower lip, "as soon as this is over, you move back in with us, you hear me? Now is just sorta an emergency kind of situation back home."

"You don't have to --" Cas starts.

"I want to." Dean cuts him off. "I'm sorry we can't now, but I want to, I really do." His eyes are almost pleading, almost glittering, saying everything from apologies to invites without words. Cas understands.

"Okay," he answers, agreeing quietly, "when this is over."

Cas gets some part of the Grace back before the "over" comes, whatever *this* is -- which usually means the end of the world and death of someone they know. He hates himself for tearing open the throat of a fellow angel to do that, knowing he's no better than Metatron, than Bartholomew, than Malachi -- he has to lower himself to the act of a barbarian to get ready, to fight, to protect the Winchesters, if the angels are going to bring war to them.

The borrowed grace doesn't do his body well, nor does it do to the wound of his wings. It's like connecting himself to the live electrical power grid. It burns him up like a wildfire starting from the empty crack in the gashes. He's forcing himself back to the league of angels when his body and vessel aren't prepared. The wounds are infecting, spreading and rotting under the burning of the unfitting grace, chewing away his life minute by minute before his own eyes. Even then, he can still feel the pain in the wings as if he still has them, the trembling ache from the tip to the root -- or it might just be the illusion from his body's fever.

Castiel lies on the motel bed, coughing and burning, knowing he's waning away fast. But the phone call from Sam wakes him up.

Dean's in trouble, he learns. Even worse, he's a demon, somehow, because of the Mark of Cain; he's not himself, and he needs Cas's help.

"I miss him," he tells Sam quietly. He misses him even more than he misses his wings, he realizes. Nowadays, he doesn't even have time to think about his Grace, his wings, his life, or where he'd end up going when all the pain and heat in his body finally gets the best of him. What's left of this life, Cas decides, he has to use it to find Dean, to save him.

He starts to drive toward Lebanon, Kansas.

The only time his mind wanders back to the pain on his shoulder blades is when he thinks, he used to be able to reach Dean so much faster when he still had wings. Any time Dean prayed to him, he could just be there, six inches away from him, wherever he was. He can't even hear Dean's prayer now, and he misses that so much, too.

<br>
<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">
<br>

"You know, I saw you, that night," Dean says suddenly, a little drunk.

It's a rare quiet night in the bunker. They've spent quite a lot of time searching for Darkness but found nothing. Sam decided it was an early night for him, and Dean asked Cas if he'd like to have some drinks and watch some TV together.

Cas thought he meant in the Dean Cave, on the sofa, but soon he found themselves sharing chips in Dean's room, on his bed. Which is nice.

The TV is idly playing some program that they both seem to pay only less than half attention to.

Cas turns to him at the words. "That night?" he prompts with a tilted head.

"That night when I almost killed Sammy with an axe last year, and you were there right on time to stop me." Dean's eyes swim around the room, flickering from the TV screen to Cas, then back to the beer bottle in his hand. He finishes the rest of the bottle in one pull and reaches for another by his bedstand. Empty glasses crowd there.

"Yes, I remember. I was there." Cas answers evenly, unsure of why he brought it up.

For some reason, that triggers a small grin at the tip of Dean's lips. He looks like he's going to laugh at a really funny joke Cas just made, but stops himself before the laugh can come through his throat. "No, I mean *I saw you*," Dean says slowly, stretching each word. "I saw the real you. You really have a halo."

Castiel is stunned. "How?" he stammers. "How's that possible -- oh."

"I was a demon, remember?" Dean actually laughs, but it's a bitter and pained one. The cruel, mocking smile crawls up his face like a poisonous vine. "Right when I was the ugliest, I saw you there, all light and color and beautiful, did I ever mention?"

Castiel stares at him, wordless. *You were not ugly*, he wants to say, *even when you were a demon, even when we met in Hell, you were never ugly.* But words fail him at that moment for some reason. He doesn't want to remind him of any of that, but Dean's the one continuing on that topic. Castiel swallows, having to gulp down some beer in his hand, just to have something to do, just to have the cool sensation wash down his throat even if he can't really enjoy or register the taste. The coolness reminds him of the constant, heated burning on his shoulder blades.

Dean's probably a little too drunk to notice his uneasiness at this moment, for he just glances over at Cas, looking him over with his dazed eyes, gesturing vaguely. "Even a demon brain knows what beauty is. I never saw anything more bright than you, more beautiful than you, more sad than you, Cas."

"Sad?" Cas can't help asking.

"Your wings." Dean blinks hard, as if trying to force his foggy brain to stay focused on Cas, on the conversation. "I can see the space where they should be, but they weren't there. I can see the emptiness they left behind, like a hole in the space, the blackness 'cause the missing of the color, the hollowness 'cause something so beautiful is lost. And I was so distracted by that, that's why the demon me couldn't continue fighting you guys."

Castiel parts his lips, swallows hard, and closes them again. There are no words. He doesn't even think Dean would be able to see. They haven't ever talked about his wings, ever since... ever since that day in the motel near the Gas N' Sip he was working for. He doesn't think Dean would even remember.

Dean looks at him expectantly. His eyes sweep over his head, behind his back, then circle back, landing on his face, his eyes, his lips.

"I didn't know," Cas murmurs, shifting his shoulders with too much self-consciousness for the first time in a long time under his gaze.

"Are they back now?" Dean wipes his eyes, just to look back at Cas again with less dizziness in them. He watches Cas closely, carefully. "I couldn't see them now, so you have to tell me."

Cas considers, then answers, trying to make it sound not too bad, "In a way, yes."

"Meaning?" Dean doesn't let go.

"I have my wings back, but they're broken, burned, and charred. I don't have much feathers left, either." Castiel bites his lower lip, then drops his eyes, whispering, "I don't think I'll ever fly again."

"Cas," Dean breathes out pained, reaching out to leave a hand on his shoulder, steadying him -- steadying himself, too, perhaps.

Castiel leans into the touch, and Dean ends up pulling him over into a hug.

The posture is awkward, but Cas rests his chin on Dean's shoulder, feeling his hands round his back, caressing right on the edge of his shoulder blades where the wounds were -- where the scars still are. Dean can probably still see them through the thin white T-shirt he's wearing now, borrowed from Dean's closet.

"Does it still hurt?" Dean's fingers trace the marks of the scars, from little under the shoulder all the way down to the small of his back. His breath brushes the tail of his hair.

Castiel closes his eyes, savoring the sensation. "Not as much as they used to be," he answers. *And they are so much better when Dean's fingers are tracing them through the thin fabric.*

Dean lets him go after long minutes. "What are they like?" he asks quietly. "I only ever saw the shadow. You never show me the whole thing." He almost pouts when he says that.

Castiel almost chuckles. "I would hate to burn your eyes out, Dean," he tells him gently. "Did you forget Pamela?"

"Oh," Dean says, scratching the back of his neck, "Right." A beat, then, "Still, she got to see you. I envy her for that. I'd never know."

Cas considers. "My wings," he says slowly, "they're part of me, just like arms and legs are part of the human body. The human mind would only be able to interpret them as light and colors, just like the rest of my true form. But they are huge. My Father created angels with the same dust and elements as the ones he used to create stars. So in a way, you may say we look like suns and stars."

Dean watches him like he's the most beautiful thing in the world, his eyes sparkling in awe. "That's beautiful," he whispers, voice choked. "I'm sorry."

Cas shakes his head lightly. "It's okay," he comforts Dean. "It's all past now." He has accepted the fate that he may never fly again.

Dean searches his eyes. "No," he says stubbornly, "it's not okay. You hate it."

Cas huffs a small, frustrated breath. He doesn't want to argue. Not tonight. "I'm getting used to it," he chooses to say.

"Still doesn't make it okay." Dean insists, "Not to you, not even to me. I promised we'll find a way to get your wings back. You don't believe me?"

Those green eyes staring at him are so loud and quiet at the same time, hot and soft, pained and tender. Those eyes are all so Dean.

Cas swallows. "I believe you, Dean. I always do."

He smiles small, genuine.

Dean smiles back, almost happy.

They finish the beers and the TV, and crash into bed. Cas doesn't bother to return to his own room.

<br>
<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">
<br>

The rest of that year is flushed to toilet, and Castiel's memory is hazed like a crumpled spitball being ridden by the Devil.

The next time they get the slightest chance of a breath is after Satan bails on the body of Vince Vincente, and they just couldn't save the old rock star or anyone in his band. They watch the ambulance and police carrying away the bodies, and the fans crying and mourning at the loss.

Dean suggests they take a day off, just to get some rest from that big fight with Lucifer before heading back to the bunker. Sam and Cas don't have a second opinion.

Cas is just planning to spend the day holed up in the motel room when Dean comes to ask if he wants to take a walk together, wandering around the city. They don't usually get much chance to visit big cities anyway.

Cas puts on the trench coat and follows him out.

Los Angeles is still warm and comfortable even in early November. They walk down the streets with beautiful museum and gallery architectures, and old book stores -- one of them claiming to be "The Last Bookstore" that would ever exist in a post-apocalypse world. They have to go inside to take a look.

"They wouldn't stand a chance in the Apocalypse," Cas whispers in Dean's ear when they amble between the shelves. Books are piled and stocked high on each shelf. The place has a light, pleasant smell of musk and old book pages. Cas's fingers roam over the book ridges. Dean watches him from a step behind.

"I don't think that's the meaning of the name," Dean mumbles back.

Cas hums quietly.

"I'm glad we stopped the Apocalypse," he says after a short moment, "so places like this can continue to exist."

Dean nods in agreement.

The place is quiet with a faint tune of melodic music without vocals and the low white noise of people whispering. It almost looks holy, just from the right lighting, the books, the music, and the people in here -- it might as well be a church made of books.

Cas lingers between the shelves and books for a large chunk of hours. Dean follows him around, glancing curiously at the books near them, skimming the titles.

The air and silence between them are easy, comfortable.

When they finally drag themselves out of the bookstore, the noon sun is high in the sky. Dean's excitement overflows when they find a grand food market just barely two blocks away, where he finds all kinds of pizza and taco and pie.

He takes more than he can eat, and even succeeds in persuading Cas to eat them with him.

"You like this city," Cas observes.

"You don't?" Dean raises an eyebrow slightly, halfway devouring a slice of apple pie.

Cas shrugs slightly. "I don't have a strong opinion one way or another."

Dean gives him a wink. "Think again after we see 'The Good Place'."

"'The Good Place'?" Cas parrots.

Dean wipes his mouth with a mysterious grin. "Come on." He leads the way out, "It's just around the corner."

Cas watches him curiously.

It's a short walk. The buildings around them transform from skyscrapers to low-rise flats, no more than two to three stories tall, aged with a sense of time, almost as if they were walking back in a walk of time.

Dean's steps are dedicated to one direction, following the street. His eyes focused.

"You know where to go," Cas watches him. "Did you plan this trip?"

Dean licks his lips. "Just follow me," he says simply.

And then, turning sharply around the corner of the street, Dean spreads his arms with a bright smile and glittering eyes. He announces, "Surprise!"

Castiel turns around the corner, gasping quietly. There, murals with astonishingly beautiful and bright colors flowering on the walls, as if the palette of the rainbow is tipped over, pouring all the way from sky to this little alleyway in this town. They are lively and marvelous, colors flourishing on the brick and concrete as if they have a life of their own.

Cas follows the wall and appreciates the art with widened eyes, until he stops dead at one particular piece of art. His step freezes. So is his gaze.

His eyes trace the pattern on the art, and his fingers follow his eyes.

He forgets to breathe.

"Welcome to the City of Angels, *Angel*," Dean says quietly behind him.

Cas jumps, almost forgetting him completely. He turns sharply, meeting Dean's eyes. His voice is quivering when he blurts out, "Is this why you brought me here?"

Behind him, a gigantic angel wing mural spread out over the whole wall, starting right across his shoulders. They have the color of the sun and the stars; they glisten under the afternoon sunlight as if they shine with angelic power and grace. They are astoundingly wonderful, and they remind him too much of his wings. His eyes start gathering wetness.

Dean watches him closely, the shining lights in his eyes shift from mischief to expectant, then sharply to panic. "Yes," he admits hurriedly, breathless, "yes, Cas. I saw them online, thought they're beautiful, they remind me of you. Thought you'd like it..."

He takes a step forward, standing right before Cas, half a foot away. He raises his hands, but stops himself when his fingers are inches away from Cas's cheeks; he leaves them on his shoulders. "Does it... does it hurt too much? I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking... I'm sorry. It's such a bad idea. I shouldn't... I'm sorry..."

Cas pulls him into a hug without a word. Over Dean's shoulder, there is a quiet sob. "Thank you," he whispers, words broken. He says it again and again. "Thank you. Thank you." He can't form a different word except for that. Maybe there is another one, three words, maybe he can say that too. Some day.

Dean's racing heart steadies down in that embrace. His arms hold the angel tight. So tight that he can't breathe, neither of them can.

The root of the angel wing mural is right behind the angel's back, where the wings are, where the wings should have been.

<br>
<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">
<br>

Dean has a frown on his face and a pen and a notebook by his hand, the laptop screen flashing luminescent light on his face, when Cas walks into the bunker library.

Seeing his look, Cas is immediately tense. "Is there a case?"

Dean looks up from the screen, the furrow between his eyebrows unfolding slightly. "Not that I can see."

"Anything from your mother, then?" Cas walks closer slowly.

"No, why?" Dean raises his eyebrows.

Cas frowns slightly. "I see the look on your face," he notes. "You are only this serious when you're researching something important. So it's either British Man of Letters or Lucifer's son, at this point."

Dean huffs out a small laugh, turning the laptop screen to him. "You're right about 'something important' there."

His screen searching bar reads: "How to fix an angel's wings."

Cas blinks, his shoulders slumping. "That's --" he pauses to think about the best way to phrase it, "-- hardly the highest priority problem we have right now, don't you think?"

Dean narrows his eyes. "I disagree. Cas, when's the last time you got to fly somewhere? With your own wings?"

Cas tilts his head to think. Dean speaks before he finds the answer, "Four years! Cas, you lost your wings for four damn years! I don't see a damn other thing can be any higher priority than that! I can whine for a whole week if I break my legs or strain my shoulders. I'll be damned if I just sit here not doing anything to --" he swallows, gesturing vaguely but frantically with his hands at Cas's back, "-- you know, get you in the air again."

Cas restrains himself not to correcting him that flying with angel wings is not flying in the air, it's in a multidimension. He lowers his eyes instead, flitting from Dean's eyes to his lips, landing on the notes he was taking. He asks softly, "What did you find?"

Dean's attention shifts to the notes, too, pointing out the first few lines of ideas, though both have a question mark right by their side. "What do you think we ask for some outside help? Maybe Rowena knows some strong healing spells? Or do you think the Brits might have something up their sleeves?"

Cas considers.

That's when Sam darts into the room, breaking the silence, "So get this -- I think I found something..."

Dean and Cas jerk their heads up, meeting each other's eyes. Dean gives him a deeply apologetic, pained look, and Cas returns with a similar bitter one. He asks, without breaking their stare, "What is it?"

Dean closes his eyes, letting out a long sigh.

<br>
<hr style="border: 1.5px solid; color: #36165a; opacity: 0.8;">
<br>

Cas finds him in the kitchen, alone, drinking, way past midnight, on the first night after he came back. From the Empty.

Dean sinks into the chair, left hand holding a glass of beer, right hand tightly holding a small piece of paper.

Cas makes sure his footsteps are heard before walking into the kitchen.

Dean looks up at him with red-rimmed eyes. He lets the photo fall onto the table.

It's the photo they took in Los Angeles, Cas realizes, before that angel wing wall. He doesn't know Dean printed it out. The edge of the picture is crinkled, the folding line weary in the middle.

He can see the tears in his eyes and the silhouette of a real, happy smile on the tip of his own lips from that photo. He remembers that day as clear as day. And from the look on Dean's face, he does, too.

But that can't be the reason why Dean is looking at the photo -- looking at him -- with *that* look, is it?

Cas sits in the closest chair by his side, folding his hands together. He wonders what he should say. They haven't seen each other for six months, and it feels as far as across the galaxy, across a whole dimension -- it might really be, considering he has *died* for six months.

"Cas?" Dean's the one who breaks the silence. His voice wrecked, his lips trembling. He keeps his eyes on Cas's hands, as if he's afraid that if he looks up, if he really looks, Cas won't be there again. "You're really back? Not my damn dream fooling me again? It's killing me to see you every time, and to wake up to know you're gone."

Cas has to take a deep breath. He leans in, cupping Dean's cheeks with his palms, making him look at him. "I'm here, Dean. I'm real."

Dean grabs his wrist, pressing his face harder into the touch. His breath is completely shattered, choking with tears. "I saw the wing marks, Cas. I saw it. All the other times you were gone, I thought, if your wings weren't burned, maybe you were fine, you could still come back. And every time, you did. But this time is different."

He can't continue; the sobbing makes his whole body tremble. Cas holds him tightly, letting his head rest on his shoulder, soothing his back with his hands. He shushes him quietly and murmurs nonstoppingly, "I'm here now."

Dean grasps Cas's arms desperately like a drowning man, and painfully slowly, he quiets down. Cas's hands are still caressing Dean's back, just like all those years ago when Dean did the same for him.

"Every day I look at that picture, and I think about your big beautiful wings made of lights and color that I've never seen before." When Dean is finally capable of saying a full sentence again, he says. "And every day I see your body fall before me, your wings burned to the ground, without even having it back again. And I tell myself, that's the one thing I'd never forgive myself."

"Dean --" Cas can't help but start.

"Did Sam tell you I almost died right before you came back?" Dean asks quietly. "That I actually died? For about ten minutes?"

Cas clutches his jaw. "It seems to be a bad habit of ours," he tells him solemnly.

And Dean laughs. He cracks up, and he laughs as if it's the funniest joke in the world. "Yeah," he wipes the tears away that come from laughing too hard. "Yeah, it really is. We really should stop doing that now."

Cas pulls apart slightly and studies his face carefully. Tears of joy and desperation still hang on his cheeks. Dean's eyes flicker everywhere, as if he wants nothing more than staring at Cas, and at the same time, the very same action scares the life out of him.

"Dean, it's not your fault that my wings are broken. You've been doing nothing but help me," Cas says gently.

Dean looks at him, drinking in the view of his face. "Are they fixed now? Now that you are... you know, alive?" he asks hopefully.

Cas shakes his head slightly, eyes dropping. "The Empty isn't that kind."

"Not a charity, I see," Dean nods shortly, finally composed, quietly sliding the photo back into his wallet where it belongs. "Back on top of my To-Fix list, then."

Cas just watches him and answers quietly, "Okay." It's a long shot, but he knows now Dean would do anything to at least do this one thing for him. And he's going to let him.

For some reason, it surprises Dean. "What, not going to say 'it's not that important'?" Dean amuses.

Cas raises his eyebrows. "Did we just swap our lines?"

Dean considers momentarily and curls his lips. "Yeah, think we just did. Something happened in the Empty?"

"A lot," Cas says. And in Dean's querying eyes, he tells him the whole conversation he had with the big Shadow Cosmic Entity that shares the same face.

"He said, he knew all my memories, all my little feelings; what I hate, who I love, and what I fear," Cas pauses there, wondering if he can be bold enough to spell out the truth. He meets Dean's eyes then, and the look in those amber green eyes shatters him inside out.

There are never any eyes that can speak more words than those of Dean's; there is never another moment in his long life that Cas has ever seen anything more emotional, more wordless, more full. That's all the fear, hope, cherish, fondness, warmth, worry, and so, so much more in there. He can't even imagine how a human can even contain that much emotion without exploding. Cas looks into those eyes and thinks, maybe that's exactly why he exploded.

Dean licks his lips. "Who you love," he repeats, evenly, steadily, slowly. Not a question.

His eyes are not blinking.

"Yes," Cas says frankly. Also not blinking. The emotions in those eyes of Dean's are shifting, more hope, and more fear; more gentle, and more worry. The color and light swirl in there like the most turbulent wave in a seaquake.

"You."

Dean starts breathing again, loudly. And he starts laughing again, until there are tears streaming down, like he's broken and complete at the same time.

Cas watches him with a small smile, waiting for him patiently, until he can't hold it back but to ask, "Are you going to say anything back?"

Dean looks at him like he's an unbelievable, miraculous thing that has ever existed. "Oh God," he catches his breath, gushing out, "Yes, yes, of course, Cas. God. I love you. I love you so much it's killing me. You can't imagine. Why else do you think I want to fix your wings so damn hard? Or I can't barely survive six months every time I thought I lost you?"

Cas has to pull him into a tight hug again, just to steady himself from the dazed feeling rushing through him, brushing him like the most ruthless yet gentle waves. Pain is never the strongest sensation ever since he started picking up human experience, he realizes. Love is so much stronger, so much sharper and more acute, so much stronger, physically, mentally, in every aspect, in every form of his. It overwhelms him. And from the shiver in the body attached to him, he knows it's the same with Dean. And that's the best part.

He feels so full and complete now for the first time. It doesn't seem to even matter that much that his wings are still broken, that the scars are still spreading dreadfully across his back, that the lingering sensation of pain is still there. It doesn't matter, because he knows Dean and he will try their best to find a solution, just as hard as if it's another end-of-the-world to save. It doesn't matter, because even if they couldn't, even if there isn't a solution, he still has faith, that one day the true paradise will fall. And on that day, he will stretch out his new and blessed wings, and he will greet Dean like it's the first and last time they meet. On that day, Dean will widen his eyes, because for the first time in his life, he will be able to see all the lights and colors on his wings. Even when he long knew they were beautiful, this will be the first time, that he's still surprised and awed to see it. And Castiel thinks, he will very much enjoy that day, just like that day when Dean led him through the little alleyways under the sun of Los Angeles and told him:

"Welcome to the City of Angels, *Angel*."

Castiel has already decided, long before it's due, that he will use that very sentence to welcome Dean when the right time comes.

For now, they have all the time on Earth, until they can have all the time in eternity, together.

Taking a deep breath, closing his eyes, tightening his arms around the love of his life, Castiel straightens his shoulders. He can feel the sense of safety, love, freedom, and happiness right this moment. He's flying already, without needing his wings.
