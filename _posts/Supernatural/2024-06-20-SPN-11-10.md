> Crowley: You're dead!
>
> Rowena: Please Fergus, enough with idle threats.
>
> Crowley grabs Rowena around the neck, choking her.
>
> Crowley: You betrayed me, in my kingdom.
>
> Rowena: (gasping) <u>Not yours! His! Hell is his! I'm his. So hurt me and what do you think he'll do to you?</u>
>
> Crowley: Lucifer will never get out of that cell.
>
> Rowena: (barely able to breathe) You're willing to stake your life on that? On Sam Winchester?
>
> Crowley releases his hold on her; Rowena gasps and coughs.
>
> Crowley: How long? How long have you been working for him?
>
> Rowena: Not long, Lucifer came to me in a dream... (Crowley turns to look at Rowena and she smirks)... Not that kind of dream.
>
> Crowley: So you're just gonna let the big strong man boss you around? Whatever happened to the super-duper awesome coven #girlpower?
>
> Rowena: Lucifer is no man. He's perfection. Why do you think I let your droogs find me? Lucifer has a plan and...
>
> Crowley: And, he's the devil.
>
> Rowena: You say that like it's a bad thing.
>
> Crowley: Oh, I'm a bad thing. He's a worse thing. Last time Lucifer went topside you know what he wanted? (Rowena smiles at the question) Death. For you. For me. And every human. And every demon.
>
> Rowena: He's changed.
>
> Crowley: Oh yes, of course. All he needed was the love of a horrible woman. So... and you're doing all this... why? Out of the goodness of your heart?
>
> Rowena: Don't you be daft. After Lucifer stops the Darkness, he'll ascend to his throne... in Heaven and I'll be by his side, a loyal follower.
>
> Crowley: A queen?
>
> Rowena: Like it or not, you know I'm right. Lucifer fought the Darkness before and he won. (Rowena stands up and glares at Crowley, angry) So... unless you've got the almighty in your back pocket, I suggest you sit down, shut up and let him work.

> Dean drives the impala down a road. He tries to call Sam.
>
> Dean: (on Sam's voicemail) Hey, Sam can't talk right now because he's waxing... like everything. But leave a message.
>
> Sam: (on Sam's voicemail) Dean, what are you doing with my phone? Dean, come on.
>
> Dean: Call me! Now!
>
> Dean hangs up and tries to call Crowley on 666.
>
> Crowley: (on his voicemail) Thank you for phoning Crowley, King of Hell. For demon deals press one. To report a sighting of that ginger whore Rowena, press two.
>
> Dean hangs up because he is experiencing blurred vision. He starts to gag and pulls the car to the side of the road, barely getting out of the car in time to throw up. He falls down, leans against the impala and is sick again. He hears a voice.
>
> Castiel: Dean?
>
> He looks around and sees Castiel approaching. His vision is still blurry.
>
> Castiel: <u>I came as soon as you called. Are you alright?</u>
>
> Dean: (looking sick) Cass?
>
> Dean is sick again. Castiel puts his hand on Dean's shoulder, as Dean groans and sits back up.
>
> Castiel: You're not alright.
>
> Dean: (wiping his mouth with his jacket's sleeve) Obviously. What's wrong with me?
>
> <u>Castiel places his hand on Dean's forehead and then looks into his eyes.</u>
>
> Dean: What are you doing?
>
> Castiel: <u>Stick out your tongue.</u>
>
> Dean: What?
>
> <u>Dean opens his mouth and Castiel peers inside, diagnosing him.</u>
>
> Dean: Alright, are we done?
>
> Castiel: No. <u>(Castiel looks worried and holds up his finger) Let me take your temperature.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>(looking startled, pushing Castiel's finger away) No... that's not going to happen.</u>
>
> Castiel: How far are we from the event?
>
> Dean: You mean the angel nuke?
>
> Castiel: Yeah.
>
> Dean: Ground zero is about a mile down that way.
>
> Castiel: That explains it. You're suffering from smiting sickness.
>
> Dean: (in disbelief) That... that's a thing?

> By the time Castiel reaches them, Amara is consuming Ambriel's grace. Ambriel falls to the ground, dead. Amara looks skyward and the darkness from the forest and sky is slowly sucked back into Amara. It is daylight again and Amara seems to be re-charged. She looks towards Castiel.
>
> Amara: Castiel?
>
> Castiel: Amara, what did you do to her?
>
> Amara: I consumed her. Her grace, her spark, her memories, everything... she... oh, she really hit the spot.
>
> Castiel gets out his angel blade and Amara is amused.
>
> Amara: Seriously? I mean Heaven brought the thunder and it barely even scratched my paint job. But you and a shiny knife, sure, that's gonna work.
>
> Castiel: <u>You think I'm afraid to die?</u>
>
> Amara: I know you are. <u>You reek of fear and self loathing.</u>
>
> Castiel raises the blade to strike and Amara stops him by grabbing his arm.
>
> Amara: Oh, scary.
>
> Amara flings Castiel against a tree and he falls to the ground.
>
> Amara: She's right you know, you are expendable and weak. <u>And why God took a special interest in you, I'll never understand.</u> My brother always did have horrible taste in men.
>
> Castiel: <u>Just do it.</u>
>
> Amara brushes her hand against Castiel's cheek.
>
> Amara: <u>Blue eyes, you're not even worth the effort... and no offence, but you look a bit used up.</u> Plus, I have a job for you.
>
> Amara puts her hand on Castiel's chest and Castiel screams as he is sent away in a blinding flash of light. Amara stands up, but then staggers, as though she's suddenly lost her energy. She looks anxious, as she leans against a tree for support.

> Lucifer: No wait, here's my personal favorite, is you doing every stupid thing you could to cure the Mark, even after you knew it would go bad.
>
> Sam: (angry) My brother was dying!
>
> Lucifer: Yes! <u>And you'd do anything to save him. And he'd do anything to save you.</u> And that is the problem. Because of this (Lucifer points to Past Sam and Amelia)... you're so overcome by guilt that <u>you can't stand to lose Dean again and he could never lose you</u>, and so <u>instead of choosing the world you choose each other, no matter how many innocent people die</u>.
>
> Sam: (angry) You're going to lecture me about hurting people? You?
>
> Lucifer: You know I'm right Sam. You know it! And I know if you're going to beat the Darkness you have to be ready to die. You have to be ready to watch the people you love die. A long time ago you could have fought the good fight kid, but not anymore. You can't win this one Sam. You're just not strong enough.
>
> Sam: And you are?
>
> Lucifer: Hey, snappin' necks and cashin' checks is what I do.

> Sam: (quietly) No. No.
>
> Lucifer: (angry) What do you mean no?
>
> Sam: You heard me.
>
> Lucifer: Okay, now Sam, I gotta tell you, this is selfish, man, everything...
>
> Sam: You are done. It's over.
>
> Sam stands up and walks towards Lucifer.
>
> Sam: You know what? You talk a good game. You do. Hell, you almost had me sold a few times. But then I thought what if you're right? What if you're telling the truth? What if you can beat her?
>
> Lucifer: (yelling) I can!
>
> Sam: Even though the last time it took you, plus three other archangels. Oh yeah, and capital G, God.
>
> Lucifer: Oh okay, what, you mean the dead weight?
>
> Sam: Well, let's say you gank her... then what?
>
> Lucifer: (shrugging) <u>I move to LA... solve crimes.</u>
>
> Sam: Wrong. Then you go about starting the Apocalypse, again, because you're an old dog and that's your old trick.
>
> Lucifer: Okay, first off, you don't know that. Second, even if I did that's better than what she has planned.
>
> Sam: Is it? Really? 'Cause this is what I think, I think that whoever wins, you or the Darkness, everyone else loses. So, no. My answer is no. <u>This isn't because of Dean, or the past, this is about me having faith in my friends, having faith in my family.</u> We will find a way. <u>I'm ready to die and I'm ready to watch people I love die, but I'm not ready to be your bitch.</u>

PPS: Rowena的真情表露

> Crowley: Mother, why do you hate me?
>
> Rowena: <u>I hate you, because when I look into your eyes I see the woman I used to be, before magic, before the coven... when I was nothing but Rowena, the tanner's daughter... a pale, scared little girl, who smelled of filth and death. (Rowena starts to massage Crowley's shoulders) I hate you, because when you were born, your father said he loved me, then he went back to his grand wife and his grand house, whilst I lay pathetic and half dead on a straw mat... my thighs slick with blood. (Rowena bends down so that she is talking right into Crowley's ear, tears spilling) I hate you, because if I didn't, I'd love you. But love... love is weakness. And I'll never be weak again.</u>
>
> Crowley has tears in his eyes too. But then they are both startled by the banging of a door. Castiel enters the room.

P3S: 彩蛋：

> Billie is reading a comic book - Death: The Time of Your Life by Neil Gaiman.
