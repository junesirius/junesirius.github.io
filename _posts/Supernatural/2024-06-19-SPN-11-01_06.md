> Cop cars and a big truck pull up. The camera pans back to show Castiel hiding in the trees. He gets down on his knees.
>
> Castiel: Brothers, sisters... I know I have no right, I have no standing to ask you -- you anything, but these are desperate times, so ask I must. <u>I confess my transgressions, and I will accept whatever punishment you dole out.</u> Now, I... I ask you to help me. Please. <u>Save me from doing worse.</u>

> Dean: Where the hell are you, Cass?
>
> The scene flips between Sam and Dean at the hospital, and Castiel in the woods.
>
> Castiel: I'm... I'm okay.
>
> Dean: You don't sound okay.
>
> Castiel: Dean, I am fine. Besides, what I have, you can't help me.
>
> Dean: What do you mean, what you have?
>
> Castiel: Just please tell Sam -- Rowena escaped with the Book of the Damned and the codex.
>
> Dean: Okay, forget Rowena. Where are you?
>
> Castiel: <u>Now, you tell me -- the Mark...</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Oh, really? You're worried about me after everything that I've --</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Dean, is it gone?</u>
>
> Dean: Yes. I'm good. I mean, I'm not great.
>
> Castiel: Makes two of us. (Dean puts Cass on speakerphone) This is good news.
>
> Sam: Hey, Cass.
>
> Castiel: Sam.
>
> Dean: Okay, your turn. Talk to us about the darkness.
>
> Castiel: Why would I talk about the darkness?
>
> Sam: Because it's free.
>
> Castiel: No, that can't be.
>
> Sam: Removing the Mark opened some kind of lock. Dean saw her.
>
> Castiel: The darkness is a woman?
>
> Dean: Well, that's what we're asking you. We were hoping you could tell us what kind of defcon screwed we are.
>
> Dean: Cass?
>
> Castiel: (pauses at a sound in the woods behind him) <u>Sam, Dean... Goodbye. It may be some time before we see one another again.</u>
>
> Dean: Wait, Cass. Cass!

> *Int. Dungeon Room - Day*

> Jonah and Efram are torturing Castiel. He screams as they cut him apart with angel blades.
>
> EFRAM: Where's Metatron?
>
> Castiel: I don't know.
>
> Efram: Where's Metatron, Castiel?
>
> Castiel: Mercy, brother, please!
>
> Efram: Brother? Ha! What are you?
>
> Castiel: W-what? I'm an angel of the Lord.
>
> Efram: That so? <u>'Cause, near as I can tell, when you have to choose between heaven and the Winchesters...</u>
>
> Jonah: <u>You choose them.</u>
>
> Efram: <u>Every time.</u> So, see, you're not my brother. And if I had it my way, I'd take this blade, stick it in your heart... and call that a damn good day.
>
> Castiel: <u>Then do it!</u>
>
> Efram: Nah. The fun's just getting started.
>
> Castiel: No!

> Castiel: I feel the spell just cutting deeper and deeper, and I'm trying to fight it. I'm trying, but --

> Hannah: Where is it?
>
> Castiel: I don't know.
>
> Hannah: Then who would? The Winchesters? Castiel, if this is true, it's the end for all of us. Sam and Dean -- where are they?
>
> Castiel: I don't know.
>
> Hannah: Then think harder!
>
> Castiel: How did you find me?
>
> Hannah: I saved you.
>
> Castiel: No. I don't think you did. I think that you told Efram and Jonah to bring me here and to hurt me, and so you arranged to -- to... to burst in and save me. You were hoping that I would be so grateful that I would do anything you said, that I would tell you anything that you wanted to know. <u>Why, Hannah? We were friends.</u>
>
> Hannah: That was before you freed Metatron... Before... The other angels, they hate you.
>
> Castiel: And what about you? Do you hate me?
>
> Efram: (both Efram and Jonah enter the room again) It doesn't matter. We took a vote -- democracy in action -- and... Hannah's doing the job.
>
> Castiel: <u>I won't give you Sam and Dean.</u>

> *INT. LIBRARY, BUNKER - DAY*
>
> Sam and Dean are leaning over Castiel who has fallen out of his Chair from the effects of Rowena's spell.
>
> Sam: Cass? Hey. Are you okay?
>
> Castiel: Relative to what?
>
> Dean: <u>You know where you are? What's the date?</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>Earth. Several billion years from the beginning.</u>
>
> Dean: Come on, buddy. Come on.
>
> Castiel: <u>It's like I was... inside a blender that was set to purée for a tomato salsa.</u>
>
> Dean: And you're the tomato?
>
> Castiel: In this analogy, yes.
>
> Dean: Yeah.
>
> Sam: Cass, what was that? <u>You scared the crap out of us.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>I blacked out for a lot of it. But I... I don't know. It overwhelmed me. I-I couldn't control it.</u>
>
> Dean: <u>Let's get him up. Come on, come on. Here you go. We gotta find that witch.</u>
>
> Sam: Yeah.
>
> Castiel: What can I do to help?
>
> Sam: <u>No, no, no, you just, uh, sit there and take a breather, try and put yourself back together.</u>
>
> Castiel: Okay. I'll do my best. It's... It's difficult with these voices.
>
> Sam: Now there are voices?
>
> Dean: <u>Are these voices telling you to hurt someone?</u>
>
> Castiel: No. Guys, I'm -- I'm hearing Angel radio. It's a lot of chatter. They're... They've been looking for me ever since I escaped, as well as scouring the earth for the perp. It's slang for "perpetrator".
>
> Dean: Ah.
>
> Sam: Yeah, thank you. Um, a-any... "perp" in particular?
>
> Castiel: Metatron. They're doubling the effort to find him, so... If we need to get hold of him, we better do it soon.
>
> Dean: Yeah, before the God squad does.

> Dean: <u>Cass! Cass! Don't do this. Okay, this isn't you. It's the spell. You can beat this. Cass... Let her go.</u> Go! Go, go, go. <u>Hey. Okay, okay. It's gonna be okay, buddy, all right? Uhh!</u>

>
> Castiel: <u>Dean, I... There aren't words.</u>

> Dean: <u>You're right. There aren't words, Cass, 'cause there's no need. You were under a spell. It's fine.</u>
>
> Castiel: Yeah, but you had Rowena. Because of me, you...
>
> Sam: You know, Cass, we've got the codex. That's a start. You know, it'll slow Rowena down some. If we'd killed her, the Book of the Damned would've been lost.
>
> Dean: Besides, we got bigger fish to fry.
>
> Castiel: The Darkness. What does she want?
>
> Dean: Well, the big question is, where the hell is she?
>
> Castiel: (gesturing toward deans injuries) Dean, I can fix that.
>
> Dean: No, no, no. No, no. It's fine, Cass. <u>Besides, I had it comin'.</u>

> Castiel is sitting in a chair next to a bed in the bunker. A phone is ringing. Castiel answers the phone.
>
> Castiel: Hi.
>
> Dean: Cass. How you doing, buddy?
>
> Switch to view of a TV screen with a female talk show host holding a microphone. The caption on the screen is of the "Jenny Jones" talk show titled "DNA Tests Prove Fatherhood".
>
> Jenny Jones: We did a DNA test on Louis.
>
> Castiel: (looking tired) Oh, I'm fine.
>
> Dean: Find anything on Metatron?
>
> Castiel: Um, nothing on angel radio.
>
> Dean: <u>How long's it been since you left the bunker?</u>
>
> Castiel: Oh, why would I leave? I've got everything I need right here.
>
> Dean: Wait. Is that -- are you watching "Jenny Jones"?
>
> Castiel: It's a rerun. (Dean rolls his eyes and looks exasperated) She's just about to announce the paternity results.
>
> Jenny Jones: You are the father.
>
> Castiel: (rolls his eyes and looks exasperated) Jenny, he is not ready to be a father.
>
> Dean: <u>Okay. I-I-I thought you were going with socially acceptable binge watching.</u> Uh, you know, "The Wire," "Game of Thrones."
>
> Castiel: Yeah, well, a man can't live on caviar alone, Dean.
>
> Dean: Well, you sound weird, okay? Bad weird. Now, I've been down this road before. I have heard the siren's song from the idiot box, and <u>I'm telling you, whatever you're looking for, you won't find it in there. So do me a favor. Turn off the TV. Go outside and get some air.</u> We're in the dark here, pal. I need you back in the game, okay?
>
> Castiel sighs as Dean hangs up. Dean looks at his phone, shakes his head and walks towards Sam who is on his phone.

> Cut to Cass lying in bed, in his suit, watching TV and then back to the TV screen. We see a newswoman sitting in front of a city skyline backdrop with "OWW 2 News" in the lower right hand corner.
>
> NEWSWOMAN: (smiling) Ah, that dog thinks it's people.
>
> Cut back to Cass lying in bed, smiling.
>
> Cut to the TV screen showing a video of two men fighting in an alley. People are yelling and then one man takes out a gun and shoots the other. The news camera pulls back and a white van comes into view. An image of a person is seen the reflection of the van's side view mirror. At this, Cass's expressions turns serious.
>
> Cass stands up with the TV remote in his hand and pauses the show and walks towards the TV. As he gets closer, he rewinds the program and freezes the screen on the image in the mirror. The camera alternately zooms in on Cass's face and the image. Cass's expression goes from puzzled to surprised as the image is revealed to be Metatron holding a video camera.

> Castiel: (walking closer towards Metatron) What do you know about the Darkness?
>
> Metatron: The band? (Castiel steps closer) Okay. Uh...Sometimes during late-night writing sessions, when God was deep in his cups, he may have let slip a few choice words. But... I don't have to tell you anything.
>
> Castiel: Are you forgetting? (Castiel grabs Metatron by the collar and slams him against a cabinet, menacingly) You are human now, and I could crush you like a bug.
>
> Metatron: Could, but you won't. You think I didn't notice? <u>You are broken, Castiel. You were always a bit of a Nancy, but this? (Castiel drops his hands from Metatron's collar) You have gone full wuss. I don't know what it was that happened, but whatever it was, you are scarred... deep, paralyzed by trauma, by fear.</u>
>
> Castiel looks unsure.
>
> Metatron: (scoffing) I mean, look at you. You can't even hit me! (Castiel punches Metatron in the face) Oh!
>
> Castiel: (grabbing Metatron by the collar again) <u>It's not fear.</u>
>
> Castiel punches Metatron in the face again and throws him through/against a glass cabinet.

> Crowley picks up the Demon blade and 'hefts' it in his hand.
>
> Crowley: <u>Do you know how disturbing it was to realize that I couldn't bring myself to kill you? I've had tons of chances over the years, some you don't even know about, but, still... I made my peace with it, embraced my softer side, learned to accept that there was just too much going on between you and I -- bromance.</u>
>
> Dean's eyes widen in surprise.
>
> Crowley: But you know what? I think I am gonna kill you today.
>
> Crowley points with the knife for emphasis.
>
> Crowley: I feel different somehow, ready. What can I say? Fatherhood changes a man.
