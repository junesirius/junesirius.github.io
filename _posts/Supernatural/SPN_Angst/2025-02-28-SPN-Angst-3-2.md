The world is a pool of shapes and colors, floating and swimming, emerging and diverging. Some shapes and colors move closer, some further. Some red and its approach burns, some black and tearing and cold, the others vague and grey, passing by without extra sensation.

There is no thought, no words. Light or dark, chromatic or bleak. That's all there is.

It takes a while to realize the small blinking lights are edible, and those feel good -- making the colors looking brighter and shapes sharper. Almost like the view is getting clearer, but still the same forms.

It takes a longer while to realize those lights are souls, and absorbing them can bring strength back, making wounds heal -- even just slightly.

Castiel wanders in the land, fumbling, searching. Not knowing where he is, not knowing where he's heading.

He opens his mouth, growls echoing as the vocal cords vibrates. He sinks teeth, blood seeping out from the things in his bite, twitching the body, then not moving. The light that rested inside of it shifts and moves along with the blood, moving into him. He swallows them, then moves away.

The creatures and monsters crowd around this place like rabbits in the summer prairie. Led by instincts, he hunts and eats and moves, chasing one sparkling light to another, knowing all of them are nothing more than food and source of strength.

And then he sees it. In the center of the opening, the brightest light shades everything else, dulling up all the other creatures. The light of the soul that is like the beacon on the sea, the North Star of the starry sky, the crackling burning fire in the polar night, the Sun in the dark space. It's so bright that the lumination and heat almost scorch him from this distance.

But he steps towards it. He can't stop staring it and he can't stop himself from moving towards it. The bright, the light, the heat, the beacon. The center of the universe is there. The brightest soul that he's ever seen.

Even without the clear view, even without the clear mind with all the past memory and knowledge, he would know this is what he's looking for -- even if he doesn't remember what it is, or what himself is.

He approaches, the attraction uncontrollable, but also unavoidably intimated. The intensity and the heat, the light itself, the soul that is so strong, it appeals to him and terrifies him in the same way wild animals getting attracted and frightened by the camper's bonfire in the same time.

Castiel circles around the light, hiding himself in the woods, letting the shadow cover his trace. Tempted, but intimated. Staying in the place where he can see it, but not close enough to be seen.

Days and nights pass, he hunts and eats and devours and waits. The power from the souls of the small creatures and monsters accumulates, the vision gets clearer. So is the mind.

Name is the first thing coming back, language the second.

"Dean." He can see through the shape now, the light of his soul still blinding. The man's name emerges in his beast's mind. Castiel almost makes a long gnarl, but he restrains himself -- Dean might hear him, and then he wouldn't know what to do.

Looking down, he sees his claws on the dusty ground, distained by the dirt and blood. In the reflection of the stream, he sees his own face and he moves back immediately, not wanting to see the hideous figure ever again.

He makes sure Dean wouldn't either.

The woods provide enough of cover, even with his size. He wanders far enough to hunt and grow strength, but not too far to lose Dean's bright lighted soul out of view -- in the end, how can one lose sight of the Sun in the sky?

But then, there are the attackers. The vampires edging and crowding Dean, there are too damn many of them. The bright light of the soul starts getting overshadowed, the threat of fangs and paws on the body's neck, the danger that is too strong to conquer, and worst of all, the light itself is willingly going out.

Castiel can't have it. For all his existence, this is the thing he cannot allow happen, whatever the cost.

So there is the emerge, and there is the attacking and biting and eating just out of instinct.

The metallic bloody smell assail the nostril, the vampire's head between the teeth, it is only then does Castiel realize this is the time when Dean would raise the blade and bury it inside his body.

He freezes, widening the eyes.

The vision clears, the face shows in front of him. Dean. It's really Dean. As human as he can be, the face, the body, every inch of the existence so familiar. And his blade high and ready.

"Dean." He calls his name, desperate. The only sound rolling out of his throat is the monster's roar.

Castiel thinks this is the end of it. The end of him, anyway. With all his efforts, at least the very last thing -- very last person -- in his view is Dean. He shouldn't complain too much.

He looks into the man's eyes, really looking. Like the mermaid being taken away the voice, the eyes and looks are all he has. He sees the familiar amber green in the man's eyes, the exhaustion, the anger, the confusion. And something else.

He pleads silently. "Please see me, Dean."

The blade is lowered.

Dean is always so full of surprise.
