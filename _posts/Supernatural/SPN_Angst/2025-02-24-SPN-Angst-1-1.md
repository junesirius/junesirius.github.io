The impala is parked in the back alley by the two-story building. The place doesn't have light on, but some of the windows are broken, taste of copper and blood floating outside. One can only imagine how much blood must have been spilled inside the place for the back alley to smell the same.

Sam and his grandfather hurry out of their van, rushing into the place, machete ready in hands.

There are bodies without head all the way from the stairs leading to the main hall. The red carpet of blood -- but not human blood, vampire's.

Sam glances that the separated heads rolling around on the floor, seeing fangs with dripping blood. None of them move an inch anymore.

Samuel sees the same, catching his grandson's eyes, nodding at the only entrance towards the larger opening. Both of them walking fast and quiet, trained hunter steps. With machetes tight in hands, just in case.

The place is quiet. Too quiet. Even their silent footsteps might become the source of an echo.

And then, there is the sound of fighting again. Yelling and pulling, metal hitting each other, fist punching face.

They dash into the main ball room.

Dean is covered in blood, his own or others they do not know. The bigger vampire that bit him earlier has a smirk on his face, pulling his collar and throwing him into the ground like he weighs nothing. Dean lets out an angry growl, rolling on the ground in time to dodge a fierce direct blow in the face, grabbing the knife he dropped and jumping back on his feet, circling the other vampire, eyes bloody, pupil dilated.

Sam hesitates. Samuel eyes him.

"Don't want to hurt Dean." Sam says, not moving ahead, not helping.

Dean gets wrestled and tripped by the other vampire, legs entangled, can't move easily. He's apparently so much stronger than he is. And by the look of fighting, six hundred years of living isn't teaching him nothing.

Dean can't breathe, fingers fumbling on the face of the bigger man, scratching his eye socket, leaving bloody fingernail marks, but the other man does not move away. Dean's movement gets slacker, arms slumping to the ground.

The other vampire lets the grip loose, Sam catches the break and marches forward, but he's two steps too far away when the vampire dives to the silver knife Dean left behind, cuts his head off in clean move. Sam's machete slides through his throat right in the next second.

Two heads roll away from their bodies, blood spilling everywhere.

Sam flinches, staring at his brother's head, gasping loud. "Dean!"

Dean's eyes are still wide open, green, reflecting the colors on the reflective carving glass over head. And then the lights go out. The fangs still out, ugly, covering his own teeth.

"Oh my God!" Sam kneels down by his brother's body, hands on his shoulder, inhaling heavily.

Samuel looks away, swallowing hard.

So much for going out swinging.

So much for the half retiring and apple-pie life.

Sam helps him close the eyes. And knits his head back to his body, later. With floss.

He burns his brother's body on a pyre. And then drives away in his car.

The town is left behind in the rear mirror.

Soon, the whole Illinois is left behind miles away.

The vampire nest was set to fire before they left. Any other bodies or signs of life burn to the ashes.

<br>

Dean wakes up in a gasp, touching his neck reflectively. The skin on the neck complete, his head still connected to his body.

"What the hell?" He looks around. The sky grey, the trees all half dying around him. The whole place creeps him out, but the most creepy thing is, he seems still alive.

He touches his upper gum. The fangs are still pointy there.

"Okay? So not dying, but still a vamp." He says to himself, disgusted. Eyeing around again, his fingers fumbles on the back of his belt, but he can't find a weapon.

Hunter's instinct kicks in just in time, his body moves before his ears catch the sound. Something jumps on him from the back, Dean rushes around, elbowing it in the face, arms wrapping its neck until it stops moving. Dean drops the body and recognizes the face of a young boy -- the young vampire body he sure as hell cuts the head off no more than few hours ago, before he somehow gets transmitted into this weird land.

"You're dead." Dean frowns at the motionless -- probably just temporarily passed out -- body, thinking aloud. Realization dawns on him. "Which means I'm dead too. God dammit!"

Dean kicks on the trunk of a tree closest to him with all his force, frustratingly. "Fuck!"

He kicks again, as if it can make him feel better. "So what? This is some monsterland the dead vamp would go and I'm stuck here?"

No one answers his question, except for some more creatures lurking closer because of his noise.

Looks like more than vampires then, Dean concludes, thinking he sees something that definitely look like a werewolf and another like wendigo. Every freaking monster he and his brother and every hunter has ever killed would be here then. And if they remember him in the whatever afterlife memory thing they still have, they sure as hell would be thrilled to see him hanging around with them. Dean realizes.

That's when he picks a direction, and starts running into the creepy woods. The growls and howling of every kind of monsters sounding around him like the most dedicated freaky monster symphony.

He has nothing but his hands and feet. And his fangs. Almost like a weird comfort now, come to think of it.

It's gonna be a bloody long eternity.

Sam is two states over when Cas drops by.

The case looks like an angelic weapon case. Sam tells him, people dying because of telling truths.

"Looks like it's your department?" Sam points at a picture of Gabriel's Horn of Truth to him.

Cas flies away and back in two seconds. Nothing angelic in the town. He tells him.

Sam makes a snort. "Where did you look?"

"Everywhere." Cas looks him in the eyes, then looks around. It's a single bed motel room, the bedsheet on the only bed unruffled. One duffel bag on the ground.

"Where is your brother?" Cas frowns.

"Dean's dead." Sam tells him, plainly.

"What?!" Castiel snaps. "You prayed for me for a possible horn but didn't think of letting me know that Dean's dead?"

Sam looks at him, also frowning. "What's there to pray for if he's already gone?"

Cas opens his mouth, unbelievable, wetting his lips, but not saying anything. He shakes his head, walking several steps away, back towards Sam.

"How?" His voice low and grave.

"Vampires." Sam deadpans. "It's a vampire nest, we went in there too late, Dean killed most of them but got taken down by the largest one. I killed it."

"You let Dean go into a vampire nest all by himself? Without backup?" Cas turns around, furious.

"Dean volunteered." Sam says it like it's obvious.

"And why would he do such a stupid thing?" Cas's eyes narrow.

"Because he's a vampire himself."

That is the dropping bomb.

Cas stares at him, eyes so startlingly widened -- if Sam doesn't know better, he'd say Cas almost looks horrified.

And then with a sound of wings flapping, Cas is gone.

Sam goes back to the case.

<br>

Heaven is heavily guarded, nowadays. By Raphael's troops and his loyalists. Cas's army is on the far periphery of the Heaven, still gathering around but far too few in number and in power. Going in the private chamber area where the souls are secured is no less than suicide mission. He goes anyway.

Sneaking into the white corridor reflected by too bright light from all four directions, he looks for the names on the doors. With everyone that has a last name "Winchester", he finds John and Mary, he finds Henry, their distant cousins from other branches, people not related but has the same last name. But there is no Dean. In all the human history with all the human named "Winchester", there is no "Dean" in the Heaven, born 1979, died 2010. Not in John and Mary's chamber, not anywhere.

"What's the matter, lost your little human pet?" A patrol angel notices him, approaching. Raphael's man.

Cas slides his Angel Blade into grip, ready to fight. The angel throws himself at him, young and unexperienced. Cas throws his blade out, right into his chest. The angel burst into bright light and lumps into nothing but a pile of vessel.

Cas sighs, eyeing the corridor that doesn't have the person he came looking for, picking up the Blade and rushing to the other side.

More patrols hear the noise, gathering in this direction. He has to leave the place in a rush.

<br>

Crowley is not happy to see him, not at all, to say the least.

"Why are you here again?" He's halfway poking a monster's brain, electrical pod in his gloved hand, blood stains on his apron.

"I need to find the Purgatory. NOW!" Cas sterns.

"Great! That makes the two of us." Crowley makes his voice sounds cheerful. "Then why don't you go ahead with your whatever quest and bring me more Alphas, we'll figure that out soon."

Castiel takes two steps ahead, right in front of Crowley, almost growling into his face. "You don't understand. Soon is not enough, I need it NOW!"

Crowley eyes him. "What's the rush? Already the check-mate time upstairs?"

Castiel looks away.

"Not the war then." Crowley reads his face. "Then must be the Winchesters. What, they have a sudden interest in the place as well or something?"

Cas shifts uneasily, moving further away, fluttering. "No."

"My my, can't be one of them already gone there, can they?" Crowley makes an exaggerated tsk. "No wonder you can't wait a single second. Always too fond of those two you can't focus on anything now, are you?"

Cas glares at him, snaps. "Yes! Dean's there! Okay? Satisfied?"

The demon hums, almost does sound enjoying himself too much. "All the more reasons to poke around the Alphas, don't you think? Chop, chop, Feathers, don't want to make your boyfriend wait down there for too long."

Cas thins his lips, lines tight. "Do you have more information from your side?" His head tilting towards that little creature Crowley tied to the stretcher.

The demon gives it a shock as he speaks, the monster moans at the electric strike. Crowley listens to the sound like it's music. "Nothing yet. I'll drop a dine when I find anything --"

"Good." Cas cuts. Within a blink, he flies away.

Crowley puffs out a laugh. "Talking about motivations."
