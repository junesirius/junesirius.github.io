Dean is so tired. His body does not wear out, but his mind is way too overloaded.

He doesn't know the days and nights. There is no sun or moon, there is no time. There is just hunting and hunted, chasing and chased, killing and killed.

His mind is blurred with the repetition of the same sets of movements -- being attacked from all directions, individually or in groups, at once or in turns, monsters of all kinds, then his body goes into autopilot mode. He doesn't need to think much about any movement, and given time, the monsters would all become a pile of flesh and blood by his feet. Sometimes even he is surprised himself that he's the last one left standing. He staggers away from the slaughterhouse, moving to the next.

Call it survival instinct or whatever, he's fighting his ass out of here.

There must be a way out. Dean tells himself.

If the past thirty years of living this life have taught him anything, it's the fact that any problem can have a solution. And now he has a problem -- stuck in this monsterland afterlife as a vampire, so he just has to find a solution to leave here and fix himself. And hopefully, fix Sam too.

The last glint of memory flashes by and he sees Sam's face twitching as he was bitten, and later, as he was being killed.

And fix Cas too, now that he really thinks about it. There is definitely something wrong with Cas too -- without seeing the angel for almost a year, the things he said about not having the luxury of caring about torturing a kid, or caring about anything, really. Whatever that angel civil war thing is, Cas has changed. They'll figure that out too, together. Once he's back in the game.

God, so many problems.

Dean waves the new bone blade he just snatched from a dead vampire, feeling its weight in his hands, sensing some comfort in having a real weapon finally.

"Okay," he tells himself, "one thing at a time then."

He spots a stream at the edge of the woods, and starts following it, moving downstream.

As it turns out, if an angel really puts their mind into hunting, they can be a damn good hunter -- the best hunter in the world that a hunter could ever be, actually.

The vicious things give off a dark vibe, not as evil as demons, but also stink so much that they differ from humans. Castiel can sense them, pick them out from the crowd like peas from rice. He drags random werewolves, shapeshifters, vampires, or djinns out of their nests. Sometimes he drops them at Crowley's lab; other times, he fries their brains himself when reading their minds.

He doesn't have the luxury of taking things slowly now, Castiel tells himself. Every minute wasted on Earth, every minute spent talking to a monster when he can just reach inside and read, he thinks of Dean in Purgatory, being hunted and chased by millions of monsters. He thinks of Dean trapped there, alone, as a vampire, and dying.

Castiel's eyes glow with blue-white light, the two vampires in front of him vaporize in an instant. They don't know anything about Purgatory or their Alpha anyway, or if they do, they refuse to give him up. Castiel decides they aren't worth his patience.

"I think that's far enough, Angel." A low male voice sounds behind him.

Castiel turns around, the grace in his eyes barely receding. He has the angel blade ready.

The man has a strong build, decent suits and outfits -- at first glance, he could fit perfectly into some upper-class gathering, drinking afternoon tea and talking horse racing with fancy ladies and gentlemen of Old Britain. Except the tea is probably made of human blood. Castiel can see the fangs just as clearly as he can see the man's skin and clothes.

"Alpha vampire," Castiel says, the closest thing to a greeting.

"You killed enough of my children." The vampire speaks in a slow, almost elegant tone -- the tone of someone who has been living for centuries. "I understand you want to schedule an appointment."

"Where is Purgatory?" Castiel asks, the only thing he cares about.

"Why would you want to know?" the Alpha vampire asks, almost politely.

But Castiel's patience is wearing thin. He takes a few steps closer. "Would you believe me if I say it's actually to save a friend? One who's been turned into one of you?"

The thought of Dean being a vampire hurts just as much as knowing he's in Purgatory. Cas thinks, almost winces at the thought, but makes sure it doesn't show. He shuts that train of thought off. They'll figure that out later, once he finds the place and finds him.

"Dean Winchester, is it?" The Alpha studies his face. Castiel keeps his expression straight. As much as the uneasiness of being scrutinized, he holds his face blank, staring back at the vampire.

"So you know him," Castiel says as an answer.

"Not just know him. I saw through his mind as he saw through mine," the vampire states flatly.

That makes Castiel squint. He tilts his head. "What do you mean?"

The Alpha vampire smiles. "Our minds -- think of it as a hive. I can feel all of my children, no matter where they are, and they can feel me. So when Dean was one of us, he was no exception."

"Was?" Cas can't help noticing.

"Purgatory isn't exactly a signal-covered zone, you might say."

Castiel swallows, pushing down hard on the thoughts that Dean might be dead -- that's why the connection breaks, dead even in the afterlife, dead in every sense -- pushing away the contemplation of where he would go next. He doesn't have time for this sick twisting feeling curling low in his stomach. He pushes it all down to the bottom.

Castiel raises his angel blade higher, standing in a more menacing stance. "Do you know how to get there?"

"I might," the vampire says, unshaken by the killing look in the angel's eyes or his blade, knowing far too well how negotiation and leverage usually work.

"And?" Castiel tries hard not to sound too desperate but fails.

"While I can't take you there personally, I know someone who can. It's no problem." The vampire looks him in the eyes, grinning wider. "Now, shall we talk terms?"

It is not a good deal, technically. Castiel knows that too well, and so does the Alpha vampire. But he gets what he needs, so he gives the monster what he asks for -- not to hurt any other vampires like he did before, in exchange for a name that hopefully is the real deal and knows the pathway to Purgatory.

Castiel gives him his word. "But I can't promise other hunters will do the same, the vampires would still get killed."

The Alpha shrugs. "A few of you kill a few of us, some of my children feed on some humans -- that's called balance. That's nature. Only what you were doing -- wiping out the board to get to me -- that's something I cannot allow. I have to protect my children, that you must understand."

Castiel does not answer.

They part ways.

<br>

The taxi driver is sitting in the driver's seat of a yellow cab, reading a newspaper, parked in a back alley in Warsaw, Missouri. Castiel knocks on the window.

"Ajay?"

The man looks up. "You know my name."

"And what you do." Castiel gives him a sharp look.

"What, you want a ride?" Ajay glances back, gesturing at the glowing "taxi" sign on top of the car.

"A ride, yes, but going down." Castiel says plainly, "To Purgatory. Reapers have the way, and rogue ones do that for a profit. Like you."

Ajay steps out of the car, eyeing him up and down. "And why would an angel want to go to Purgatory?"

"That is my business," Castiel states flatly.

Ajay shrugs. "Sure. And if you get killed down there, also not my business. Not exactly having insurance around here."

Castiel nods. "I understand. One ticket down, two tickets up. How does that work?"

Ajay raises an eyebrow. "I didn't say I'd do that yet. What's your payment?"

Castiel frowns. "What do you want?"

The rogue reaper curls his lips. "A little fuel in stock would be nice, just in case some days I need it, as good as human souls."

Castiel glares at him. "You want my grace?"

"Not all of it. Just a tiny bit. You'll grow back, won't you?" The slimy reaper conjures a small glass vial into his palm, holding it out. "So, do we have a deal?"

It's not a large vial, to be honest, but still, losing grace -- trading it -- is unholy. There are so many spells others could cast with the grace he gives away to harm him, or even kill him. And if Ajay is corrupted by Raphael and this is his way of getting to him, then...

But Dean is waiting. Cas's mental image shifts. Dean has been in Purgatory for so long, and if he doesn't reach him soon, if he's too late, then... death in the afterlife -- Would that mean gone forever? That he would never see him again?

Castiel grabs the vial and uses the angel blade to cut his left forearm. The sparkling light of grace flows from the wound, filling the small glass container. His human body inhales automatically at the prickling pain.

He covers the wound with his other palm once the vial is full. The skin is healed in an instant, but the loss of grace still makes him stumble slightly, as if his legs can't quite hold his weight for a moment, or his head becomes too heavy and dizzy -- not unlike a human losing just enough blood to be lightheaded before turning vital.

He hands the vial back, ignoring the uncomfortable sensation.

"Lead the way," he tells him sternly.
