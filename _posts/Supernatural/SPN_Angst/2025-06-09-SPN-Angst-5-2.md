Castiel walks out of the shelter, standing in the opening between the trees.

Dean follows him closely, watching the angel's eyes light up like every time he ate monster souls when he was still in that creature form. Dean finds his brain drifting away briefly, tempted to ask if Cas remembers everything happened back then but quickly decides now is not the best time.

There are tiny lights like small stars flying from all directions toward Cas. Whatever he's doing, the food source is coming to him like whales feeding in the ocean.

Dean watches the light show with a gaping mouth. "If you can do that, why did we even bother hunting them one by one?" he can't help asking but Cas is probably too occupied to answer him right this moment. Dean just watches the light pouring into Cas's mouth and dissolving into the bright glowing figure he's gradually turning into.

Cas is like an expanding supernova, brightening to as bright as the sun, and more soul lights are still flying toward his open mouth.

Dean's awe quickly turns to panic. "Maybe don't eat all of them, Cas?" he shouts desperately, hoping Cas can still hear him in the middle of the big light circle. "Or take it slowly?"

The incoming souls fly at a slower speed now. Dropped from the shooting bullet speed at the very beginning, now they are just like birds gliding through the air. It seems Cas heard him. Dean breathes a little easier.

Then Cas drops to his knees suddenly, clutching his chest. The incoming lights stop abruptly.

"Cas!" Dean yells, bolting toward him. The light around him gradually dims, so does the light in his pupils.

The veins on Cas's face and neck bulged with a dark black color, writhing under his skin like black worms creeping out.

Dean has seen plenty of freaky shit in his life and this still shoots ice through his spine.

He grabs Cas by the shoulders, steadying him just in case he collapses or throws up -- which, judging by his pale sweaty face and the wriggling black lines in his veins, seems to be the very next thing he's about to do.

Cas's eyes are open but unfocused.

"Talk to me, Cas, buddy, what's wrong?" Dean watches him closely.

Cas's chest rises and falls violently. His breath is so uneven and broken as if he's trying so desperately hard to choke back pain clawing from the inside under control.

Finally, he shifts his eyes onto Dean's face.

"The Leviathans," Cas manages to spit out the word with a croaked voice, even deeper than his usual voice.

"What about them?" Dean's stomach flips. He wipes sweat off Cas's forehead with his fingers -- since when do angels sweat? Cas's skin feels cold -- he's definitely sick if he's a human.

"In me. They're in me and they're alive." Cas croaks. His face furrows deeply, his eyes closed again as if the bare effort of keeping them open exhausts him.

"Oh God," Dean gasps sharply, his blood running cold. He remembers the black goo he fed Cas with when they barely survived that siege, and it was definitely still moving. And he remembers the filthy things can practically glue themselves together no matter how many pieces he cuts them. Which means they are reassembling inside Cas, however that's happening.

"I poisoned you," Dean realizes with horror. "Right when I thought I was helping you recover, I was killing you."

Cas shakes his head with his eyes shut. "Not your fault. We didn't know."

His breathing evens out gradually, Dean still doesn't let his hands go. The black worms in Cas's veins on his face crawl slower and the color is fading. But Dean doesn't know if it means they are handled by whatever angel immune system can do or they just crawl deeper underneath the surface now.

Cas opens his eyes and tries to stand. Dean holds his arms and helps him rise.

"Bad poisonous crab," Cas murmurs.

Dean doesn't understand it for a second, then he cracks up. He laughs so hard that he doesn't even realize he has tears at the corners of his eyes again.

Cas glances at him with a pure joyful glint in his eyes.

"That's gotta be the worst joke in history," Dean comments.

"It's the best if it made you laugh," Cas answers with a small smile of his own.

Dean tilts his head slightly, close to a nod. "Can't argue with that."

Then Cas says quietly, "It's nice to see you laugh like that again."

Dean's smile drops. They both hear the unsaid part: "If it's the last thing I'd ever see again."

Dean swallows again, then asks, "How do you feel?"

"I need to continue," Cas answers simply, "I haven't taken enough power yet."

Dean figures as much, but hearing it still makes his stomach drop, "Any way to filter out the bad food?"

"I can try, but it might be difficult," Cas says.

"Try then," Dean begs.

Cas meets his eyes, giving him a small nod, and the process starts again.

Dean has to retreat a few steps away when the light show resumes. Looking at them long and closely enough, he thinks he can tell the difference between some of them. The soul lights have different sizes and colors, most of them are like sparkling fireworms, tinted with faint colors, white and red are the most common ones. He wouldn't be surprised if red means vampire, which also means must be what his own soul looks like right about now. There are also black spots speckled among the other soul lights, must be Leviathans if he has to guess.

Thankfully, there aren't that many black specks, judging by what he can see. It's a small relief, but it's still not good enough. Dean stands there watching all the light dots flying into Cas's mouth, feeling useless.

Knowing those poisonous monsters will be hurting Cas from inside but he can't do anything, it's almost as bad as watching his mom and his house burn again. The flame of that night's fire is still scorching hot and red at the back of his retina. The bloody shades that would never disappear. And right now, with Cas standing in the middle of the woods, glowing like an exploding star, the memory overlays right onto him.

Dean tastes blood just as he watches and thinks. He hadn't even realized he'd bitten his own lips until the metallic taste spread across his tongue. His throat is already moving automatically to swallow his own blood.

He's a vampire, his guardian angel is turning into a soul bomb with poisonous prebiblical things lurking inside him, and his brother is another puzzle mess they still haven't figured out what's wrong. Welcome to the Winchester freak show.

<br>

The last wave of lights pours into Cas and then there is no more.

Dean is already running toward Cas. A mixture of blood and black goo trickles from the corner of Cas's mouth. Dean's gut twists violently seeing him like this. Black markings bloom from under Cas's collar, creeping up his neck and face like a cobweb-shaped tattoo, except the shape is alive. The dark lines and curves slither beneath his skin, crawling from one side of the cheek through the forehead to the other side. Dean is sure if this were a horror movie, these black worms sure as hell would bite open the skin and crawl right out. Just the thought of that gives him goosebumps.

He has to force his eyes on Cas's, forcing himself on the thought that this is still Cas, whatever form he turns into, just like when he was in the creature form.

"Cas, talk to me, say something," Dean begs.

"You need to go now," Castiel says stiffly without looking at Dean. The voice doesn't sound like him, the squeaks and whispers hidden under the tone as if he has to speak over a whispering crowd below the surface. His hands are clenched into fists, held tightly against his body, straight and rigid, like he's using every bit of strength to keep them there.

Dean reaches out trying to hold Cas's arm, but Castiel yanks away. He raises his hand, palm-up, straight toward the forest clearing. Light and sound of an explosion burst out. A swirly circle the size of a grown man with blue white cloud on the edge erupts open right before their eyes. Dean doesn't have enough time to cover his ears and now they're buzzing badly. He curses loudly and can't hear his own words.

He sees Cas land his eyes on him once again, his lips moving, but Dean can't hear a thing. He gestures at his temporarily deafened ears pitifully.

Cas hovers a hand over his ear, and he can hear again. Better than that, the sound is quiet and peaceful like what he's used to as a human, without the constant pumping of blood running through the veins of every living creature. He touches his gums, and there are no more fangs.

But he doesn't have time to say thank you for fixing him.

"You have to go now," Cas pushes him.

Dean doesn't want to move. "Come with me."

A black tendril moves from Cas's cheek to his eyes, dying his right eye inky black. Staring at Dean with two eyes of different colors, Cas demands with a deep and dark voice, "Go, Dean, don't make me hurt you."
