The impala is parked in the back alley by the two-story building. The place doesn't have light on, but some of the windows are broken, taste of copper and blood overflowing outside. One can only imagine how much blood must have been spilled inside the place for the outside to smell the same.

Sam and his grandfather hurry out of their van, rushing into the place, machete ready in hands.

There are bodies without head all the way from the stairs leading to the main hall. A long red carpet made of blood -- but not human blood, vampire's.

Sam glances at the separated heads rolling around on the floor, seeing fangs with dripping blood. None of them move an inch anymore.

Samuel sees the same, catching his grandson's eyes, nodding at the only entrance towards the larger opening. Both of them walking fast and quiet, trained hunter steps.

The place is quiet. Too quiet. Even their silent footsteps might become the source of an echo.

And then, there is the sound of fighting again. Yelling and pulling, metal hitting each other, fist punching face.

They dash into the main ball room. Sam tightens the grip on the machete.

Dean is covered in blood, his own or others they do not know. The bigger vampire that bit him earlier has a smirk on his face, pulling Dean's collar and throwing him flying across the room like he weighs nothing. Dean lets out an angry growl, rolling on the ground in time to dodge a fierce direct blow in the face, grabbing the knife he dropped and jumping back on his feet, circling the other vampire, eyes bloody, pupil dilated, fangs out.

Sam hesitates. Samuel eyes him.

"Don't want to hurt Dean in accident." Sam whispers, not moving ahead, not throwing himself into the vampire fight.

Dean ducks and dodges for two three rounds, before getting wrestled and tripped by the other vampire, legs entangled, can't move easily. That monster is so much stronger than him. And by the look of fighting, how he swings his arms and fists, several hundred years of living isn't teaching him nothing.

Dean can't breathe, fingers fumbling on the face of the bigger man, scratching edge of his eye socket, leaving bloody fingernail marks, but the other man does not move away. Dean's movement gets slacker, arms slumping to the ground eventually.

The other vampire lets the grip loose, Sam catches the break and marches forward, but he's still two steps too far away when the vampire dives back with the silver knife Dean left behind, cuts his head off in a clean move. Sam's machete slides through his throat right in the next second.

Two heads roll away from their bodies, blood spilling everywhere, mostly on Sam's face.

Sam flinches, staring at the heads and bodies, gasping loud. "Dean!"

Dean's eyes are still wide open, amber green, reflecting the shifting colors of the carving glass on the high ceiling. And then the lights go out. The fangs still out, ugly, layering over his own teeth.

So much for going out swinging.

So much for the half retiring and apple-pie life.

"Oh my God!" Sam kneels down by his brother's body, hands on his shoulder, inhaling heavily.

Samuel looks away, swallowing hard.

Sam helps him close the eyes. And knits his head back to his body, later. With floss.

He burns his brother's body on a pyre. And then drives away in his car.

The town is left behind in the rear mirror.

Soon, the whole state of Illinois is left behind miles away.

The vampire nest was set to fire before they left. Any other bodies or signs of life burned to the ashes.

<br>

Dean wakes up in a gasp, touching his neck reflexively. The skin on the neck complete, his head still connected to his body.

"What the hell?" He looks around. The sky grey, the trees all half dying around him. The whole place creeps him out, but the most creepy thing is, he seems to be still kicking and running.

He touches his upper gum. The fangs are still pointy there, mostly hidden, for now.

"Okay? So not dead, but still a fucking vamp." He says to himself, disgusted.

Eyeing around again, hunter's instinct kicks in just in time. His fingers fumble to the back of his belt, find nothing but air. His body moves before his ears catch the sound, something jumps on him from the back.

Dean rushes around, elbowing it in the face, arms wrapping its neck from back, pressing whole body's strength on its throat until it stops moving. Dean drops the body and recognizes the face of a young boy -- the young vampire boy he sure as hell cuts the head off no more than a few hours ago, before he somehow gets transmitted into this weird land.

"You're dead." Dean frowns at the motionless -- dead before, probably just passed out now -- vampire body, thinking aloud. Realization dawns on him. "Which means I'm dead too. God dammit!"

Dean kicks the trunk of a tree closest to him with all his force, frustratedly. "Fuck!"

It's just a vampire case, an everyday job. He does not expect to check out just like that. Not today. But apparently he did.

He kicks again, as if it can make him feel better. "So what? This is some monsterland the dead vamp would go and I'm stuck here forever?"

No one answers his question, except for some more creatures lurking closer because of the noise.

Looks like more than vampires then, Dean concludes, thinking he sees something that definitely look like a werewolf and another like wendigo. Every freaking monster he and his brother and every hunter has ever killed would be here then. And if they remember him in the whatever afterlife memory thing they still have, they sure as hell would be thrilled to see him hanging around with them.

That's when he picks a direction, and starts running into the creepy woods. The growls and howling of every kind of monsters that ever existed sounding around him like the most dedicated freaky monster symphony.

He has nothing but his hands and feet. And his fangs. Almost like a weird comfort now, come to think of it.

It's gonna be a bloody long eternity.

<br>

Sam is two states over when Cas drops by.

The case looks like an angelic weapon case. Sam calls for him in a prayer, people killed because of telling truths.

"Looks like it's your department?" Sam points at a picture of Gabriel's Horn of Truth to him when the angel shows up.

Castiel flies away and back in two seconds. Nothing angelic in the town. He tells him.

Sam snorts. "Where did you look?"

"Everywhere." Cas looks him in the eyes, then looks around. It's a single bed motel room, the bedsheet on the only bed unruffled. One duffel bag on the ground.

"Where is your brother?" Cas frowns.

"Dean's dead." Sam tells him, flat.

"What?!" Castiel snaps. "You prayed for me for a possible horn but didn't think of letting me know that Dean's dead?"

Sam looks at him, also frowning. "What's there to pray for if he's already gone?"

Cas opens his mouth, unbelievable, wetting his lips, but not saying anything. He shakes his head, walking several steps away, his back towards Sam.

"How?" His voice low and grave.

"Vampires." Sam deadpans. "It's a vampire nest, we went in there too late, Dean killed most of them but got taken down by the largest one. I killed it, after."

"You let Dean go into a vampire nest all by himself? Without backup?" Cas turns around, furious.

"Dean volunteered." Sam says it like it's obvious.

"And why would he do such a stupid thing?" Cas's eyes narrow.

"Because he's a vampire himself."

That is the dropping bomb.

Cas stares at him, eyes so startlingly widened -- if Sam doesn't know better, he'd say Cas almost looks horrified.

And then with a sound of wings flapping, Cas is gone.

Sam goes back to the case.

<br>

Heaven is heavily guarded, nowadays. By Raphael's troops and his loyalists. Cas's army is on the far periphery of the Heaven, still assembling but far too few in number and in power. Going into the private chamber area where the souls are secured is no less than suicide mission. He goes anyway.

Sneaking into the white corridor covered by too bright light from all directions, he looks for the names on the doors. With everyone that has a last name "Winchester", he finds John and Mary, he finds Henry, their distant cousins from other branches, people not related but has the same last name. But there is no Dean. In all the human history with all the human named "Winchester", there is no "Dean" in the Heaven, born 1979, died 2010. Not in John and Mary's chamber, not anywhere.

"What's the matter, lost your little human pet?" A patrol angel spots him, approaching. Raphael's man.

Cas slides his angel blade into grip, ready to fight. The angel throws himself at him, young and unexperienced. Cas stabs his blade out, right into his heart. The angel bursts into bright light and lumps into nothing but a pile of meat suit.

Cas sighs, eyeing the corridor that doesn't have the person he came looking for one last time, picking up the blade and rushing to the other side.

More patrols hear the noise, gathering in this direction. He has to leave the place in a rush.

<br>

Crowley is not happy to see him, not at all, to say the least.

"Why are you here again?" He's halfway poking a monster's brain, electrical pod in his gloved hand, blood stains on his apron.

"I need to find the Purgatory. NOW!" Cas sterns.

"Great! That makes the two of us." Crowley makes his voice sound cheerful. "Then why don't you go ahead with your whatever quest and bring me more Alphas, we'll figure that out soon."

Castiel takes two steps ahead, right in front of Crowley, almost nose to nose growling into his face. "You don't understand. Soon is not enough, I need it NOW!"

Crowley eyes him. "What's the rush? Already the check-mate time upstairs?"

Castiel looks away.

"Not the war then." Crowley reads his face. "Then must be the Winchesters. What, they have a sudden interest in the place as well or something?"

Cas shifts uneasily, moving further away, fluttering. "No."

"My my, can't be one of them already gone there, can they?" Crowley makes an exaggerated tsk. "No wonder you can't wait a single second. Always too fond of those two you can't focus on anything now, are you?"

Cas glares at him, snapping. "Yes! Dean's there! Okay? Satisfied?"

The demon hums, almost does sound enjoying himself too much. "All the more reasons to poke around the Alphas, don't you think? Chop, chop, Feathers, don't want to make your boyfriend wait down there for too long."

Cas thins his lips, lines tight. "Do you have more information from your side?" His head tilting towards that little creature Crowley tied to the stretcher.

The demon gives it a shock as he speaks, the monster moans at the electric strike. Crowley listens to the sound like it's music. "Nothing yet. I'll drop a dine when I find anything --"

"Good." Cas cuts. Within a blink, he flies away.

Crowley puffs out a laugh. "Talking about motivations."

<br>

### Chap. 1-2

> **Outline:** Dean fights, tries to come back but can't go through human portal
>
> Cas finds rogue reaper Ajay, tries to go purgatory as angel but fail to leviathans (Naomi: took a lot angels to fetch Cas)

Dean is so tired. His body does not weary, but his mind is way too overloaded.

He doesn't know the days and nights, there is no sun or moon, there is no time. There is just hunting and hunted, chasing and chased, killing and killed.

His mind blurred with the repetition of the same sets of movements -- being attacked from all directions, individually or in group, at once or in turns, monsters of all kind, then his body goes into autopilot mode. He doesn't need to think much about any movement, and given time, the monsters would all become a pile of flesh and blood by his feet. Sometimes even he is surprised himself that he's the last one left standing. He staggers away from the slaughter house, moving to the next.

Call it survival instinct or whatever, he's fighting his ass out of here.

There must be a way out. Dean tells himself.

If the past thirty years of living this life teaches him anything, it's the fact that any problem can have a solution. And now he has a problem -- stuck in this monsterland afterlife as a vampire, so he just get to find the solution to leave here and fix himself. And hopefully, fix Sam too.

The last glint of memory flashes by and he sees Sam's face twitching as he was bitten, and later, as he was being killed.

And fix Cas too, now that he really think about it. There is something wrong with Cas too, without seeing him for almost a year, the things he said about not having the luxury of caring about torturing a kid, or caring about anything, really. Whatever angel civil war thing that is going on, Cas is changed. They'll figure that out too, together. Once he's back to the game.

God, so many problems.

Dean waves the new bone blade he just snatched from a dead vampire, feeling its weight in his hands, sensing some comfort for having a real weapon finally.

"Okay," He tells himself. "One thing at a time then."

He spots a stream at the edge of the woods, and starts following it, moving downstream.

<br>

As it turns out, if an angel really puts their mind into hunting, they can be a damn good hunter -- the best hunter in the world that a hunter could ever be, actually.

The vicious things give off a dark vibe, not as evil as demons, but also different from the humans. Cas can sense them, pick them out from the crowd like picking out peas from rice. He drags the random werewolves, shapeshifters, vampires, or djinns out of their nest, sometimes he drops them to Crowley's lab, other times he fries their brains out himself when reading their minds.

He doesn't have the luxury of taking things slowly now, he tells himself. Every minute wasted on the Earth, every minute spent talking to a monster when he can just reach inside and read, he thinks of Dean in the Purgatory, being hunted and chased by the millions of monsters in there, he thinks of Dean dead, there, alone, and as a vampire.

Castiel's eyes grow into blue white lights, the two vampires in front of him vaporized. They don't know anything about Purgatory or their Alpha anyway, or if they do, they refuse to give them up. Castiel decides they do not worth his patience.

"I think that's far enough, Angel." A low male voice sounds up behind him.

Castiel turns around, the grace in his eyes barely recedes. He has the angel blade ready.

The man has a strong built, decent suits and outfits, at the first sight he can fit perfectly into the upper class, drinking afternoon tea and talking horse racing with the ladies and gentlemen. Except the tea is probably made of human blood. Castiel can see the fangs just as he can see the man's skin and clothes.

"Alpha vampire." Cas speaks, closest thing to a greeting.

"You killed enough of my children." The vampire has a slow, almost elegant tone -- the tone of someone who has been living for centuries. "I understand you want to schedule an appointment."

"Where is the Purgatory?" Cas asks the only thing he cares about.

"Why would you want to know?" Alpha vampire asks, almost politely.

But Cas's patience is wearing out fast. He takes a few steps closer. "Would you believe if I say it's actually to save a friend? Who gets turned into one of you?"

The thought of Dean being a vampire hurts just as much as knowing he's in the Purgatory. Cas thinks, almost winces by just thinking it, but he makes sure it doesn't show. He shuts that train of thoughts off. They'll figure that out later, once he finds the place and finds him.

"Dean Winchester, is it?" The Alpha studies his face. Cas maintains his expression straight, even if there is any uneasiness of being scrutinized, he makes them blank.

"So you know him." He says as an answer.

"Not just know him, I saw through his mind as he saw through mine." The vampire states it factually.

That makes Cas squints. He tilts his head. "What do you mean?"

The Alpha Vampire smiles. "Our minds, think of it as a hive. I can feel all of my children, no matter where they are, and they can feel mine. So when Dean was one of us, he was no exception."

"Was?" Cas can't help noticing.

"Purgatory isn't exactly the signal cover zone, you may say."

Cas swallows, pushing down hard at the thoughts that Dean might be dead, that's why the connection breaks, dead even in the afterlife, dead in every sense, pushing away the pondering of where he would go next. He doesn't have time for this twisting and sick feeling curling low in his stomach now. He pushes them all down to the bottom.

Cas raises the angel blade higher, more menacingly. "Do you know how to get there?"

"I might." The vampire says, unshifted by the look in the angel's eyes or his blade, knowing far too well about how negotiation or leverage usually work.

"And?" Cas tries hard not to sound too desperate but fails.

"And while I can't take you there personally, I know someone who can. It's no problem." The vampire looks at him in the eyes, grinning wider. "Now, shall we talk terms?"

It is not a good deal, technically. Cas knows it far too clear, so does the Alpha Vampire. But he gets what needs, so he gives the monster what he asks too -- not to hurt any other vampires like he did before, to exchange for a name that hopefully is a real deal and knows the pathway to the Purgatory.

Cas gives him his words. "But I can't promise other hunters would do the same, the vampires would still get killed."

The Alpha shrugs. "A few of you kill some of us, some of my children feed on a few of humans, that's called balance. That's nature. Only what you were doing, wiping out the board to get to me, that's something I cannot allow. I have to protect my children, that you must understand."

Castiel does not answer.

They part ways.

<br>

The taxi driver is sitting in the driver's seat of a yellow cab, reading a newspaper, at a back alley in Warsaw, Missouri. Cas knocks at the window.

"Ajay?"

The man looks at him. "You know my name."

"And what you do." Cas gives him a look.

"What, you want a ride?" Ajay glances back, hinting at the "taxi" sign on top of the vehicle.

"A ride, yes, but going down." Cas says. "To Purgatory. Reapers have way, and rogue ones do that for a profit. Like you."

Ajay steps out of the car, looking him up and down. "And why would an angel want to go to the Purgatory?"

"That is my business." Cas states, blankly.

Ajay shrugs. "Sure, and if you get killed down there, also not my business. Not exactly having an insurance around here."

Cas says, "I understand. One ticket down, two tickets up. How does that work?"

Ajay raises his eyebrows. "I didn't say I'd do that yet. What's your payment?"

Cas frowns. "What do you want?"

The rogue reaper curls his lips. "A little fuel in stock would be nice, just in case some days I need it, as good as human souls."

Cas glares at him. "You want my grace?"

"Not all of them, just a tiny bit, you'll grow back, don't you?" The slimy reaper magics a glass vial into his palm, holding straight. "So do we have a deal?"

It's not a large vial, to be honest, but still, losing grace -- trading it -- is unholy. There are so many spells others can do with the grace he gives away to hurt him, or even kill him. And if Ajay is corrupted by Raphael and it's his way of getting to him, then...

But Dean is waiting. Cas's mental image shifts. Dean has been in the Purgatory for so long, and if he doesn't get to him soon, if he's too late then... the death in the afterlife, would that mean gone forever?

Cas grabs the vial and uses the angel blade to cut his left forearm. The sparkling light of grace flow out of the wound, filling into the small glass container. Cas's human body inhales in the pain from the cut. He covers the wound with the other palm, the wound is healed when he removes the palm, but the loss of grace still makes him stumble slightly, as if the legs can't exactly hold his whole body's weight for a moment, or the head becomes too heavy and dizzy.

He hands the vial back, ignoring the uncomfortable feeling.

"Lead the way." He tells him.

<br>

The end of stream leads to an opening. The woods are sparse. The water looks clean -- cleaner.

Dean drops to his knees to scoop up some of the clear liquid to drink. The coolness washes down the dirt in his gullet, he breathes easier. He washes his face and hands too, but doesn't bother cleaning all the other blood stains on his cloth or skin.

In the reflection, Dean sees a face he can barely recognize, with the stubble covering his jaw, the dark bag around his eyes, bruises and cuts here and there. And the fangs, the ugly uneven fangs pointing out, visible whenever he opens the mouth, refusing to contract however hard he demands his body to. Dean claps on the surface to break the image, to not have to look at that face again.

He leaves the water side, heading towards the middle of the opening where, according to some of the old creatures he killed earlier, there would sometimes be some disturbance of air flow, no one in here knows where the stir comes from, but if Dean has to guess, this is where the vail is the weakest.

If long shot is all he can get then Dean would take it. He walks towards the said position. Waving his blade at the nothingness in the air, observing, thinking, waiting. The air is unmoved, but his gut is giving him a drag, hair on the back of his head straighten up, expecting something or someone approaching.

Dean stares at the middle of the ground hard, blade in hand, counting his own bumping heartbeat. Waiting.

<br>

The back alley where the taxi is parked is connected right to a small opening surrounded by four painted walls. The drawings are wild and over colorful, dizzying and frantic. Looking at them for too long might make one's head ache if they are human. Cas looks at them for a moment and then looks away.

"You have thirty minutes. I'll see you where I drop you. Don't miss the ride, alright?" Ajay gives him a sly grin, starting the ritual without waiting for an answer.

The air swirls, sands and dirt rise from the ground, creating a small sandstorm. In front of him, the wall painting comes alive, opening up and swallowing him in.

The next blink, the surrounding shifts. The walls and streets disappear into bleak woods and grey sky. Monster growl in the distance. Except --

They're not really in the distance.

Black smoke dropping to the ground around him like debris of an asteroid crashing onto a planet. Creatures with no face but all teeth emerges from the smoke, surrounding him and shrinking the circle fast.

"What?--" That is the only syllable Cas can make before the attacking begins.

They are fast, and strong. So strong even as an angel he can't compete their strength. Cas is thrown into the air by this one and that, sharp black teeth sinking into his flesh. He does not know if it's his vessel or his grace that is being devoured. He screams in pain and feels strength losing quick.

"We are Leviathans." One of them enjoy too much in its feast on him they actually bother answering his question.

Castiel gasps in disbelief. The prebiblical monster that would devour every living thing that ever exists, devour the whole planet and world if given the chance, God has to create a whole Purgatory to lock them away. He has heard of them like a story baby angels would heard from guardian angels as a bedside story. And now, he's in the middle of their dinner table.

For a split of second, Cas thinks this might be his way of dying -- his true and final death. Becoming shared food of the Leviathans, without having a chance of finding Dean or saving him from this place. His internal twists. Cas focuses all his attention on the scrape of grace he still have left, trying -- thinking -- about exploding himself one last time just to get rid of these filthy creatures that live in the same dimension as Dean. That is when he feels the grips and teeth on his body loosens.

Flashes of a blade shine in front him, the teethy head flying up before dropping to the ground, rolling a few steps away, spilling rain of black drops.

Castiel drags himself up, looking at the figure fighting the creatures that are now starting to surround --

"Dean!" He cries out his name.

"Cas?" Dean answers automatically, looking in his direction, over joyfully, eyes sparkling.

But just that blinks of distraction leaves enough of a fatal gap, the Leviathan he was fighting with gets the jump on him, the multilayers of teeth opening up, angling itself to bite on Dean's shoulder. Dean is pinned to the ground, immobilized.

"NO!!" Castiel rages, eyes blaring bright. "Close your eyes!" He manages to shout at the last moment, can't see if Dean has covered his eyes or not, pouring his power onto that Leviathan that is going to hurt Dean. Castiel can't think or see anything else.

When the light is out, Dean pants. The Leviathans are still there, even more than before. The one baring Cas's angelic rage backs off a few steps, but it doesn't seem to hurt, not fatally anyway. It widens the ugly mouth, laughing. It's voice as sharp as its teeth, and it says, smirkingly, "Rock beats scissor, Leviathans beat angel."

There is no way they can win them, no way to even get a head start to run away from them long enough to reach back to the ride the rogue reaper promised.

"Dean!" Cas is desperate, doesn't even have time to check if Dean is hurt. His vision blocked by more apparently irritated Leviathans attracted from the light show. There is no way he can make it out alive, the monsters are obviously more interested in him than anything else, but Dean, if Dean can make it to the rendezvous point, then maybe --

"Dean! You have to go! I'll distract them! The -- the ride is coming soon --" The attacks already restart, the angel blade is doing very little, more teeth and black goo sinking into his flesh and bones, he screams in his true voice.

<br>

The yell of pain is the first thing that catches Dean's attention. The familiar trench coat the second.

The black smoke turns into monsters he's never seen before, all teeth no face, the ugliest thing one can ever imagine. But luckily, it seems beheading can do the charm, just like all the other creatures in this place -- at least temporarily.

Cutting his way through the surrounding circle, he sees Cas. Being torn apart alive, shredded by the teeth. Blood and grace floating from the wounds, he can't even tell what's the vessel and what's the angel.

Cas.

For that blink of time, emotions pour into him so quick Dean's almost dizzy with feelings, his steps stumble for the briefest instant, then immediately aiming the blade towards the closest uglyass thing.

Adrenaline pumping in his temple, blade raising and falling, heads falling, black blood spluttering, it almost becomes mechanic.

"Cas." Dean breathes out the name, looking him up and down, overturned by the joy of seeing him again. But there is no time for catching up, no time for a single word to say how extremely brightened up he is to see him, and also how pissed he is that these uglyass things sticky around the moment he appears and now they are in a bigger mess than handling wolves and vamps.

When he is pinned to the ground, watching the black goo dripping onto his face and teeth of the monster ready to take a bite on him, with the last bit of strength, Dean throws the last glimpse at Cas, who actually seems okay and meets him in the eyes -- the eyes so deep and pained he loses the ability to read what's in them. Despite the new wounds and cuts on the face and body, he can still straighten up and walk over. Alive. Cas is okay. Dean tries to pull a smile at him, only to see his eyes filled with the familiar bright color. He shuts his eyes in time. The pressure on top of him releases.

But it is not over. The monsters back off slightly, but they do not leave. Immune to angel power even, apparently. They took the hit like a bear to a rock thrown onto its head.

Circling around them only to look for the next opportunity to attack. There is no way the both of them can get out of here alive. And he's not going to let Cas "be the distraction" as he said. Not again.

The air in the opening brightens up not too far away from them. Even closer to the full circle of the Leviathans.

"Dean! You HAVE to go now!" Cas's voice is mixed with the shrieking high pitch of unrecognizable frequency and human words.

"I'm not leaving without you!" Dean shouts back, fighting his way towards the angel.

The blade cuts through the monsters, leaving bodies tumbling around them, but they're gluing back together and catching up rather quickly. The one that still has its teeth on Cas's leg, Dean makes sure it gets chopped into even smaller pieces, kicking its body far sideways.

"Come on! I got you!" He hauls Cas up, holding his arms on his shoulder, rushing towards the lighted exit.

And then he stumbles, feeling the pull on his own legs, a monster is dragging him back. Dean loses balance and drops to the ground, but they're so close now. Within two steps to the exit at most, he shoves Cas forward.

"No, Dean!" That is the last of Cas's voice he catches before the lights are out. No more exits.

He lets out a long breath. At least one of them are out.

Turning over to face the monsters on his tail, Dean raises his bone blade that is as long and sharp as their teeth.

Dean creeps a smile. "Game time?"

<br>

### Chap. 2

> **Outline:** Cas turns himself to monster (disturbing form, distorted wings etc.), death wish for sacrifice, gets killed by Sam as he wants, goes to purgatory
>
> (Ajay is killed by Crowley/Alpha/Raphael, so no going from that again)

Castiel tumbles onto the cement ground, the body crashing onto the solidity of the real world. His mind takes a second to register.

He looks behind him frantically. But there is just the air, the wall, the static surrounding.

No tree, no monster, no Dean.

"No, no, no, no, no!" He jumps to his feet, fists punching the colorfully painted wall, as if it can tear apart the bricks to reveal the opening again. As if Dean is right on the other side of the wall.

"You have to take me back again, Ajay!" He calls out behind him.

"I don't think Ajay can take you anywhere now." The voice makes his blood cold. Castiel looks back, realizing belatedly the whole place's air is buzzing with archangel's power. The lights over head flicker and blow up.

"Raphael." He turns around slowly, back pressed to the wall. Cornered.

Raphael is in a female vessel this time, the woman body is a few inches shorter than him. But the true form behind that vessel's face is still gigantic and dazzling bright.

Cas reaches to his inside, testing his grace. The fuel in tank so low that he can barely feel them, flowing sluggishly like trying to fetch out the last drop of water in a bottle. Zero chance this time then.

Raphael steps towards him, looking up at his face. The vial with his essence that he gave Ajay not long ago is in his grip, grace swirling inside the glass, soft and bright. The rogue reaper's body is limp by his cab on the ground, eyes burned out. Two other angels stand by the body.

"You killed him." Castiel shifts his eyes from the body back to the archangel, thinking hard, buying time.

"Thanks to you." Raphael shakes the vial slow, the grace inside turns faster like a tiny whirlpool. "This is beyond stupid even for you, Castiel. I'm disappointed, to be honest. I wasn't expecting you to be so... reckless. But in the end, dare to fight against me already tells that."

The human heart bumps hard and fast inside his chest. Is he human enough now for the spell to work? Cas feels the throbbing pain in the tears on his legs and over the whole body, wetness dripping from the wound. He takes the bet. The angel blade sliding into his palm behind his back.

"What are you going to do to me?" He looks at the archangel, questioning, not letting his eyes blink, not showing any fear that the other might be looking for.

"Kill you, of course." Raphael is only two steps away now. "I don't see God or Balthazar or any of the Winchester boys helping you this time."

Cas swallows, reflexively, at the bare mention of the word "Winchester", thought drifting away at the look Dean threw at him right before he pushed him out, letting himself be pulled away by the monsters. Oh God. He winces.

Raphael must notice that. The female face shows a slight hint of joy. "Feeling the fear now, finally? A little too late for that." The archangel raises his blade. "Good bye, Castiel."

Cas ducks aside, showing the angel banishing sigil he was drawing on the wall with his own blood. Palm pressed on the center of the sigil, it brightens up, blasting Raphael and the two other of his followers away. The blast gives himself a small heated burn on the side of the body that is closest to the wall, but that is all it does.

The small alley returns to dark and silence like there were never any angels there. Castiel leans back to the bloody wall, slumping slightly, rubbing at his own eyes, ignoring the dripping blood from the sliced palm.

Dean is still in Purgatory, he is exhausted and low in grace, the only being that can smuggle him to the Purgatory is dead. He needs a plan, but he can't think of one.

Castiel opens his eyes, looking up at the sky that is darkening slowly as the night falls, desperate. Almost like how human would pray. Dean would know what to do if he's here, he always can think of something. A next step, a joke to cheer up, an idea, something.

What would Dean do?

He gets an idea.

<br>

Cas appears in the middle of Bobby's living room. Bobby jumps, almost shoots him with the gun by his hand. And Sam actually does, far across the room from the couch. The bullet pierces through his shoulder, flying out from the other side, sinking into the wall behind him.

"Sam?!" Cas gasps in pain, staggering two steps back by the impact. Blood streaming down from the new wound.

Bobby rushes to him.

"Sorry, panicked." Sam says, stuffing the gun back into belt.

"You need to wear a bell next time." Bobby is in front of him now, eyeing the wound that is making his coat a mess. That actually pulls Cas's lip up a tiny little bit.

"Dean said that too."

The bullet hole remains a hole under close checkup. Looking back into his eyes, Bobby's frowns deepen, "Why ain't it healed already?"

Cas presses a palm on the shoulder, vainly trying to stop the burning and pungent sensation but it does nothing, blood seeping through his fingers. More exhausted than before, he starts to think it might be a bad idea to come here. "My grace, I'm drained." He has to admit.

"You were in a fight?" Sam asks.

"Not just any fight."

Cas tells them about the Purgatory, and Ajay, and Raphael, manages to leave out the parts with the Alpha and Crowley though. Bobby helps wrapping his shoulder and some obvious wounds on the legs in some bandage and he says thank you.

"Wow." Sam blinks at his eventful afternoon.

"I know." Cas looks down, sinking into the chair by the diner table, resting the wounded arm on the armrest.

"No, I mean, you actually went to Purgatory for Dean?" Sam looks amazed. "Not even I would think of something crazy like that, don't think anyone ever would."

"Well, maybe you should!" Cas stares at him. "He's your brother, and he needs our help."

Sam's face unmoved. Cas squints, "What happened to you? You used to care about Dean a lot more."

Sam shrugs. "Nothing." Then, he returns the stare, "What happened to you, Cas? You used to care about Dean a lot less."

Castiel looks away, uneasy, eyes lingering on the window half covered by the flowing curtain. It's all dark outside now. Is the Purgatory darker in the night or would the sky there remain the same lifeless bleach and grey forever?

"Seems like you two just balanced out then." Bobby comments behind them. Sam huffs a laugh, Cas does not.

"I just want to fix this." He says, quieter. He didn't tell them every single detail about the monsters and Leviathans, and how Dean looks like during that brief moment they met down there. The eyes flashed with relief and shortly covered by anger again. He chews on the image and the look.

"What happened to 'The dead should stay dead' and not upsetting the natural order?" Sam raises his brows.

Cas drags his thought back, feeling the bone-deep exhaustion and pained sensation all over him getting dumber but spreading, sprawling on every inch of his muscle and skin. Does human always feel like this when they are hurt? Does Dean?

"It's... he's just in another place. We can still bring him back." This is what Cas manages to land on. Not exactly an answer, but hopefully it's enough.

"Listen, Angel, I want Dean back as much as you do," Bobby chimes in. "But how? You said yourself, there is no elevator going down there and no more taxi driver to help, any genius idea now?"

"I was hoping to find some answer here." Cas looks at the old hunter, pointedly.

Bobby blinks. "I ain't get nothing."

Castiel nods at the mountainous books on the floor and on the shelves. "Your books might."

<br>

Cas pauses on a page, reading it over, and rereading it. Fingers rubbing the corner of the yellowed page that belongs to a black grimoire.

He stands up and walks towards the cabinet where Bobby keeps most of his spell ingredients and pots and pans. The other two men look up from their books.

"Find anything you want to share with the class?" Bobby's eyes follow his steps.

Cas's steps are still stumbling, the bandage that covers the gash on the calf leaks hints of black, the one on his shoulder red. He reaches the top shelf with the uninjured hand.

Bobby grabs the book that he was reading. Castiel already knows what he's going to hear.

"You can't possibly think about doing THAT?!" Bobby snaps, passing the book to Sam.

"Figured you might say that." Cas doesn't stop the movement, not looking back.

"Then you know how stupid this is! Cas, come on, there gotta be another way."

"What if there *is* no other way?" Cas grabs three jars the size of vase, putting on the table, rummaging through the drawers now. His face calm the first time since he entered the room. Eyes focused. "What if we wait for too long to look for a different solution only to be too late for Dean?"

"You don't know what the spell would do to you!" Bobby tries again.

At that, Cas looks up. "Well, technically, I do. It would turn me into a monster. Because that's the point, isn't it? Only the monsters can go to the Purgatory, so it makes sense if I become one, then I can go and find Dean."

"After you are dead! And we don't know if there is any way to change you back!" Bobby walks over, puts his hands on Cas's wrist, stopping him for a moment. "Goddamnit, can you stop and think for a second? Do you think Dean would want that?"

Cas stares back. "I don't know! I don't know what Dean would want because he's not here! Why don't you let me do this so I can ask him myself?"

Bobby snaps with more exhaustion. "How on earth did the Winchesters get that issue infected to you too? Just can't wait to sacrifice yourself for one another, you're just like their third brother now, you know that?"

Cas looks down at his hands. "I have to." is all he says.

Bobby loosens the grip, turning back to Sam. "You want to help me out there?"

Sam blinks. "For the record, I think the plan makes sense, reasonably speaking." At Bobby's stare, he hurriedly adds. "The 'only monsters can go to the Purgatory' part, I mean, there's indeed some more details we need to figure out."

Bobby squints at him, unbelievable. "Great, that makes me the weird one in the room. I'm gonna grab some drink then. You two knock yourself out doing... whatever you want to do, why do I bother saving your sorry asses."

He leaves the room, heading for the kitchen, probably.

<br>

The three ingredients on the list: demon blood, monster blood, and unholy man's blood -- the mixed blood that is so blasphemous that can turn the most holy thing to a monster.

Cas goes to fetch demon blood and monster blood, Sam says he'd take care of the last one.

They meet back at Bobby's in a few hours, each have jars of blood in hands. Bobby eyes them, both more bloody than before.

"Do I even want to know how did you get that human blood?" Bobby glances at Sam but looks away shortly.

"Probably not." Sam says, too easily.

Cas frowns. "Did you kill a man?"

Sam just hands him the jar. "Like I said, you probably don't want to know."

Cas looks at him for a few moments, then he averts the eyes. He doesn't ask further.

The mixture of the blood has a color so dark that it's more black than red. Cas enchants the spell as the black grimoire instructs. The blood still looks like blood, dirty and stinking. The smell of corruption and abomination.

They look at him.

"Cas, you sure about this? Like, really sure? This thing looks like no fun." Bobby frowns deep, all concerned.

"I'm doing this." Cas says, not really thinking about what the liquid smell like or what it would do to him, only the place with the bleachy sky and dying woods, a figure with torn shirt and flannel running in it, with only a blade in his hands, facing the whole world of monsters created from the beginning of the time, no way out, no rest, not even a damn soul to talk to. "I'm ready." He says, he can't be more ready.

"Alright then," Bobby pushes the jar towards him.

The dark surface of the mixed blood reflects his vessel's face -- the face he's wearing for so long that he already registers as his own. And soon, he may lose the form.

"You may not want to witness the next part." Castiel tells Bobby and Sam, grabs the syringe he prepared earlier, pumping the liquid into his own vein.

Bobby widens his eyes once more. "Thought drinking that thing is bad enough."

"Faster this way." Cas extracts a full drag of the blood and pumps them in, then next. Eyes locked on the needle, teeth grinded. His face grimaces.

Bobby hesitates at the threshold before heading out. "Call me if you need anything."

"I can stay." Sam offers.

Castiel just continues the motion until the jar is emptied.

And then he waits.

The boiling sensation starts from the arm, as the liquid touches his own blood, worse than the strongest acid and boiled metal pouring onto a human body. And it moves deeper into the system. Like a flash, it reaches the heart and pumps into every part of the body.

Castiel drops the syringe and screams. His body collapses to the floor, eyes wide open but he can't see anything, the world shifts in front of him in darkened color.

The sensation is so intense that the Leviathans' attacks in Purgatory are like nothing but tickles. It's not just pain, it's the transformation, it's like his blood wants to melt down his bone and flash, turning his inside out, mashing his gut and brain to mud.

Castiel squirms violently on the floor, yelling in a mixed sound of high pitch and all kinds of human languages, switching from one dead tongue to another, like a computer frantically blooding out random error messages under a virus attack.

His eyes and mouth lighten up, bright lights starts to flow but instead of leaving the body, the lights blink, on and off, on and off, until it dims, like a broken light bulb trying its best to lighten up one last time before it blows. The light is captured back inside the body, the same way they can't escape a black hole. Not even any grace can escape the change.

Sam stands by him, watching. Bobby rushes back in at the sound. But none of them can do anything or has any idea what is happening.

And that is only the beginning.

Castiel's body rises slowly in the air, his eyes half closed, as if half passing out, half dream walking. The lights in the room shakes, sounds of thunder rolling from above the ceiling. In the shadow of the flickering lights, there are the black wings, expanding from his shoulder blade, long and stretched, filling the whole room and beyond. The feathers on the wings shines black, the color of the night sky.

"Holy." Bobby gasps, taking a step back in awe. Sam stares.

And then the shape changes, the dark crimson color of blood crawls from his back, reaching the root of the wings, flowing upwards, distaining the feathers. Some fall to the floor, others shrink and twist like burned by fire. The bones holding the wings make cracking sound and bend back, folding inside, twisting into distorted shapes. The wings no longer look like wings, more like bewildering branches with charred leaves barely attached in the winter.

The screaming and yelling of pain dies down slowly, the sound pitch grow lower, less like human voice, more like wounded monster moaning in pained growl.

As the wings fold and twist, they no longer hold the weight of the body, Castiel crashes back down, landing on all fours. Claws and scales grow from fingers and skins, bones shifting, face unrecognizable. A mixed shape of a hundred different wild animals but no name for what Castiel looks like now.

Bobby takes another step back, reaching slowly for his gun. Sam reaching for the machete.

"Cas?" Bobby calls carefully, forcing the voice as untrembling as he can manage.

The monster in front of them gnarls, can't tell if it's answering or threatening. He looks up slowly, eyes glassy and foggy. With the slightest shade of blue.

"Cas," Sam takes a breath. "Nod if you are still in there and can hear us."

They watch intensely. And Castiel whines, then, nods once, slowly.

Bobby breathes out. "Good to know, thank God you're not dead in that whole --" he waves a hand to vaguely refer to whatever happened just now in place for a word he can never find. He clicks the safety bolt back on.

"Yet." Sam says.

"What?"

"Not dead, yet." Sam keeps his hunter's gait, hands still on the machete -- the same one he carried with into the vampire nest where Dean was killed. "Cas still needs to be dead to go to the Purgatory, remember?"

Bobby swallows, falling to silence. After a beat, "And you want to do the honor?"

"Unless you volunteer," Sam says, unbothered. "Don't see a third option here."

The worst thing is, he's right.

"And you're still onboard with this 'getting killed to go to the horror land' plan?" Bobby checks with Cas one last time.

The monster that was -- is -- Cas nods.

"This is absolutely the shittiest plan I've ever seen, and that includes two apocalypses." Bobby sighs deeply, looking at Cas truly apologetically, "I'm sorry." Then to Sam, "Just, don't do it in here, will ya?"

Sam nods once, gloomily.

<br>

Bobby does not follow them outside, and he thinks a bottle of whiskey is definitely not enough for tonight.

He doesn't need to see, the squeaky sound of footsteps and claws heading to the opening in the junkyard is loud and clear in the midnight silence.

He closes his eyes.

There is sound of metal cutting through flesh, and then something heavy falls to the ground.

One set of footstep head back, stepping on the ground that is more muddy wet than before.

Bobby shakes his head hard. "Cas you stupid love-blind idjit."

### Chap. 3

> **Outline:** Cas falls to Purgatory, finds Dean. Dean doesn't recognize him, monster Cas can't talk, too weak to change back. The two support/survive in Purgatory for a while, Cas eats souls to grow stronger and can heal. In an accident, Dean thinks monster Cas is gonna turn on him and attack, so he attacks Cas, hurt him, Cas turn back to normal shape the same time, they talk. Cas confesses all secrets he's hiding this year, Dean gets pissed, decides to go back outside first together
>
> (joke ref Beauty & Beast: Dean's kiss can break Cas's spell, making him back to normal form, purify the dirty blood in his system) (joke ref Twilight: Dean as vamp sucks the bad blood out from Cas's system)

Dean lingers not far from the same opening that he saw Cas for the briefest moment. Sometimes by the stream, sometimes on the edge of the closest woods, most of the times, just in the plain middle of the opening, without cover. It is a bad idea, actually, the worst one possible, to not move swiftly in a place like this.

Purgatory is the monster hunting ground, and stay put means food.

But Dean stays around there anyway. If the monsters come, he kills them. If the door opens again, he goes home. The logic simplifies to the simplest, Dean distantly wonders if his brain would degenerate for lack of use, but soon pushes it aside.

Leviathans still emerge once in a while, dropping in here and again like a recurring termite problem in an old house, though not as many as when Cas was here. Their faces shift between human vessel and the teethy face, decapitation is still the best solution Dean can manage. Not like there is any research book or anything else in the Purgatory he can use anyway.

He would have lost the concept of time entirely if it's not for his watch still ticking and running. But he doesn't know if it's a good thing or bad thing. Watching the fingers tick one second, then another second, slowly crawling forward, Dean thinks going lunatic is just a matter of time if he can't figure something out soon.

And he can't figure anything out.

The air never stirs in a way like when a portal opens, there is not lightened up exit, no jail visitor or bail release.

Sometimes, Dean even considers not killing some monsters on his way, keeping one as a pet or something, to at least have something to look at and talk to, however ugly they are. He understands why Robinson Crusoe keeps Friday on that island now.

And then, in the day that he loses count of which day, he is attacked by a dozen vampires in the same time. Sarcastically, he knows them all. From that nasty nest that started all this and sent him here.

He fights and kills and struggles and swings, taking down as many as he can but a small part of his brain already knows how this will play out, that piece of mind floats above him, viewing the scene unfold like a Deja Vu or a rewatched movie.

"I killed you once, don't mind do that again." The big boss vamp grins at him, showing the ugly fangs, knocking him down. Dean loses grip on the blade, pinned to the ground, all too similar to the first time.

Where does the monsters go after they die in the Purgatory? It's not the first time he wonders this, but this time he might actually go check it out himself.

And then, that vamp loses its head. Its body freezes, its hold on his throat loosens, and it falls frigidly down, not moving an inch anymore.

Dean looks up.

A large monster has the bit-off vampire head in between its teeth, the cutting edge where the neck should connect to the body is dripping blood between the creature's teeth. It sees him, hesitates, as if can't decide whether to spit that bloody head out or swallow it. It ends up swallowing it down in a gulp.

Dean jumps to his feet, blade ready, pointing at this new thing.

It's a huge creature, leaving long and stretching shadow on the ground as it walks, larger than Leviathans even. Dean has never seen anything like this before, dead or alive, has furs and scales and fangs all at once, a hybrid of so many different things. Large, but broken. Confusing, but powerful.

He steps back slowly as the monster walks towards him, also slowly, looking at him, opening its mouth. The teeth glinting with fresh blood. On its back, black twisted parts stood out, looking more like broken horns than wings.

Dean frowns at this thing, hunter's instinct kicking in, pulling and dragging him in two different directions. The blade is still dripping blood from the vamps he killed minutes ago, the instinct of continuing the action he's growing increasingly familiar with washes over his blood. It would be so easy, with such a twisted clumsy body and weird biological structure, he bets it couldn't move as fast as he does.

But then, there is something else in it that makes him pause. Looking. Observing. Asking question first and shooting second. Something about this monster, maybe it's the black wing-like structure on its back, maybe it's the slightly tan-colored body and the white blue front, or just the way it approaches him, the way it bites off the head of the vamp that almost killed him again, somehow he thinks it's not going to hurt him. It can be trusted. He thinks he must already lost his minds to think that for a whole new level of freak.

Dean circles it, checking out its side, its back, its shape. It stops, letting him, purring and moaning in a low grave sound. Not menacing, more like sad.

Dean notices it's wounded, badly. Not fatal, probably, but surely hurt like hell. There are teeth shaped wounds on its legs bleeding black and a round bullet shaped hole on its shoulder bleeding dark red. When it walks, the left paw steps shallower than the rest, he'd guess there are cuts there too.

The vampire part of him is still functioning. The metallic smell of blood too strong there is no way of ignoring. He sniffs. And the most confusing part is, the blood doesn't smell right. Human blood smells fragrant, vampire blood dull and dead, demon blood sour, Leviathans bitter. But this thing, it's like a drug store, with all kinds of bad smell mixed together flowing inside its vein, covering what was originally there.

"What are you?" Dean can't help asking.

The monster answers him in a low set of monstrous mumbling, presumably telling him things about itself but he hasn't the faintest idea of monster language.

"Alright, chill, pal." Dean tells it, walking two more steps closer to it, cautiously.

It's about within its attack range now, if it desires. Dean maintains the eye contact, waiting for a killer blow, thinking if the blade should target to its paw or head first if that happens.

But nothing happens. It holds the stare, looking back, looking straight. It barely blinks.

The feeling is strangely familiar.

"Okay, this is just getting weird." Dean chuckles, lowering the blade, shaking his head. "You just remind me of my best friend."

It purrs louder, voice tight and urgent.

Dean raises his brows. Then he tells it, "No, uh-uh, no way, I'm not gonna name you 'Cas' just because you want me to. What do you think Cas would feel if he knows?"

He ends up naming the creature "Cas."

*Cas might just find it hilarious, it would be good to see him laugh.* Dean reasons to himself, patting the creature gently on the back where the scales cover.
