[TOC]

### Chap. 1

> **Outline:** Dean gets killed when he's still vampire so he goes directly to purgatory, meets Benny there (?), fights together, tries to come back but neither can go through human portal (Sam still soulless the whole time)
>
> Cas goes desperate, blames himself, pushes Crowley/Alphas even further to find purgatory, finds rogue reaper Ajay, tries to go purgatory as angel but fail to leviathans (Naomi: took a lot angels to fetch Cas), decides to go as monster

### Chap. 2

> **Outline:** Cas turns himself to monster (disturbing form, distorted wings etc.), challenges Raphael with death wish, gets killed as he wants, goes to purgatory, finds Dean. Both not recognize the other at first, fight, almost kill each other

### Chap. 3

> **Outline:** Dean&Cas recognize each other because of slipping habits/catch phrase  that's too familiar (e.g. "son of a bitch"), wait for Ajay to pick up but Ajay is killed by Crowley/Alpha/Raphael, so no going back. Cas confesses all secrets he's hiding this year, Dean gets pissed, decides to go back outside first together

### Chap. 4

> **Outline:** Cas sees leviathans and everything, only way out is he juice up, so in order to bring Dean back, Cas absorbs souls in purgatory (tries best to avoid leviathans so stay sane mostly), blows up a hole in purgatory to push Dean out (heal him too, transform back to human again), tries to stay behind to keep everything in purgatory not escape by using his body as patch to the hole (and guilty for leaving Sam's soul behind, self-punish)

### Chap. 5

> **Outline:** Dean insists him out too or else he'll jump back in & they'll help fix Cas's leviathan problem, Cas complies finally, drooping leviathan ooze occasionally but mostly can hold them back, goes to hell, steals Sam's soul back and fixes him

### Chap. 6

> **Outline:** Cas fights Raphael with his leviathan part ("rock beats scissor, leviathan beats angel"), cancels out both problems (explodes, Dean freaks out, Cas survives), all problems solved, world in peace again
