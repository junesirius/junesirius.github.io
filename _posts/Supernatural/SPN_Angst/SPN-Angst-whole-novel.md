## Draft

### Claim info

#### Claim summary

Dean dies as a vampire and wakes up in Purgatory, trapped in the never-ending fight of killing and killed, hunting and hunted. Story of his life.

Cas is getting desperate. Going to the demons and monsters and reapers, willing to sacrifice anything to get down there and bring him back -- even if the cost is himself and there's no turning back. He turns himself into a monster and dies to go to Purgatory.

They find each other, and that's all they have in the relentless monsterland, being monsters themselves. They'll have to crawl their way out the ugly way, whatever the cost -- and Cas has to turn himself into something even worse.

#### Visual element

The color is mainly red and black, Dean covered in red, Cas in black. They're in a roughly built nest in Purgatory, Cas lies down, eyes closed, in a sleeping coma, clothes torn, wounds covered all over, broken wings on his back. Dean, with vampire fangs and bloodstains all over, leans in kissing him. There might be remains of other dead monsters or Leviathan goo around them on the ground.

### Posting

#### Posting summary

Aren't we all, monsters, in a way?

Some crawl out, some hide deep; some drink red, some bleed black.

In the pure, relentless monsterland, that's all they have -- being monsters themselves.

---

Died as a vampire and woke up in Purgatory with fangs, Dean has to crawl his way out the ugly way. And Castiel, in order to reach him, has to do something far, far worse -- to himself.

### Promo excerpt

Flashes of a blade shine in front of him, the teethy head flying up before dropping to the ground, rolling a few steps away, spilling a rain of black drops.

Castiel drags himself up, looking at the figure fighting off the creatures that are now starting to surround --

"Dean!" he cries out his name.

"Cas?" Dean answers automatically, looking in his direction, overjoyed, eyes sparkling.

But just that blink of distraction leaves enough of a fatal opening, the Leviathan he was fighting gets the jump on him, the multilayers of teeth opening wide, angling itself to bite down on Dean's shoulder. Dean is pinned to the ground, immobilized.

"NO!!" Castiel rages, eyes blazing bright. "Close your eyes!" he manages to shout at the last moment, can't see if Dean has covered his eyes or not, pouring his power onto that Leviathan that is going to hurt Dean. Castiel can't think or see anything else.

### Editing notes

~~Chap.1-3: change the narrative "Cas" → "Castiel" when he's morally grey/ambiguous and when Cas/Sam POV (can use "Cas" in narrative when Dean POV)~~

<br>

The Impala is parked in the back alley by the two-story building. The place doesn't have any lights on, but some of the windows are broken, the scent of copper and blood overflowing outside. One can only imagine how much blood must have been spilled inside the place for the outside to smell the same filth.

Sam and his grandfather hurry out of their van, rushing into the place, machete ready in their hands.

There are bodies without heads all the way from the stairs leading to the main hall. A long red carpet made of blood welcomes them.

Sam glances at the separated heads rolling around on the floor, seeing fangs dripping with blood. None of them move an inch anymore.

Samuel sees the same, catching his grandson's eyes, nodding at the only entrance leading to the larger opening. Both of them walk fast and quietly, in trained hunter steps.

The place is quiet. Too quiet. Even their silent footsteps might become the source of an echo.

And then, there is the sound of fighting again. Yelling and groaning, metal hitting metal, fists punching flesh.

They dash into the main ballroom. Sam tightens his grip on the machete.

Dean is covered in blood, his own or others' they do not know. The bigger vampire that bit him earlier has a smirk on his face, pulling Dean's collar and throwing him flying across the room like he weighs nothing. Dean lets out an angry growl, rolling on the ground in time to dodge a fierce direct blow to the face, grabbing the knife he dropped and jumping back on his feet, circling the other vampire, eyes bloody, pupils dilated, fangs out.

Sam hesitates. Samuel eyes him.

"Don't want to hurt Dean by accident," Sam whispers, not moving an inch closer, just standing there, watching them with white knuckles around the machete.

Dean ducks and dodges for two or three more rounds, before getting wrestled and tripped by the other vampire, legs entangled, unable to move easily. That monster is so much stronger than him. And by the look of the fight, the way he swings his arms and fists, several hundred years of living isn't teaching him nothing.

Dean can't breathe, fingers fumbling on the face of the bigger man, scratching the edge of his eye sockets, leaving bloody fingernail marks, but the other monster does not back away. Dean's movements slow, arms slumping to the ground eventually.

The other vampire lets the grip loose, Sam catches the break and marches forward, but he's still two steps too far away when the vampire dives back with the silver knife Dean left behind, cutting his head off in a clean move. Sam's machete slides through the vampire's throat right in the next second.

Two heads roll away from their bodies, blood spilling everywhere, mostly on Sam's face.

Sam flinches sharply, staring at the heads and bodies, gasping loudly. "Dean!"

Dean's eyes are still wide open, amber green, reflecting the shifting colors of the colored glass windows on the high ceiling. And then the lights go out. The fangs are still out, ugly, layering over his own teeth.

So much for going out swinging.

So much for half-retiring and apple-pie life.

"Oh my God!" Sam kneels down by his brother's body, hands on his shoulder, inhaling heavily.

Samuel looks away, swallowing hard.

Sam helps him close the eyes. And knits his head back to his body, later. With floss.

He burns his brother's body on a pyre. And then drives away in his car.

The town is left behind in the rearview mirror.

Soon, the whole state of Illinois is left behind miles away.

The vampire nest was set on fire before they left. Any other bodies or signs of life are all burned to ashes.

<br>

Dean wakes up in a gasp, touching his neck reflexively. The skin on his neck is intact, his head is still connected to his body.

"What the hell?" He looks around. The sky is grey, the trees all half dying around him. The whole place creeps him out, but the most creepy thing is, he seems to be still kicking and running.

He touches his upper gum. The fangs are still pointy, mostly hidden, for now.

"Okay? So not dead, but still a fucking vamp," He mutters to himself, disgusted.

Eyeing around again, his hunter's instinct kicks in just in time. His fingers fumble to the back of his belt, finding nothing but air. His body moves before his ears catch the sound -- something jumps on him from behind.

Dean twists around, elbowing it in the face, arms wrapping its neck from behind, pressing his full weight on its throat until it stops moving. Dean drops the body and recognizes the face of a young boy -- the young vampire boy he sure as hell cut the head off no more than a few hours ago, before he somehow got sent into this weird land.

"You're dead." Dean frowns at the motionless -- dead before, probably just passed out now -- vampire body, thinking aloud. Realization dawns on him. "Which means I'm dead too. Goddammit!"

Dean kicks the trunk of a tree closest to him with all his force, frustrated. "Fuck!"

It's just a vampire case, an everyday job. He did not expect to check out just like that. Not today. But apparently he did.

He kicks again, as if it could make him feel better. "So what? This is some monsterland dead vamps go to for the afterparties and I'm stuck here forever?"

No one answers his question, except for some more creatures lurking closer because of the noise.

Seems like it's more than just vampires then, Dean concludes, thinking he sees something that definitely looks like a werewolf and another like a wendigo. Every freaking monster he and his brother and every hunter has ever killed would be here then. And if they remember him in the whatever afterlife memory they still carry, they sure as hell would be thrilled to see him hanging around with them.

That's when he picks a direction, and starts running into the creepy woods. The growls and howling of every kind of monster that ever existed rise around him like the most dedicated freaky monster symphony.

He has nothing but his hands and feet. And his fangs -- weirdly comforting now, come to think of it.

It's gonna be a bloody long eternity.

<br>

Sam is two states over when Cas drops by.

The case looks like an angelic weapon case. Sam calls for him in a prayer. People are being killed for telling the truth.

"Looks like it's your department?" Sam points at a picture of Gabriel's Horn of Truth when the angel shows up.

Castiel flies away and back in two seconds. Nothing angelic in the town, he tells him.

Sam snorts. "Where did you look?"

"Everywhere." Castiel looks him in the eyes, then looks around. It's a single-bed motel room, the bedsheet on the only bed unruffled. One duffel bag on the ground.

"Where is your brother?" Cas frowns.

"Dean's dead," Sam tells him, flat.

"What?!" Castiel snaps. "You prayed for me for a possible horn but didn't think of letting me know that Dean's dead?"

Sam looks at him, also frowning. "What's there to pray for if he's already gone?"

Cas opens his mouth, in disbelief, wetting his lips, but not saying anything. He shakes his head, walking several steps away, his back to Sam.

"How?" His voice is low and grave.

"Vampires," Sam says, emotionless. "It was a vampire nest. We went in there too late. Dean killed most of them but got taken down by the largest one. I killed it after it got Dean."

"You let Dean go into a vampire nest all by himself? Without backup?" Cas turns around, furious.

"Dean volunteered," Sam says it like it's obvious.

"And why would he do such a stupid thing?" Cas's eyes narrow.

"Because he's a vampire himself."

That is the ultimate bomb drop.

Castiel stares at him, eyes widened in extreme shock -- if Sam didn't know better, he'd say Cas almost looks horrified, if angels can ever feel horror.

And then with the sound of wings flapping, Castiel is gone.

Sam goes back to the case.

<br>

Heaven is heavily guarded, these days. With Raphael's troops and his loyalists. Castiel's army is on the far periphery of Heaven, still assembling but far too few in number and power. Going into the private chamber area where the souls are secured is nothing short of a suicide mission. He goes anyway.

Sneaking into the white corridor bathed in blinding light from all directions, he looks for the names on the doors. With everyone that has a last name "Winchester", he finds John and Mary, he finds Henry, their distant cousins from other branches, unrelated people who share the same last name. But there is no Dean. In all human history, with all the humans named "Winchester", there is no "Dean" in Heaven, born 1979, died 2010. Not in John and Mary's chamber, not anywhere.

"What's the matter, lost your little human pet?" A patrol angel spots him, approaching. Raphael's man.

Castiel slides his angel blade into grip, ready to fight. The angel throws himself at him, young and inexperienced. Castiel stabs his blade out, right into his heart. The angel bursts into bright light and collapses into nothing but a pile of meat suit.

Castiel sighs, eyeing the corridor that doesn't have the person he came looking for one last time, picking up the blade and rushing to the other side.

More patrols hear the noise, gathering in this direction. He has to leave the place in a rush.

<br>

Crowley is not happy to see him. Not at all, to say the least.

"Why are you here again?" He's halfway poking a monster's brain, electrical pod in his gloved hand, blood stains on his apron.

"I need to find the Purgatory. NOW!" Castiel snaps.

"Great! That makes the two of us." Crowley makes his voice sound cheerful. "Then why don't you go ahead with your quest or whatever and bring me more Alphas, we'll figure that out soon."

Castiel takes two steps forward, right in front of Crowley, almost nose to nose growling into his face. "You don't understand. Soon is not enough, I need it NOW!"

Crowley eyes him curiously. "What's the rush? Already the checkmate time upstairs?"

Castiel looks away.

"Not the war then." Crowley reads his face. "Then must be the Winchesters. What, they have a sudden interest in the place as well or something?"

Cas shifts uneasily, moving farther away, fluttering. "No."

"My my, can't be one of them already gone there, can they?" Crowley makes an exaggerated tsk. "No wonder you can't wait a single second. Always too fond of those two you can't focus on anything now, are you?"

Cas glares at him, snapping harshly. "Yes! Dean's there! Okay? Satisfied?"

The demon hums, definitely sounding like he's enjoying himself too much. "All the more reasons to poke around the Alphas, don't you think? Chop, chop, Feathers, don't want to make your boyfriend wait down there for too long."

Castiel thins his lips, lines tight. "Do you have more information from your side?" His head tilting towards that little creature Crowley tied to the stretcher.

The demon casually gives it a shock as he speaks, the monster moans at the electric strike. Crowley listens to the sound like it's music. "Nothing yet. I'll drop a line when I find anything --"

"Good." Castiel cuts in. Within a blink, he flies away.

Crowley puffs out a laugh. "Talk about motivations."

<br>

#### Act 2 Ext. Purgatory (Dean; monsters); multiple (Cas; alpha vamp, Ajay)

> (Dean POV → Cas POV)
>
> Dean fights, tries to come back but can't go through human portal
>
> Cas finds rogue reaper Ajay, goes purgatory as angel

Dean is so tired. His body does not wear out, but his mind is way too overloaded.

He doesn't know the days and nights. There is no sun or moon, there is no time. There is just hunting and hunted, chasing and chased, killing and killed.

His mind is blurred with the repetition of the same sets of movements -- being attacked from all directions, individually or in groups, at once or in turns, monsters of all kinds, then his body goes into autopilot mode. He doesn't need to think much about any movement, and given time, the monsters would all become a pile of flesh and blood by his feet. Sometimes even he is surprised himself that he's the last one left standing. He staggers away from the slaughterhouse, moving to the next.

Call it survival instinct or whatever, he's fighting his ass out of here.

There must be a way out. Dean tells himself.

If the past thirty years of living this life have taught him anything, it's the fact that any problem can have a solution. And now he has a problem -- stuck in this monsterland afterlife as a vampire, so he just has to find a solution to leave here and fix himself. And hopefully, fix Sam too.

The last glint of memory flashes by and he sees Sam's face twitching as he was bitten, and later, as he was being killed.

And fix Cas too, now that he really thinks about it. There is definitely something wrong with Cas too -- without seeing the angel for almost a year, the things he said about not having the luxury of caring about torturing a kid, or caring about anything, really. Whatever that angel civil war thing is, Cas has changed. They'll figure that out too, together. Once he's back in the game.

God, so many problems.

Dean waves the new bone blade he just snatched from a dead vampire, feeling its weight in his hands, sensing some comfort in having a real weapon finally.

"Okay," he tells himself, "one thing at a time then."

He spots a stream at the edge of the woods, and starts following it, moving downstream.

<br>

As it turns out, if an angel really puts their mind into hunting, they can be a damn good hunter -- the best hunter in the world that a hunter could ever be, actually.

The vicious things give off a dark vibe, not as evil as demons, but also stink so much that they differ from humans. Castiel can sense them, pick them out from the crowd like peas from rice. He drags random werewolves, shapeshifters, vampires, or djinns out of their nests. Sometimes he drops them at Crowley's lab; other times, he fries their brains himself when reading their minds.

He doesn't have the luxury of taking things slowly now, Castiel tells himself. Every minute wasted on Earth, every minute spent talking to a monster when he can just reach inside and read, he thinks of Dean in Purgatory, being hunted and chased by millions of monsters. He thinks of Dean trapped there, alone, as a vampire, and dying.

Castiel's eyes glow with blue-white light, the two vampires in front of him vaporize in an instant. They don't know anything about Purgatory or their Alpha anyway, or if they do, they refuse to give him up. Castiel decides they aren't worth his patience.

"I think that's far enough, Angel." A low male voice sounds behind him.

Castiel turns around, the grace in his eyes barely receding. He has the angel blade ready.

The man has a strong build, decent suits and outfits -- at first glance, he could fit perfectly into some upper-class gathering, drinking afternoon tea and talking horse racing with fancy ladies and gentlemen of Old Britain. Except the tea is probably made of human blood. Castiel can see the fangs just as clearly as he can see the man's skin and clothes.

"Alpha vampire," Castiel says, the closest thing to a greeting.

"You killed enough of my children." The vampire speaks in a slow, almost elegant tone -- the tone of someone who has been living for centuries. "I understand you want to schedule an appointment."

"Where is Purgatory?" Castiel asks, the only thing he cares about.

"Why would you want to know?" the Alpha vampire asks, almost politely.

But Castiel's patience is wearing thin. He takes a few steps closer. "Would you believe me if I say it's actually to save a friend? One who's been turned into one of you?"

The thought of Dean being a vampire hurts just as much as knowing he's in Purgatory. Cas thinks, almost winces at the thought, but makes sure it doesn't show. He shuts that train of thought off. They'll figure that out later, once he finds the place and finds him.

"Dean Winchester, is it?" The Alpha studies his face. Castiel keeps his expression straight. As much as the uneasiness of being scrutinized, he holds his face blank, staring back at the vampire.

"So you know him," Castiel says as an answer.

"Not just know him. I saw through his mind as he saw through mine," the vampire states flatly.

That makes Castiel squint. He tilts his head. "What do you mean?"

The Alpha vampire smiles. "Our minds -- think of it as a hive. I can feel all of my children, no matter where they are, and they can feel me. So when Dean was one of us, he was no exception."

"Was?" Cas can't help noticing.

"Purgatory isn't exactly a signal-covered zone, you might say."

Castiel swallows, pushing down hard on the thoughts that Dean might be dead -- that's why the connection breaks, dead even in the afterlife, dead in every sense -- pushing away the contemplation of where he would go next. He doesn't have time for this sick twisting feeling curling low in his stomach. He pushes it all down to the bottom.

Castiel raises his angel blade higher, standing in a more menacing stance. "Do you know how to get there?"

"I might," the vampire says, unshaken by the killing look in the angel's eyes or his blade, knowing far too well how negotiation and leverage usually work.

"And?" Castiel tries hard not to sound too desperate but fails.

"While I can't take you there personally, I know someone who can. It's no problem." The vampire looks him in the eyes, grinning wider. "Now, shall we talk terms?"

It is not a good deal, technically. Castiel knows that too well, and so does the Alpha vampire. But he gets what he needs, so he gives the monster what he asks for -- not to hurt any other vampires like he did before, in exchange for a name that hopefully is the real deal and knows the pathway to Purgatory.

Castiel gives him his word. "But I can't promise other hunters will do the same, the vampires would still get killed."

The Alpha shrugs. "A few of you kill a few of us, some of my children feed on some humans -- that's called balance. That's nature. Only what you were doing -- wiping out the board to get to me -- that's something I cannot allow. I have to protect my children, that you must understand."

Castiel does not answer.

They part ways.

<br>

The taxi driver is sitting in the driver's seat of a yellow cab, reading a newspaper, parked in a back alley in Warsaw, Missouri. Castiel knocks on the window.

"Ajay?"

The man looks up. "You know my name."

"And what you do." Castiel gives him a sharp look.

"What, you want a ride?" Ajay glances back, gesturing at the glowing "taxi" sign on top of the car.

"A ride, yes, but going down." Castiel says plainly, "To Purgatory. Reapers have the way, and rogue ones do that for a profit. Like you."

Ajay steps out of the car, eyeing him up and down. "And why would an angel want to go to Purgatory?"

"That is my business," Castiel states flatly.

Ajay shrugs. "Sure. And if you get killed down there, also not my business. Not exactly having insurance around here."

Castiel nods. "I understand. One ticket down, two tickets up. How does that work?"

Ajay raises an eyebrow. "I didn't say I'd do that yet. What's your payment?"

Castiel frowns. "What do you want?"

The rogue reaper curls his lips. "A little fuel in stock would be nice, just in case some days I need it, as good as human souls."

Castiel glares at him. "You want my grace?"

"Not all of it. Just a tiny bit. You'll grow back, won't you?" The slimy reaper conjures a small glass vial into his palm, holding it out. "So, do we have a deal?"

It's not a large vial, to be honest, but still, losing grace -- trading it -- is unholy. There are so many spells others could cast with the grace he gives away to harm him, or even kill him. And if Ajay is corrupted by Raphael and this is his way of getting to him, then...

But Dean is waiting. Cas's mental image shifts. Dean has been in Purgatory for so long, and if he doesn't reach him soon, if he's too late, then... death in the afterlife -- Would that mean gone forever? That he would never see him again?

Castiel grabs the vial and uses the angel blade to cut his left forearm. The sparkling light of grace flows from the wound, filling the small glass container. His human body inhales automatically at the prickling pain.

He covers the wound with his other palm once the vial is full. The skin is healed in an instant, but the loss of grace still makes him stumble slightly, as if his legs can't quite hold his weight for a moment, or his head becomes too heavy and dizzy -- not unlike a human losing just enough blood to be lightheaded before turning vital.

He hands the vial back, ignoring the uncomfortable sensation.

"Lead the way," he tells him sternly.

<br>

#### Act 3 Ext. Purgatory (Dean, Cas)

> (Dean POV → Cas POV)
>
> Cas goes to purgatory with Ajay's deal, see Dean briefly, attacked by too many leviathans (Naomi: took a lot angels to fetch Cas)
>
> both of them save each other against leviathans, Cas wants Dean out, but Dean buys him time to let Cas out of the same portal, Dean left behind in Purgatory facing monsters again

The end of the stream leads to an opening. The woods are sparse. The water looks clean -- cleaner, relatively speaking.

Dean drops to his knees to scoop up some of the clear liquid to drink. The coolness washes down the dirt in his gullet, making him breathe easier. He washes his face and hands too, but doesn't bother cleaning all the other blood stains on his clothes or skin.

In the reflection, Dean sees a face he can barely recognize, with stubble covering his jaw, dark bags around his eyes, bruises and cuts here and there. And the fangs, the ugly uneven fangs that jut out, visible whenever he opens his mouth, refusing to contract however hard he demands his body to. Dean slaps the water surface to break the image, to not have to look at that face again -- the face of a monster he and his family have devoted to killing.

He leaves the water's edge, heading toward the middle of the opening where, according to some of the old creatures he killed earlier, there would sometimes be a disturbance in the air flow. No one here knows where the stir comes from, but if Dean has to guess, this is where the veil is the weakest.

If a long shot is all he can get, then Dean would take it. He walks toward the said location, waving his blade at the nothingness in the empty air, observing, thinking, waiting. The air is unmoved, but his gut is giving him a drag, the hair on the back of his head rising -- some weird vamp hyper-sense or whatever it is, Dean's expecting something or someone approaching.

Dean stares at the middle of the ground hard, blade in hand, counting his own pounding heartbeat. Waiting.

<br>

The back alley where the taxi is parked is connected directly to a small opening surrounded by four painted walls. The drawings are wild and overly colorful, dizzying and frantic. Looking at them for too long might make one's head ache if one were human. Castiel looks at them for a moment and then looks away.

"You have thirty minutes. I'll see you where I drop you. Don't miss the ride, alright?" Ajay gives him a sly grin, starting the ritual without waiting for an answer.

The air swirls, sand and dust rising from the ground, creating a small sandstorm. In front of him, the wall painting comes alive, opening up and swallowing him whole.

In the blink of an eye, the surroundings shift. The walls and streets disappear into bleak woods and a grey sky. Monsters growl in the distance. Except --

They're not really in the distance.

Black smoke drops to the ground around him like debris from an asteroid crashing onto a planet. Creatures with no face but all teeth emerge from the smoke, surrounding him and shrinking the circle fast.

"What?--" That is the only syllable Castiel manages to make before the attacking begins.

They are fast, and strong. So strong even as an angel he can't match their strength. Castiel is thrown into the air by this one and that, sharp black teeth sinking into his flesh. He does not know if it's his vessel or his grace that is being devoured. He screams in pain and feels his strength draining rapidly.

"We are Leviathans." One of them enjoys too much in its feast on him, it actually bothers to answer his question.

Castiel gasps in disbelief. The pre-Biblical monsters that could devour every living thing that ever existed from the Creation, devour a whole planet and maybe even the entire worlds if they have the chance -- God had to create a whole Purgatory to lock them away. He has heard of them like a rumor story Balthazar would talk about when he was in a good storytelling mood, but Castiel never thought they were more than a story. And now, he's in the center of their dinner table.

For a split second, Castiel thinks this might be his way of dying -- his true and final death. Becoming the shared food of the Leviathans, without having a chance of finding Dean or saving him from this place. His gut twists. Cas focuses all his attention on the scrap of grace he has left, trying -- thinking -- about exploding himself one last time just to get rid of these filthy creatures that live in the same dimension as Dean. That is when he feels the grips and teeth on his body loosen.

Flashes of a blade shine in front of him, a teethy head flying up before dropping to the ground, rolling a few steps away, spilling a rain of black drops.

Cas hauls himself upright, looking at the figure fighting off the creatures that are now starting to surround --

"Dean!" he cries out his name unbelievably.

"Cas?" Dean answers automatically, looking in his direction, overjoyed, eyes sparkling.

But just that blink of distraction leaves enough of a fatal opening, the Leviathan he was fighting gets the jump on him, layered teeth opening wide, angling itself to bite down on Dean's shoulder. Dean is pinned to the ground, immobilized.

"NO!!" Castiel rages, eyes blazing bright. "Close your eyes!" he manages to shout at the last moment, can't see if Dean has covered his eyes or not, pouring his power onto that Leviathan that is going to hurt Dean. Castiel can't think or see anything else.

When the light fades, Dean pants heavily. The Leviathans are still there, even more than before. The one bearing Cas's angelic rage backs off a few steps, but it doesn't seem to be hurt, not fatally anyway. It spreads its hideous jaws, laughing wide and ugly. Its voice as sharp as its teeth, and it says, smirkingly, "Rock beats scissors, Leviathan beats angel."

There is no way they can defeat them, no way to even get a head start to run away from them long enough to reach the rendezvous point the rogue reaper promised.

"Dean!" Cas is desperate, doesn't even have time to check if Dean is hurt. His vision is blocked by more apparently irritated Leviathans attracted by the light show. There is no way he can make it out alive, the monsters are obviously more interested in him than anything else, but Dean, if Dean can make it to the rendezvous point, then maybe --

"Dean! You have to go! I'll distract them! The -- the ride is coming soon --" The attacks already resume, the angel blade is doing very little, more teeth and black goo sinking into his flesh and bones, Castiel screams in his true voice.

<br>

The yell of pain is the first thing that catches Dean's attention. The familiar trench coat comes next.

The black smoke turns into monsters he's never seen before, all teeth and no face, the ugliest bastards one can ever imagine. But luckily, it seems beheading does the trick, just like all the other creatures in this place -- at least temporarily.

Cutting his way through the tightening ring, he sees Cas. Being torn apart alive, shredded by the teeth. Blood and grace spilling from the wounds, he can't even tell what's the vessel and what's the angel.

Cas.

For that blink of time, emotions pour into him so fast Dean's almost dizzy with feelings, his steps stumble for the briefest instant, then he immediately aims the blade towards the closest uglyass thing.

Adrenaline pumping in his temple, blade rising and falling, heads rolling, black blood splattering, it almost becomes mechanical.

"Cas." Dean breathes out the name, looking him up and down, overwhelmed by the joy of seeing him again. But there is no time for catching up, no time for a single word to say how damn glad he is to see him, and also how pissed he is that these uglyass things showed up and sticking around the moment Cas appeared, and now they are in a bigger mess than handling wolves and vamps.

When he is pinned to the ground, watching the black goo dripping onto his face and the teeth of the monster ready to take a bite on him, with the last bit of strength, Dean casts one last glimpse at Cas, who actually seems okay and meets him in the eyes -- the eyes so deep and pained he loses the ability to read what's in them. Despite the fresh bleeding wounds and cuts on his face and body, he can still straighten up and walk over. Alive. Cas is okay. Dean tries to pull a smile at him, only to see his eyes filled with the familiar bright color. He shuts his eyes just in time. The pressure on top of him releases.

But it is not over -- it is far from over. The monsters back off briefly, but they do not leave. Immune to angel power even, apparently. They took the divine wrath like a bear to a pebble thrown onto its head.

Circling around them only to look for the next opportunity to attack -- they even seem to be intelligent enough to be strategic. Monsters with brains, for fuck's sake. There is no way the both of them can get out of here alive. And he's not going to let Cas "be the distraction" as he said. Not again.

The air in the opening flares not too far away from them. Even closer to the full circle of the Leviathans.

"Dean! You HAVE to go now!" Cas's voice is mixed with the shrieking high pitch of unrecognizable frequencies and human words.

"I'm not leaving without you!" Dean shouts back, fighting his way towards the angel.

The blade cuts through the monsters, leaving bodies tumbling around them, but they're gluing back together and catching up fast. The one that still has its teeth on Cas's leg, Dean makes sure it gets chopped into even smaller chunks, and kicks its body far away.

"Come on! I got you!" He hauls Cas up, slinging his arm over his shoulder, rushing toward the lighted exit.

And then he stumbles, feeling a pull on his own legs -- a monster is dragging him back. Dean loses balance and falls to the ground, but they're so close now. Within two steps to the exit at most, he shoves Cas forward.

"No, Dean!" That is the last of Cas's voice he catches before the lights are out. No more exits.

Dean lets out a long breath. At least one of them is out.

Turning around to face the monsters on his tail, he raises his bone blade that is as long and sharp as their teeth.

Dean creeps a smile. "Game time?"

(**Warning words** before the chapter: Body horror and minor grotesque content)

<br>

Castiel tumbles onto the cement ground, his body crashing onto the concrete of the real world. His mind takes a second to register.

He looks behind him frantically. But there is just air, walls, the stillness of a small town's back-alley. Earth.

No dying tree, no monster, no Dean.

"No, no, no, no, no!" Castiel gets to his feet, fists punching the brightly painted wall, as if it can tear apart the bricks to reveal the opening again. As if Dean is waiting right on the other side of the wall.

"You have to take me back again, Ajay!" he calls out behind him.

"I don't think Ajay can take you anywhere now." The voice makes his blood cold. Castiel looks back, realizing belatedly the whole place's air is buzzing with an archangel's power. The street lamps overhead flicker once and blow up.

"Raphael." Castiel turns around slowly, his back pressed against the wall. Cornered.

Raphael is in a female vessel this time, the woman's body a few inches shorter than him. But the true form behind that vessel's face is still gigantic and blindingly bright.

Castiel reaches inward, testing his grace. The fuel in the tank is so low that he can barely feel it, the energy flowing sluggishly like he's trying to fetch out the last drop of water in a bottle. Zero chance this time then.

Raphael steps towards him, looking up at his face. The vial with his essence that he gave Ajay not long ago is in her grip, his grace swirling gently inside the glass, soft and bright. The rogue reaper's body is limp by his cab on the ground, eyes burned out. Two other angels stand by the body.

"You killed him." Castiel shifts his eyes from the body back to the archangel, thinking hard, buying time.

"Thanks to you." Raphael shakes the vial slowly, the grace inside spinning faster like a tiny whirlpool. "This is beyond stupid even for you, Castiel. I'm disappointed, to be honest. I wasn't expecting you to be so... reckless. But in the end, daring to fight against me already tells as much."

His vessel's heart pounds hard and fast inside his chest. Is he human enough now for the sigil to work as he wants? Cas wonders, feeling the throbbing pain in the tears on his legs and over the whole body, wetness dripping from the wound. He takes the bet. The angel blade slides into his palm behind his back.

"What are you going to do to me?" he looks at the archangel, questioning, not letting his eyes blink, not showing any fear that the other might be looking for.

"Kill you, of course." Raphael is only two steps away now. "I don't see God or Balthazar or any of your monkey pets helping you this time. I'll kill your beloved Winchesters, too, rest assured."

Cas swallows reflexively, at the bare mention of the word "Winchester". His thought drifts away to the look Dean threw at him right before he pushed him out, letting himself be pulled away by the monsters, facing all the Leviathans by himself. Oh God. Cas winces.

Raphael must notice that. The female face shows a slight hint of joy. "Feeling the fear now, finally? A little too late for that." The archangel raises her blade. "Goodbye, Castiel."

Cas ducks aside, showing the angel banishing sigil he was drawing on the wall with his own blood while talking. Pressing his palm to the center of the sigil, it brightens up, blasting Raphael and the other two followers away. The blast gives Cas a small heated burn on the side of his body that is closest to the wall, but that is all it does.

The small alley returns to darkness and silence like there were never any angels there. Castiel leans back against the bloody wall, slumping slightly, rubbing his own eyes, ignoring the dripping blood from the sliced palm.

Dean is still in Purgatory, he is exhausted and low in grace, and the only being that can smuggle him into Purgatory is dead. He needs a plan, but he can't think of one.

Castiel opens his eyes, looking up at the sky that is darkening slowly as the night falls, desperate. Almost like how a human would pray. Dean would know what to do if he were here, he always could think of something. A next step, a joke to cheer up the team, an idea, something.

What would Dean do?

Cas gets an idea.

<br>

#### Act 2 Int. Bobby's house - Night (Cas, Bobby, Sam)

> (Cas → Bobby POV)
>
> Cas turns himself to monster (disturbing form, distorted wings etc.), death wish for sacrifice, gets killed by Sam as he wants, goes to purgatory

Cas appears in the middle of Bobby's living room. Bobby jumps, almost shoots him with the gun by his hand. And Sam actually does, from far across the room on the couch. The bullet pierces through his shoulder, flying out the other side, sinking into the wall behind him.

"Sam?!" Cas gasps in pain, staggering back two steps from the impact. Blood streams down from the new wound.

Bobby rushes to him.

"Sorry, panicked," Sam says, stuffing the gun back into his belt.

"You need to wear a bell next time," Bobby says, now standing in front of him, eyeing the wound that is making his coat a mess.

The comment actually pulls Cas's lip up a tiny little bit. "Dean said that too."

The bullet hole remains a hole under close inspection. Looking back into the angel's eyes, Bobby's frown deepens, "Why ain't it healed yet?"

Cas presses a palm on the shoulder, vainly trying to stop the burning and pungent sensation, but it does nothing, blood seeping through his fingers. More exhausted than before, he starts to think it might have been a bad idea to come here. "My grace, I'm drained," he has to admit.

"You were in a fight?" Sam asks.

"Not just any fight."

Cas tells them about Purgatory, and Ajay, and Raphael. He manages to leave out the parts with the Alpha and Crowley, deciding it's unimportant. Bobby helps wrap his shoulder and the worst wounds on his legs with some bandage and Cas says thank you.

"Wow." Sam blinks at his eventful afternoon.

"I know." Cas looks down, sinking into a chair by Bobby's dining table, resting his wounded arm on the armrest.

"No, I mean, you actually went to Purgatory for Dean?" Sam looks amazed. "Not even I would think of something crazy like that, I don't think anyone ever would."

"Well, maybe you should!" Cas stares at him. "He's your brother, and he needs our help."

Sam's face is unmoved. Cas squints. "What happened to you? You used to care about Dean a lot more."

Sam shrugs. "Nothing." Then, he returns the stare. "What happened to you, Castiel? You used to care about Dean a lot less."

Cas looks away, uneasy, eyes lingering on the window half covered by the flowing curtain. It's all dark outside now. Is Purgatory darker at night or would the sky there remain the same lifeless bleach and grey forever? When was the last time Dean saw sunlight?

"Seems like you two just balanced out then," Bobby comments behind them. Sam huffs a laugh, Cas does not.

"I just want to fix this," Cas says, voice quieter. He didn't tell them every single detail about the monsters and Leviathans, and how Dean looked during that brief moment they met down there. The hunter's eyes flashed with relief and were shortly covered by anger again. Cas soaks himself in the image and the look.

"What happened to 'The dead should stay dead' and not upsetting the natural order?" Sam raises his brows.

Cas drags his thought back, feeling the bone-deep exhaustion and pained sensation all over him numbing and spreading, sprawling like needles across every inch of muscle and skin. Do humans always feel like this when they are hurt? Does Dean?

"It's... he's just in another place. We can still bring him back." This is what Cas manages to land on. Not exactly an answer, but hopefully it's enough.

"Listen, Angel, I want Dean back as much as you do," Bobby chimes in. "But how? You said yourself, there ain't no elevator going down there and no more taxi driver to help. Any genius idea now?"

"I was hoping to find some answer here." Cas looks at the old hunter, pointedly.

Bobby blinks. "I ain't get nothin'."

Castiel nods at the mountainous books on the floor and on the shelves. "Your books might."

<br>

Cas pauses on a page, reading it over, and rereading it. His fingers rub the corner of the yellowed page belonging to a black grimoire.

He stands up and walks towards the cabinet where Bobby keeps most of his spell ingredients and pots and pans. The other two men look up from their books.

"Find anything you want to share with the class?" Bobby's eyes follow his steps.

Cas doesn't answer, just walking closer to the cabinet. His steps are still slightly shaky, the bandage over the gash on his calf leaks hints of black, the one on his shoulder red. He reaches the top shelf with his uninjured hand.

Bobby grabs the book that Cas was reading. Cas already knows what he's going to hear.

"Are you out of your mind? You'd be a damn fool even *think* about doing THAT?!" Bobby snaps, passing the book to Sam.

"Figured you might say that." Cas doesn't stop moving, not looking back.

"Then you know how stupid this is! Cas, come on, there gotta be another way."

"What if there *is* no other way?" Cas grabs three jars the size of vases, sets them on the table, and starts rummaging through the drawers. His face is calm for the first time since he entered the room. Eyes focused. "What if we wait too long looking for a different solution only to be too late for Dean?"

"You don't know what the spell would do to you!" Bobby tries again.

At that, Cas looks up. "Technically, I do. It would turn me into a monster. Because that's the point, isn't it? Only monsters can go to Purgatory, so it makes sense if I become one, then I can go and find Dean."

"After you are dead! And we don't know if there is any way to change you back!" Bobby walks over, putting his hands on Cas's wrist, stopping him for a moment. "Goddammit, stop and think for a sec, will ya? Do you think Dean would want that? You, become a monster?"

Cas glares back. "I don't know! I don't know what Dean would want because he's not here! Why don't you let me do this so I can ask him myself?"

Bobby snaps with more exhaustion. "How on earth did the Winchesters get that issue infected you too? Just can't wait to sacrifice yourself for one another, you're just as bad as their third brother now, maybe even worse, you know that?"

Cas looks down at his hands. "I have to." That's all he says.

Bobby loosens his grip, turning back to Sam. "You wanna help me out here or what?"

Sam blinks. "For the record, I think the plan makes sense, reasonably speaking." At Bobby's stare, he hurriedly adds, "The 'only monsters can go to Purgatory' part. I mean, there's indeed some more details we need to figure out."

Bobby squints at him, unbelievably. "Great, that makes me the weird one in the room. I'm gonna grab some drink then. You two knock yourself out doing... whatever you wanna do, why do I bother saving your sorry asses."

He leaves the room, heading for the kitchen.

<br>

The three ingredients on the list: demon blood, monster blood, and unholy man's blood -- the mixed blood so blasphemous it could turn the most holy being into a monster.

Castiel goes to fetch demon blood and monster blood, Sam says he'd take care of the last one.

They meet back at Bobby's after a few hours, each with jars of blood in hand. Bobby eyes them, both more bloody than before.

"Do I even want to know how you got that human blood?" Bobby glances at Sam but looks away shortly.

"Probably not," Sam answers too quickly.

Cas frowns. "Did you kill a man?"

Sam just hands him the jar. "Like I said, you probably don't want to know."

Cas looks at him for a few moments, then he shifts his gaze back to the ingredients. He doesn't ask further.

The mixture of the blood has a color so dark that it's more black than red. Cas enchants the spell as the black grimoire instructs. The blood still looks the same, dirty and stinking -- the smell of corruption and abomination.

They look at him.

"Cas, you sure about this? Like, really sure? This thing looks like no fun." Bobby frowns deep, all the lines on his weathered face crinkled with concern.

"I'm doing this," Cas says simply, unwavering, unbothered by the smell of the liquid or what it would do to him. His mind can only see the place with the bleachy sky and dying woods, a figure with torn flannel running in it, with only a blade in his hands, facing the whole world of monsters created from the beginning of time, no way out, no rest, not even a damn soul to talk to. "I'm ready." He says. He can't be more ready.

"Alright then," Bobby pushes the jar towards him.

The dark surface of the mixed blood reflects his vessel's face -- the face he's worn for so long Cas already registers as his own. And soon, he may lose the form.

"You may not want to witness the next part," Castiel tells Bobby and Sam, grabbing the syringe he prepared earlier, drawing the liquid up to inject into his own vein.

Bobby widens his eyes once more. "Thought drinking that thing was bad enough."

"Faster this way." Cas draws a full syringe of blood and pumps it in stoically, then the next. Eyes locked on the needle, teeth gritted. His face grimaces with each pump.

Bobby hesitates at the threshold before heading to the other room. "Call me if you need anything."

"I can stay," Sam offers.

Castiel just continues the motion until the jar is emptied.

And then he waits.

The boiling sensation starts from the arm, as the contaminative liquid touches his own blood -- worse than the strongest acid and molten metal pouring onto a human body. And it moves deeper into the system. Like a flash, it reaches the heart and pumps into every part of the body.

Castiel drops the syringe and screams. His body collapses to the floor, eyes wide open but he can't see anything, the world shifts in front of him to a darkened blur.

The sensation is so intense that the Leviathans' attacks in Purgatory are like nothing but tickles. It's not just pain, it's transformation. It's like his blood boiling, melting his bones and flesh, turning his inside out, mashing his gut and brain into mud.

Castiel squirms violently on the floor, yelling in a mixed sound of high pitch and all kinds of human languages, switching from one dead tongue to another, like a computer frantically spitting out random error messages under a virus attack.

His eyes and mouth glow, light starts to flow but instead of leaving the body, the lights flicker, on and off, on and off, until they dim, like a broken light bulb trying its best to lighten up one last time before it blows. The light is captured back inside the body, the same way it can't escape a black hole. Not even any grace can escape the change.

Sam stands by him, watching. Bobby rushes back in at the sound. But none of the men can do anything or have any idea what is happening.

And that is only the beginning.

Castiel's body rises slowly into the air, his eyes half closed, looking half passed out, half dream walking. The lights in the room shake, sounds of thunder rolling from above the ceiling. In the shadow of the flickering lights, there spread the black wings, expanding from his shoulder blades, long and stretched, filling the whole room and beyond. The feathers shine black, the color of the night sky.

"Holy." Bobby gasps, taking a step back in awe. Sam stares.

And then the shape changes -- the dark crimson color of blood crawls from his back, reaching the root of the wings, flowing upwards, staining the feathers. Some feathers fall to the floor, others shrink and twist as if burned by fire. The bones holding the wings crack loudly and bend back, folding inward, twisting into distorted shapes. The wings no longer look like wings, more like bewildering branches with charred leaves barely attached in the winter.

The screaming and yelling of pain die away slowly, the pitch sinking from a human voice yelling to a wounded monster moaning. Low, pained growl.

As the wings fold and twist, they no longer hold the weight of the body, Castiel crashes back down, landing on all fours. Claws and scales grow from fingers and skin, bones shifting, face unrecognizable. A mixed shape of a hundred different wild animals but no name for what Castiel looks like now.

Bobby takes another step back, slowly reaching for his rifle. Sam reaches for his machete.

"Cas?" Bobby calls carefully, forcing his voice to stay as steady as he can manage.

The monster in front of them gnarls, can't tell if it's answering or threatening. He looks up slowly, eyes glassy and foggy. With the slightest shade of blue.

"Cas," Sam takes a breath. "Nod if you are still in there and can hear us."

They watch intensely. And Castiel whines, then, nods once, slowly.

Bobby breathes out heavily. "Good to know. Thank God you're not dead in that whole --" he waves a hand to vaguely refer to whatever happened just now, in place for a word he can never find. He clicks the safety back on.

"Yet." Sam reminds him.

"What?"

"Not dead, *yet*." Sam keeps his hunter's stance, hands still on the machete -- the very same one he carried into that vampire nest where Dean was beheaded. "He still needs to be dead to go to Purgatory, remember?"

Bobby swallows, falls to silence. After a beat: "And you wanna do the honor?"

"Unless you volunteer," Sam says, unbothered. "Don't see a third option here."

The worst thing is, he's right.

"And you're still on board with this 'getting killed to go to the horror land' plan?" Bobby checks with Cas one last time.

The monster that was -- is -- Cas nods unmistakably.

"This is absolutely the shittiest plan I've ever seen, and that includes two apocalypses." Bobby sighs deeply, resigned. He looks at Cas with genuine apology, "I'm sorry." Then to Sam, "Just, don't do it in here, will ya?"

Sam nods once, heading out. Castiel follows.

<br>

Bobby does not follow them outside, and he knows a bottle of whiskey is definitely not gonna be enough for tonight.

He doesn't need to see -- the squeaky sound of footsteps and claws heading to the opening in the junkyard is loud and clear in the midnight silence.

He closes his eyes.

There is the sound of metal cutting through flesh, and then something heavy falls to the ground.

One set of footsteps heads back, stepping on the ground that's now wetter and muddier than before.

Bobby shakes his head hard. "Cas, you stupid love-blind idjit."

<br>

### Chap. 3 Shadow

> 3 Act: Act 2, plot pinch 1 - middle point (moment of truth)

#### Act 1 Ext. Purgatory (Dean, Cas)

> (Dean POV)
>
> Cas falls to Purgatory, finds Dean. Dean doesn't recognize him, monster Cas can't talk, too weak to change back. The two support/survive in Purgatory for a while, Cas eats souls to grow stronger and can heal.

Dean lingers not far from the same opening that he last saw Cas for that brief moment. Sometimes by the stream, sometimes on the edge of the closest woods, but most of the time, just in the plain middle of the opening, without cover. It is a bad idea -- actually, the worst one possible -- to not move swiftly in a place like this.

Purgatory is the monster hunting ground, and staying put means food.

But Dean stays near there anyway. If the monsters come, he kills them. If the door opens again, he goes home. The logic simplifies down to the simplest, Dean distantly wonders if his brain will degenerate for lack of use, but soon he pushes that aside as well.

Leviathans still emerge once in a while, dropping in here and again like a recurring termite problem in an old house, though not as many as when Cas was here. Their faces shift between human appearance and the teethy monstrous face. Decapitation is still the best solution Dean can find. Not like there is any research book or anything else in Purgatory he can use anyway.

He would have lost the concept of time entirely if it's not for his watch still ticking and running. But he doesn't know if it's a good thing or bad. Watching the hands tick one second, then another, slowly crawling forward, Dean thinks going lunatic is just a matter of time if he can't figure something out soon.

And he can't figure anything out.

The air never stirs again in the same way it did when the portal opened last time. There is not lit-up exit, no jail breaker or bail release.

Sometimes, Dean even considers sparing some monsters on his way, keeping one as a pet or something, to at least have something to look at and talk to -- hopefully one that's least ugly to look at -- just to keep himself sane for a little longer. He understands why Robinson Crusoe kept Friday on that island now.

And then, on a day he's long since lost count of which, he is attacked by a dozen vampires at once. Sarcastically, he knows them all. From that nasty nest that started this whole nightmare and sent him here.

He fights and kills and struggles and swings, taking down as many as he can, but a small part of his brain already knows how this will play out. That part of his mind floats above him, watching the scene unfold like a Deja Vu or a rewatched movie.

"I killed you once, don't mind do that again," the big boss vamp grins, showing his ugly fangs, and knocks him down. Dean loses grip on the blade, pinned to the ground, all too similar to the first round.

Where does monsters go after they die in Purgatory? It's not the first time he's wondered, but this time he might actually go check it out himself.

And then, that vamp loses its head. Its headless body freezes, its grip on Dean's throat loosens, and then it falls stiffly down on top of him, not moving an inch anymore. Blood from the broken neck spills all over Dean's face.

Dean looks up.

A large monster holds the bitten-off vampire head between its teeth. The cutting edge where the neck should connect to the body drips blood between the creature's fangs. It sees him, hesitating, as if it can't decide whether to spit that bloody head out or swallow it.

It ends up swallowing it in a gulp. Light flares in its eyes as the head moves down its throat, and moments later, fades again. It still stares at Dean, not even blinking.

Dean jumps to his feet, blade ready, pointing at this new strange thing.

It's a huge creature, casting a long, stretched shadow across the ground as it moves, larger than most of the monsters around here, larger than most of the Leviathans even. Dean has never seen anything like this before, dead or alive, with furs and scales and fangs all at once, a hybrid of so many different things. Large, but broken. Confusing, but powerful. Troubling, but not ugly, not exactly. Just weird, and somehow it doesn't look like it belongs here, or anywhere. A creature that shouldn't exist even in lore. A creature that definitely doesn't look like naturally born.

Dean steps back slowly as the monster moves toward him in small steps, both of them prudent. It must be stronger than him, way stronger. Judging by how it bit off that vampire's head, it could probably kill Dean in a blink without breaking a sweat. Then why is it just looking at him, doing nothing?

Its fangs jut behind its closed mouth, still glinting with fresh blood. On its back, black twisted parts stick out, looking more like broken horns than wings.

Dean frowns at this thing, hunter's instinct kicking in, pulling and dragging him in two different directions. The blade in his hand is still dripping blood from the vampires he killed minutes ago, the instinct of continuing the action he's grown increasingly familiar with washes over him. It might be strong, but Dean is fast. If he's lucky, he might get a chance to its weak spot if it has any -- with such a twisted clumsy body and weird biological structure, he bets it can't move as fast as he can.

But then, there is something else in it that makes him pause. Looking. Observing. Asking questions first and shooting second. Something about this monster -- maybe it's the black wing-like structure on its back, maybe it's the slightly tan hide and dim blue front, or just the way it approaches him, the way it bit off the head of the vamp that almost killed him again -- somehow, Dean think it's not going to hurt him. Somehow, it can be trusted. He thinks he must've already lost his damn mind to think that for a whole new level of freak.

Dean circles it, checking out its side, its back, its shape. It stops moving, standing still, letting him look, allowing him move behind it where it can't see, purring and moaning in a low grave sound. Not menacing, more like a sad, quiet plea. More trusting than anything else he's met in here or out there. He could easily stab it in the back right now if he wanted. Dean silently shifts the angle of his fingers on the blade, gripping it tighter, but not pointing at the thing. Not yet anyway, not unless he has a reason to.

Dean notices it's wounded, badly. Not fatal, probably, but surely hurt like hell. There are teeth-shaped wounds on its legs bleeding black and a round bullet-shaped hole on its shoulder bleeding crimson red. When it moves, its left paw lands shallower than the rest, he'd guess there are cuts there too.

The vampire part of him is still functioning. The metallic smell of blood leaking from the creature is too strong, there is no way of ignoring. Dean sniffs. The most confusing part is, the blood doesn't smell right. Human blood smells fragrant, vampire blood dull and dead, demon blood sour, Leviathans bitter. But this thing, it's like a drug store, with all kinds of bad smells mixed together, flowing in its veins, masking whatever used to be there.

"What are you?" Dean can't help asking.

The monster answers him in a low set of guttural mumbling, presumably telling him things about itself but he hasn't the faintest idea of monster language.

"Alright, chill, pal," Dean says, walking two more steps closer to it, cautiously.

It's about within its attack range now, if it desires. Dean holds eye contact, waiting for a killer blow, weighing whether the blade should target to its paw or the head first if that happens.

But nothing happens. It holds the stare, looking back, looking straight. It barely blinks.

The feeling is strangely familiar.

Dean thinks he even sees a familiar shade of blue. He must be hallucinating now. Or wishful thinking, whatever that means.

"Okay, this is just getting weird," Dean mutters, lowering the blade, shaking his head. "You just remind me of my best friend."

The creature purrs louder, the sound strained and urgent.

Dean raises his eyebrows. Then he tells it, "No, uh-uh, no way, I'm not gonna name you 'Cas' just 'cause you want me to. What do you think my angel buddy would feel if he knew?"

He considers "Thursday" as a name for the briefest moment.

He still ends up naming the creature "Cas".

Cas might just find it hilarious and then have that little amused smile of his, it would be nice to see him smile. Dean reasons with himself, patting the creature gently on the back where the scales cover. It feels cold and sticky.

Dean pulls his hand back.

#### Act 2 Ext. Purgatory (Cas, Dean)

> (monster Cas's POV)
>
> monster Cas pov, can see the world in floating colors, only shapes of colors, no thoughts, no words, light and dark, other monster souls are lights that he can eat, in the center, there is the brightest light, the brightest soul. He approaches, gets too attracted but intimated by the intensity and heat, like wild animal circling camper's bonfire, ghosting at the edge of the shadow, tempted but feared. The more souls he eats, the vision gets clearer, he recognizes Dean. But it only makes him hesitant more, he looks at his claws, making sure Dean doesn't see him. Only go into his view when seeing he's in danger and he has to. self-aware

The world is a pool of shapes and colors, floating and swimming, emerging and diverging. Some shapes and colors move closer, some farther. Some red and its approach burns, some black and tearing and cold, the others vague and grey, passing by without extra sensation.

There is no thought, no words. Light or dark, colored or bleak. That's all there is.

It takes a while to realize the small blinking lights are edible, and those feel good -- making the colors looking brighter and shapes sharper. Almost like the view is getting clearer, but still the same forms.

It takes a longer while to realize those lights are souls, and absorbing them can bring strength back, making wounds heal -- even just slightly.

Castiel wanders in the land, fumbling, searching. Not knowing where he is, not knowing where he's heading. Not knowing what himself is, for the most of the times. Just wandering, drifting. Afloat like a duckweed.

He opens his mouth, growls echoing as the vocal cords vibrates. He sinks teeth, blood seeping out from the things in his bite, bodies twitching, then not moving. The light that rested inside of them shifts and moves along with the blood, moving into him. He swallows them, then moves away.

The creatures and monsters crowd around this place like rabbits in the summer prairie. Led by instincts, he hunts and eats and moves, chasing one sparkling light to another, knowing all of them are nothing more than food and source of strength.

And then he sees it. In the center of the opening, the brightest light shades everything else, dulling up all the other creatures. The light of the soul that is like the beacon on the sea, the North Star of the starry sky, the crackling burning fire in the polar night, the Sun in the dark Space. It's so bright that the lumination and heat almost scorch him from this distance.

But he steps towards it. He can't stop staring it and he can't stop himself from moving towards it. The bright, the light, the heat, the beacon. The center of the universe is there. The brightest soul that he's ever seen.

Even without a clear view, even without a clear mind with any of the memory and knowledge he doesn't know he has, he would know this is what he's looking for -- even if he doesn't remember what it is, or what himself is.

He approaches it, the attraction uncontrollable, but also unavoidably intimating. The intensity and the heat, the light itself, the soul that is so strong, it appeals to him and terrifies him in the same way wild animals getting attracted and frightened by the camper's bonfire in the same time.

Castiel circles around the light, hiding himself in the woods, letting the shadow cover his trace. Tempted, but intimated. Staying in the place where he can see it, but not close enough to be seen.

Time passes by relentlessly, he hunts and eats and devours and waits. The power from the souls of the small creatures and monsters accumulates, the vision gets clearer. So is the mind.

Name is the first thing coming back, language the second.

"Dean." He can see through the shape now, the light of his soul still blinding. The man's name emerges in his beast's mind. Castiel almost makes a long gnarl, but he restrains himself -- Dean might hear him, and then he wouldn't know what to do.

Looking down, he sees his claws on the dusty ground, distained by the dirt and blood. In the reflection of the stream, he sees his own face and he moves back immediately, not wanting to see the hideous figure ever again.

He makes sure Dean wouldn't either.

The woods provide enough of cover, even with his size. He wanders far enough to hunt and grow strength, but not too far to lose Dean's bright lighted soul out of view -- in the end, how can one lose sight of the Sun in the sky?

But then, there are the attackers. The vampires edging and crowding Dean, there are too many of them. The bright light of the soul starts getting overshadowed, the threat of fangs and paws on the body's neck, the danger that is too strong to conquer, and worst of all, the light itself is willingly going out.

Castiel can't have it. For all his existence, this is the thing he cannot allow happen, whatever the cost.

So there is the exposure, and there is the attacking and biting and eating just out of instinct.

The metallic bloody smell assail the nostril, the vampire's head between his teeth then down his throat, it is only then does Castiel realize this is the time when Dean would raise the blade and bury it inside his body.

He freezes, widening his eyes.

His vision clears, the face in front of him sharpens. Dean. It's really Dean. As human as he can be, the face, the body, every inch of the existence so familiar. And his blade high and ready.

"Dean." He calls his name, desperate. The only sound rolling out of his throat is the monster's roar.

Castiel thinks this is the end of it. The end of him, anyway. With all his efforts, at least the very last thing -- very last person -- in his view is Dean. He shouldn't complain too much. He probably deserves it anyway.

He looks into the man's eyes, really looking. Like the mermaid being taken away the voice, the eyes and looks are all he has. He sees the familiar amber green in the man's eyes, the exhaustion, the anger, the confusion. And something else.

He pleads silently. "Please see me, Dean."

The blade is lowered.

Dean is always so full of surprise.

### Chap. 4 Bloody

#### Act 1 Ext./Int. Purgatory (Dean, Cas)

> (Dean POV)
>
> action sequence, kill other monsters together, Cas eats them, grow visibly stronger the more he eats, wounds healing, shape reverting
>
> Dean helps feeding him, making him better

(**Warning words** before the part: mentions of passive suicidal ideation)

<br>

Dean barely sleeps. In a place like this, he can't even blink his eyes too slowly, let alone closing it. He doesn't know how the body functions in this place, whether it really needs sleep or eat or any of the usual human crap his brain was still used to as a living human, but now he's neither living nor human.

But Cas nudges him to rest -- at least he thinks it's what it means.

When his watch points to night time, Cas leads them to a place in between woods. The trunk looks decent as a resting place. Cas stands by it, getting down on its belly, looking at him.

Dean checks the trunk -- nothing special, then looks at Cas, amused. "What? You want to take a nap?"

The monster shakes its head, nudges his side slightly, almost pushing him to the ground.

"Alright, alright, I get it." Dean sits down by the trunk, then curls by its root, resting his head on his arms. "You happy?"

The creature hums a low purring sound, not too different from a cat's satisfying purr after a full meal. Dean chuckles, propping his head up slightly, running right into the pair of eyes that are staring at him.

"Dude, stop watch a guy sleeping like that!" he complains, and that sense of familiarity rises again. He flutters, "But, uh, wake me up if there's anything happening alright?"

He gets another low mumble of confirmation. Dean thinks his monster language is improving.

Dean gets a few hours of closed eyes.

The sky still looks the same when he wakes up. Cas doesn't seem to move an inch. Somehow he does feel better, his body not so intense, his mind getting back online.

Dean sits up slowly, glancing at the creature he named Cas from the corner of his eyes. That thing is doing the same, as if taking that comment of "don't stare" seriously.

"Hey," Dean says. It meets his eyes immediately. Dean can't help feeling the tips of his lips lifting slightly, facsimile of a smile that was never there since he came downstairs.

"Thanks for watching out for me," he tells it. The monster purrs something that definitely means "don't mention it."

<br>

The life improves with Cas hanging around -- though there is never a life to begin with in a place like this. But still, each second passes slightly faster than before, so is each minute. At least that is how Dean feels like.

The best part is, at least he has someone -- something -- to talk with. Not like this Cas would really answer back, but from the way it looks at him, the way lights shift in its starry eyes, he thinks it understands. If it can speak human language, it would just talk.

And sometimes, he thinks he can just understand its purrs and mumbles and low growls from deep under the throat. The unsaid tongues without words.

"Sometimes I would really think about just lying down, you know, I'm so tired. Not exactly giving up, but just not fighting back the faith so hard again. I mean, look at us, what's the point of all this? I'm a vampire and you're... some monster, and we are in Purgatory. If whatever shitty Destiny wants me end up here, fine, I guess, why bother going anywhere else." Once, Dean tells it.

They just finished a fight, it was a pack of werewolves, the leading one was a pure blood, violent and unbelievably strong, even Cas had to struggle with it several rounds before biting into its neck and stopping it for good. Dean was left aside handling a handful on his own. They are both panting and bleeding, exhausted.

Cas growls. Dean drops his look to the ground, wondering aloud in his own head. "I just can't see there is any way of getting out, even if we do, then what? I don't even know how much time passed here, or on Earth, if the time even pass the same. Forty years in Hell is four months on Earth, what if a month here is a hundred years on Earth? Sam could be long gone, and Cas... I don't even know where Cas is or how's his war and everything... Everything might already be too late. God, I don't even get time to tell them anything."

Dean whimpers. The monster he named Cas moves closer, lowering its body, leaning its body onto Dean's side. The twisted charred bones on its back twitches, looking like at an attempt to reach out, to touch him.

Dean shakes his head. "You're not even real Cas, I don't know why I even keep calling you that, I don't even know why I didn't kill you like I killed all the other monsters. I must be losing my mind. Sometimes maybe I was even hoping if I'm ended by some monster here -- maybe could even be you -- then I can stop thinking about all those, things can finally end for good. Talking about peace, eh?"

The creature's eyes meet his, larger and more glaring than ever, bluer and sadder than ever, getting watery on edge even. It makes some sounds from deep below the throat, low and wet, like sobbing.

Dean swallows, touching its side, pressing his head on its scales to let the cool sensation pass through his forehead. He sighs, taking a long breathe. "Sorry." Not sure if it's to make the creature or himself feel better.

He wipes his face with the back of his hands, then does the same for the monster. The tears dropping from its cheek, dipping his fingers wet. "Guess it's not for nothing, at least there's still you -- whatever you are -- still want me kicking around, right, buddy?"

He pats its shoulder twice, gentle, a little higher than the shoulder blade where the wing stretches out -- he's starting to get to know where is safe to touch that wouldn't make a pained sound from the creature.

"Let's keep rolling then, you and me, Thelma and Louise, monster version. Who knows, maybe one day we'll reach the cliff and maybe the jump is the way out."

They keep moving.

<br>

Cas is healing. Dean can't help noticing.

Every time it swallows a monster's head or heart, its eyes would lighten up a little, and after that, some wounds and cuts would heal up -- even just a little bit. After a while, the gash on its leg becomes only a shallow scar, which goes away completely with the death of a pack of djinns.

"Why don't we go hunting some bigger things? Bet they'll do you real nice and comfy." Wiping away the blood on his blade with the sleeve, Dean considers and asks.

Cas narrows its eyes, questioning.

Dean goes, "Eating makes man stronger, I get that. Souls or lives or whatever, you need them, don't you? I mean, I don't have many things on my calendar this time of the year, and we mostly just wait for attacks to get to them. I was thinking, you obviously could get better a lot faster if you eat more, why don't we raid some monster nests and get them for you? Surely dine-in tastes better than delivery?"

Cas hesitates, not looking very fancy of the idea.

Dean studies him, his eyes or whatever way he chooses to express himself lately, the way his head tilts or his paw moves. "You get what I'm saying?"

Cas nods once, but the muscle on his face furrows, closest thing to a human frown.

"Why? You don't like it?"

Cas looks up towards the distance, where some other creatures are howling, and looks back at Dean, eyes flowing with concern.

"You're worried about me." Understanding reaches him, Dean huffs a laugh, twisting his wrist to show off how he could juggle the blade around to kill whatever would stand in their ways.

He pats the monster on the shoulder. "Don't be, I'm a damn good hunter, in case you don't already know. That's my job -- was -- anyway, killing monsters, hunting things, until it ends up ugly like this. 'Sides, I have you on my back, don't I?"

Dean starts moving towards where the howling is the loudest.

Cas follows him closely behind.

<br>

They hit a shapeshifter nest, the nasty things are still the trickiest even after they're in Purgatory, changing shapes into people he knows. The family of the shapeshifters turn into his own family, Sam, Cas, Bobby, Jess, Mom, Dad, even himself, in a clean flannel. A big happy family reunion -- Purgatory version.

"Hate the shifters." Dean murmurs under his breath, chopping the closest one's head off, which happened to be himself.

Cas bites off the shifter-Sam and shifter-Cas's heads.

Soon enough, they take down the rest before the creatures even get a chance to change again or run away.

"We make quite a good team, eh?" Dean looks around, the two of them are the only things left standing in the nest.

Cas wanders deeper into the nest, reaching for the bite before moving back towards the exit.

"Buddy, think you left one behind." Dean reminds it, kicking the shifter-himself's head to Cas. Not sure if this is the very shifter he managed to kill years ago in St. Louis. If it is, then Fate is definitely a bitch that loves joking around and this bastard definitely has an obsession in using his face.

Cas moves towards it, reluctant.

Dean watches it. "What's the matter? Don't have the heart to take a snack because it has my pretty face?" Cas gives him a look. Dean chuckles. "You do know it's not me, right? I'm cool with you eating it -- me -- whatever, so what's your problem? Too shy to eat when I watch?"

Cas makes a voice that sounds awful lot like complain to Dean's ears, and finally absorbs the last shifter head. Dean watches blue white lights filling its eyes and dimming gradually, the wing bone on its back spreading a small angle from its folded twisted position, some scales drop, showing smooth skin underneath, the nails on its paws shrink back one inch or two.

Dean grins. "See? Told ya, feel good, right?"

Cas murmurs something, might be a "Thank you." Even that voice sounds lighter and brighter, less monstrous than minutes ago, less incomprehensive to the extent Dean can guess the meaning from the syllables.

"You're actually kinda adorable, can't believe I just said that. Come on, we might have enough time to find you a second dinner before heading back."

Things are looking good.

<br>

#### Act 2 Ext./Int. Purgatory (Dean, Cas)

> 3 Act: Act 2, middle point (moment of truth, fake ending)
>
> (Dean POV)
>
> Leviathans attack them, Dean knows now the monster accompany him all this time is really Cas. Cas is almost dead under Leviathan's attack, Dean has to hunt and feed him souls to save him and help him recover (kiss him in his monster form).
>
> Cas almost hurts Dean the moment he wakes up, guilty when realizing it's Dean, "way to say thank you", heal him, both recovered/healed

(**Warning words** before the part: Gross description of eating weird things, including monster body parts. Minor dubious consent.)

<br>

Things are never good or easy or anywhere remotely like that in their whole lives. Dean should know.

Cas is getting better, that's for sure. The wounds healing, the monstrous parts molting. The bones on its back stretch from the folded position, finally starts to look like wing bones, though there is still very few feathers left. Paws and furs and scales shrinking and dropping.

Dean has a hunch that this monster isn't a monster to start with, but a hunch is just a hunch, he can't know for sure. Some theories have crossed his mind, sure, but without knowing for certain, without being able to *talk* to the creature, what he knows is still a big pile of jack.

All he can do is scratching his brain out wondering. And continue doing what he and the creature have been doing for god knows how long -- killing, and more killing, the endless killing and hunting. Story of his life.

And then, the Leviathans come back. They were never away, but now they are clearly back into the game, back with their dedicated appetite for them. And they come at the worst time.

Cas is going through another round of changing. It's happening more and more often lately. And the changing process is taking longer and more painful -- judging by its repressed moan and groan. All the scales on the left side of its body peel off, showing naked fresh skin not too different from human skins -- tender, and vulnerable. Dean isn't even sure if it's a good thing or bad. Certainly it's the worst timing when attacks are coming.

Cas is moaning lowly with fear. They're surrounded.

The way those Leviathans approach and circle them, Dean has the vague impression they have the same amount of interest just last time Castiel was here. The only times they show such dedicated focus on one thing.

"Back off!" He yells, tightening his grip on the blade, stepping back until his back is pressed to the familiar body warmth. "It's just called Cas, not even the real Cas!"

The leading Leviathan widens its ugly mouth and laughs, the sound so shrieking that the distant howling of other monsters silenced in terror. "You know nothing." It mocks him, gloating. "We can smell the angel from across the land. Don't know what he did to himself, but now it's back to the delicious dinner flavor."

Dean's heart sinks, he glances at *Cas* in shock, meeting its -- his -- equally heartbroken eyes. Cas isn't exactly back to a form he can recognize him in confidence yet, but somehow, deep down, he thinks he already knew it's true, he just hasn't allowed himself to believe.

He pushes the sick feeling down, for now. The Leviathans are still here.

"It doesn't matter." Dean straightens the face, raising the blade. The body closest to him is still radiating heat in this cold bleak place, the familiar source of comfort.

Dean pulls the tip of his lips, ghosting a smile. "Whatever he is. You are still gonna die. All of you."

The wave of attacks are thrown onto them without warning. The leading Leviathan is fierce and enormous, when it opens the mouth, there are layers upon layers of teeth, all long and sharp like blades, a cave of teeth.

Dean swings his bone blade at it, it doesn't dodge, and the blade does little. Black liquid leaking from the contact, the blade sinking into a body that is definitely not flesh and blood. He gets thrown out of the way, his head knocking onto a rock in the ground, falling unconscious.

The last thing he hears before the black curtain draws in front of his eyes is Cas's pained yell that sounds nothing other than his own name.

Then the blinding lights of grace explosion and the darkness fall on him in the same time.

<br>

His head hurt like son of a bitch.

Dean curses as the sensation draws back into his body, knowing for sure if the pain is still here, he isn't going anywhere else, therefore definitely isn't dead in the monster afterlife, yet.

"Cas." His mind kicks back online, that's the first word popped in. He snaps open his eyes.

He is safe and sound, comfortable even, resting close to a source of warmth and something soft. The creature -- Cas, the real Cas, not just the name -- keeps him close, nestling him under itself -- himself.

Dean has to keep reminding himself the thing is a he, it's Cas, he's Cas.

"God, it's so messed up." He frowns tight, dragging himself on feet, staggering. The back of his head is still throbbing. He tries to ignore it. A painkiller would be his heaven right this moment.

"Hey, buddy." He reaches a hand towards Cas, touching his back, shaking gently. Only to feel a handful of stickiness. Castiel's eyes are shut tight, not moving an inch.

His stomach knits into a knot, sinking to the bottom. "No, no, no. Cas! Cas!" His palm is full of blood, fresh and iron sweet, tempting his own vamp fangs sticking out on instinct.

Dean swallows hard, holding back the breath just in case he can't restrain himself. His throat screams in thirst, he forces it all down.

It is only then does he see the new wounds on Cas's body. The new tender skin that is no longer covered by scales is torn wide open, his internal organs are exposed to the air, mixed with sluggishly flowing light. Grace hesitates on the threshold, moving in and out. The newly spread out wing bone on his back are snapped broken, almost twisted in half, looking worse even than before, hanging pitifully with the body only to the second joint. Corner of his mouth is still dripping blood of his own.

Dean's hands are shaking, panic rising. He reaches for a breath under Cas's nose, testing his pulse on his throat. The tiniest air flow blows onto his skin, the pulse is so weak that he almost misses it. But it's still there. Cas is hanging on the last breath. He hasn't lost him, yet.

Dean breathes out, stepping back, pacing. "Okay, okay, not too late, not bad, hang in there, buddy. What do I do, what do I do."

He glances around them. The Leviathans that were there before are all pieces and tears like exploded balloons now, but the black slime is still moving, one pile wriggling towards another, trying to glue themselves back together.

Dean picks up a dip with the tip of his blade, checking. "This is just disgusting." He looks back at Cas. "What do you think, this thing is edible or not? Would it make you better?"

Cas doesn't stir the slightest for any answer.

Dean has to answer it for himself. "Yeah I agree, can't be too picky right now, am I right?"

He holds a pile of the black goo in his palms, moving back to Cas, touching his lips. "Open up, Cas, dinner's ready."

Cas's mouth is closed tight, not any gap he can slide the "food" in.

Dean stares at him, frowning, desperate. "God, why does everything have to be so difficult."

Heart drumming, looking around, there is nothing around in visible distance, certainly no *one* around would see them.

Dean breathes out, looking at Cas's closed eyes. "Sorry, no other way, don't say I take advantage of you when you're out, alright? Desperate times."

He takes the goo into his own mouth, trying his best blocking out the disgusting slimy texture and bitter taste. Kneeling down so he's in the same height as Cas's mouth where his monster body lays, Dean presses their lips together, pushing the "food" through.

Cas's lips are dry and frustose, rough like tree trunk, taste like copper and iron with a lingering taste of fragrant sweetness from blood. But at least it's opening now under the pressure, the remains of Leviathan slide in.

Dean watches his throat swallow, backing from his position, waiting.

Nothing big happens. No light show. But Cas's breath evens.

"Guess it's doing something then." Dean almost grins, breathing out in relief.

He licks his own lips, not realizing he's swallowing the residual taste of sweetness. When he does, he freezes. The taste is from the blood he touched accidentally on Cas's lips, Cas's blood, the sweet taste of angel blood. No wonder the Leviathans are gathering to him like flies to banquet.

The vampire part of instinct starts fighting for control in his brain, all he can taste and smell now is that specific exotic sweet-smelling. He can hear the blood flowing through Cas's vain now, slowly, as he's heartbeat is so weak -- something he's been trying to block out whenever the two of them are close.

Cas is dying and he's losing it. Dean tightens his fists and knocks it to his own head, desperately trying to clear his own mind.

"Not now!" he warns himself. "I'll kill you before you ever even think about draining him!"

He throws himself further away, taking in the repulsive remnants of Leviathans and leaving them on his tongue, hoping in vain that the disgusting bitter flavor could force back the throbbing hunger and desire. His fangs refuse to shrink back into his gum.

His steps are shaky, hands trembling, but he manages to move back to Cas, kneeling down again like the first time. Forcing the brain to think of only two things in the world that matters: "Cas is dying" and "Cas needs me."

He presses his lips onto Cas's, feeding him the source of strength he undoubtedly needs, then pulling away with a head so dizzy he can't even tell the direction.

But it's working. He can hear heartbeat growing stronger, blood flowing faster in his veins. Which is making the situation increasingly difficult for him, but it's good. It's good. Cas is getting better.

So he does it again.

And again.

<br>

The burning thirst in his throat is like lava boiling. Dean thinks the vampire fever in him might literally burst into flame and burn him alive from the desire. His whole vision is turning red, with the smudge of blood on Cas's lips the cherry on cake.

Dean thinks he could never hate himself more than he does now.

He has to bite on his own wrist to ease the burning in his throat for a moment before continuing.

He manages to continue feeding Cas without totally losing control. He doesn't know how long he can keep doing this, but he can't stop.

Cas's wounds are visibly healing. The bones are growing back.

It takes ages, but they're getting there. The moves are getting familiar, turning into muscle memory.

They finished off the pieces from the blasted Leviathans. Dean changes his strategies. He manages to move further, hunting more creatures and monsters on his own. Be it vampires or werewolves or wendigos or whatever they are, he just gulps them down, feeling the energy from their existence filling his inside, then goes back to the nest he manages to make out of a natural shelter and take Cas to, and feeds him mouth-to-mouth. Life-force energy flows with all body parts and blood is the best medium -- he'll have to write that down in his hunting journal somewhere.

Dean doesn't dare to move too far away or leave Cas alone unconscious for too long, so the trips are cutting short and trivial. It's tiring, but Dean manages it.

The biggest question is, why is Cas still not waking up.

"Used up all your mojo stock for me again, didn't you?" Once, after making sure the flowing light of souls and energies have all gone through into Cas's mouth, Dean steps back, sitting down for some rest for himself, regarding Cas's shape.

"Don't know how much you had to hunt and eat to get to this state, just to throw away and start from ground zero again." Dean frowns at him, wondering aloud. "Cas, why do you keep doing this?"

His best friend just has his eyes closed, quiet as always, not showing a sign that he hears him.

Dean has helped clean him up, wipe his face and body decent without making the wounded parts worse. And with the feeds, he does look a lot better.

Dean checks him up every now and then, noticing the small improvements with every feed. The scales are gone gradually, so are the paws. The wings take the longest time, the feathers seem to have to grow back one at a time, like spring blossoms and buds, but they all look good, shiny black and healthy. Cas's face is back to recognizable too, the same face he's been seeing a little more than two years now plus however many days he's been in here, Dean has no idea how much he misses him.

"Cas."

Sometimes he calls his name. Other times he prays.

The Leviathans had said he is back to angel now, more or less, isn't it? So with some luck, maybe he can hear his prayers better than his words? Dean has to give it a shot.

*Cas, man, please, hear me. Wake up for me.*

Dean thinks hard, more pleading than praying, but he doesn't really care. Anything to make things right again.

Putting words through mind seems to be easier than making them out of the tongue.

*I need you, buddy, you hear me? I need you breathing and kicking and alive, and we'll figure out the rest together. Just, come back to me. Cas, please.*

Castiel's face remains stoic, calm even, as if he's just deep in sleep.

Dean looks at him, having no clue what to do. Cas looks more human than ever -- he can be distant and all powerful when he shows up as an angel, he can be fearsome and terrifying as a monster, but now he just looks like a human plus the wings. Chest rising and falling, everything seems to be normal, just not waking up.

Dean presses the heels of his palms on his eyes, feeling it hot and wet. Hopeless.

Eyes closed, he leans in, kissing the chapped lips, gentle. No soul to feed this time, just the touch.

He doesn't even know why he does that, his own body pulls him forward, leading the motion, and it offers him comfort. And hope. As if saying if he can still do this, then there is still a way out, a way forward. His heartbeat soothes just as his lips caressing Cas's.

That is when he feels the lips shift. There is a startled gasp, an immediate pull away, and a dumb punch in the face.

Dean jumps back, looking up.

Cas is awake, pulled back from where he's lying, back pressed to the wall of the place Dean calls "home base" nowadays. Eyes panicked and shaky. Wings hidden away.

Dean doesn't know what is that feeling in his gut, is that joy or hurt, or both, maybe.

"Cas, Cas, it's me, it's okay." He rushes, holding out a hand like when he needs to calm a startled animal. "You're safe, it's just me."

The blue eyes falls on him, recognition rises. "Dean." He breathes out. The voice hoarse from lack of use, but it's human words. He looks around the place, looks down on himself, checking the fingers and behind his back, then looks Dean up and down. Eyes shining with disbelief.

Dean manages a smile. "Yeah, buddy. It's me. Welcome back."

Cas shifts the posture and sits straight, fingers touching his own lips, slow, as if reliving that lingering aftertaste. Dean feels blush rising up his cheek in the same place where he's punched, he rubs the place, trying in vain to hide it.

"What was that?" Cas looks at him again, gaze following his fingers.

"Nothing." Dean realizes he answered too quick, thinking back. "Just, you know, testing out a theory, and apparently it worked. So now we can just --"

"What theory?"

"You know, just the fairy tales."

Cas raises an eyebrow in question. Dean finds his throat tight.

He sighs. "Sleeping beauty, Princess, everyone knows the story, true love's kiss breaks all curses --" Cas opens his mouth, Dean rushes through, "-- which is probably just some coincidence! Can we just leave it like that?"

Cas closes his mouth, lowering his eyes. "Yes, we can just leave it like that." Then, "I'm sorry."

"For what?"

Cas looks up, guilt written all over his face. "Everything."

"Well, if you mean punching me in the face for waking you up, there're indeed better ways to say thank you." Dean swallows the feeling that is rising in his gut seeing the way Cas's eyes look, but he can't parse any of the meanings.

"Not just that." Cas hesitates, but still, reaching a hand with two fingers pointed out, reaching for his cheek that is slightly getting swollen from the punch. "May I?"

Dean holds his gaze, putting his hands down, nodding once.

The heated sensation on his cheek goes away, so is the other small pain and wounds all over his body he doesn't realize he has. Even his shirts and jeans get cleaned up and smoothed down like coming fresh out of washing and ironing.

Looking back in the angel's briefly brightened up eyes, Dean gives him another small smile. "Thanks Cas, good to have you back."

Castiel swallows, not returning the smile. "There is something I have to tell you."

#### Act 1 Ext./Int. Purgatory (Dean, Cas)

"You what?!" Dean stares at him like the angel transformed into creature again.

"I was working with Crowley looking for Purgatory --" Castiel repeats dutifully.

"Yes, I heard you the first time, dumbass, I'm asking why the hell would you do that!" Dean snaps. "Crowley, really?"

"There was no other way," Castiel answers plainly. The dumbass probably still thinks that remains the best option. Dean really wants to punch him again just to wake him up.

"Dude, there is always a better option than making a deal with the demon! Especially when it's Crowley!" Dean stares him down.

"Like what, for instance?" Castiel meets his eyes.

"Like me! For instance!" Dean can't help raising his voice. "Did it occur to you that you can always come to me for help, Cas? That we don't have to burden everything on our shoulder because we have each other?" His voice drops to a sadness. Dean doesn't want to think about why.

Castiel swallows, and doesn't answer immediately. Dean almost thinks he'd never hear an answer and he wouldn't know what to do with the knot in his gut, when Cas answers, "Yes." Dean doesn't know why he's surprised.

"Yes, Dean, of course I do," Cas tells him, his face covered in remorse, "that was the first thing I did when I realized there was going to be a civil war in Heaven. I was at your doorsteps. But you couldn't see me then."

"Then why didn't you knock?"

"How could I? With everything we've been through," Cas tightens his jaw, "With Hell and two Apocalypses, you finally had a family, a woman who loves you and a kid who admires you, how could I take that away from you?"

Dean swallows hard. "It doesn't matter," he finally manages to say, "that's not the life I belong to anyway."

Cas's eyes sadden. "I can see that. Please know it's never my intention."

Dean has to walk over to the opening of their base to even his breath for a moment. Then, "Well, next time, you have a problem, you go straight to me. No lie, no partial truth. You tell me everything you know, we handle the problem together. You hear me, Cas?"

Castiel watches his back, nodding slowly and solemnly. "Yes, Dean."

Dean glances back at him. "Great, now I feel like some douchbag commander giving orders and you're just like a good little soldier knowing one line for your whole life: 'Yes, sir.'"

Cas blinks blankly. "Are you preferring me to say no?"

Dean sighs with a small chuckle. "It's a joke, never mind. What now?"

Cas walks over to the threshold of the sheltered cave formed by the natural rocks and some extra tree trunks barring as door, looking at the open air and sky of Purgatory at Dean's side. It looks exactly the same no matter how many times they watch.

"Now we leave this place and go back Earth." Cas says.

Dean eyes him, "We can do that?"

"Yes." Cas says briefly, his gaze still on the farthest distance they can reach. The woods are relatively quiet at this hour, but silence doesn't mean safe. There is no safe anywhere in Purgatory, there's only busy hours and slow hours.

"And the punchline is?" Dean knows better than trusting there is any free lunch anywhere ever.

Castiel hesitates.

Dean bites, "What did we just agree on, Cas?"

Cas shifts his feet, "I need to absorb enough souls -- maybe even all of them -- to have enough power to open a portal."

Dean squints, "Which makes it exactly the same plan you had initially to fight with Raphael."

Cas nods.

"Let me guess, the risk is you might not survive this, is that it?" Dean can almost see the card Destiny always love to play on them.

"Possibly," Cas nods again without hesitation, "but we don't know for sure. No one has tried anything like that before."

"So we're like the first ones to try the crabs." Dean tilts his head, "Maybe good delicious food, maybe poisoned to death."

Cas hums quietly in agreement, then, "There is no other way."

"You knew it even before you came down here, didn't you?" Dean realizes, turning directly to face Cas,  "You'll have to do that and you might not survive it."

"Yes." Cas answers easily. "To save you, that's a risk I'm willing to take."

"Why?" Dean asks bluntly.

"Why?" Cas parrots, like he's genuinely confused why that's even a question Dean need to ask.

"Yes, I have to ask, why?" Dean has to push down something bubbling in his own gut again that he doesn't want to touch, just following the conversation that is already out there. His eyes slide down from Cas's eyes to his lips, his mind remembers the taste of his lips, but he forces his eyes move back to the blue eyes. Dean wets his own dried lips unconsciously.

Cas's gaze locks on his eyes, almost piercing deep inside. Then he averts his eyes.

"I still see myself as the Winchesters' guardian angel," Castiel states with an even voice, "I need to take care of the humans in my charge, you and your brother."

"That's it?" Dean prompts, his voice dropping quieter. The bubbles and the knots in the gut are getting worse, he pours some icy water on it and boxes them away.

"Yes." Cas says. Not meeting his eyes.

Dean's Adam's apple bobs up and down once, his eyes lingering on the angel standing straight next to him for one long minute.

"If this is gonna be the last time I see you," Dean says slowly, swallowing hard, "I want you to hear this, Cas: Thank you, I mean really, thank you, for everything you've done for us. For me, especially. I just realized I've never really said that, I can't believe I never did. And I'm sorry for pulling you into all kinds of shitholes, you don't deserve that. And for Christ's sake, you're so much more than just our guardian angel, you're... you're my best friend, you're family. You have to know that, Cas."

Castiel looks at him with a small sincere smile. "Thank you, Dean." He says formally, "It's an honor to know you."

And that, is the breaking point for Dean.

"Fuck," he curses, not caring about anything anymore. Dean reaches out and hauls on Cas's collar, pulling him over, dragging him into a tight hug with his lips on the angel's. The lips are as dry and chapped as the last time he remembered, but warmer and more alive. His teeth almost bump into Cas's lips, with his own fangs digging at the inner of his own lips. Dean restrains himself from using the tongue and teeth. It's still a messy one.

Cas stills for a brief moment. His body moves before his eyes calming down from the wild startle. His arms wrap around Dean's back, pushing a reassuring weight on him, pressing their bodies together with the warmth of the chests radiating through the touch. His lips following Dean's motion, he returns the kiss as Dean leads.

Dean pants when he pulls back an inch, arms still wrapped at the back of Cas's head, his black hair more ruffled than before. Dean rests his head over Cas's shoulder, their cheeks touching.

"That's how much I don't want you die, you get that?" Dean says by Cas's ear, his eyes closed. "If there is any chance of living, any at all, don't die." He hears his tone pleading, and he leaves it be.

"Okay." Cas answers quietly, his voice passing through the vibration of his chest and Dean can feel the vibration right where his heart pounds.

"Okay," Dean pats on his back one last time and lets him go. He wipes the corners of his eyes.

"Alright then. Let's juice you up and blow a hole in this godforsaken place."

<br>

#### Act 2 Ext. Purgatory (Dean, Cas)

Castiel walks out of the shelter, standing in the opening between the trees.

Dean follows him closely, watching the angel's eyes lightening up like every time he ate some monster souls when he was still in that creature form. Dean finds his brain wander away briefly, tempted to ask if Cas remembers everything happened back then but quickly deciding now is not the best time.

There are lights like small stars flying from all directions toward Cas. Whatever he's doing, the food source is coming to him like whales eating in the ocean.

Dean watches the light show with gaped mouth. "If you can do that, why did we even bother hunting them one by one?" he can't help asking but Cas is probably too occupied to answer him right this moment. Dean just watches the light going through his mouth and dissolving into the bright figure he's gradually turning into.

Cas is like an expanding supernova, lightening to as bright as a Sun, and more soul lights are still flying toward his opened mouth.

Dean's amazement quickly turns into panic. "Maybe don't eat all of them, Cas?" He says desperately, hoping Cas can still hear him in the middle of the big light circle. "Or take it slowly?"

The souls fly in a slower speed now after his suggestion. Dropped from the shooting bullet speed at the very beginning, now they are just like birds flying. It seems like Cas does hear him. Dean feels slightly more relieved.

Then Cas drops to his knees suddenly, clutching his chest. The incoming lights stop abruptly.

"Cas!" Dean yells and dashes toward the angel. The light around him gradually recedes, so is the light in his pupils.

The veins on Cas's face and neck are popped up with dark black color, moving under his skin like black worms creeping out.

Dean has seen enough weird things in his life and this still freaks him out.

He puts his hands on Cas's shoulders, holding him straight just in case he collapses or vomits -- which by the look of his pale face and the black patterns in the blood veins, seems to be the very next thing he's about to do.

Cas's eyes are opened but unfocused.

"Talk to me, Cas, buddy, what's wrong?" Dean watches him closely.

Cas's chest heaves and falls violently. His breath is so uneven as if he's trying so hard to keep some pain inside him under control.

Then he finally shifts his eyes onto Dean's face.

"The Leviathans," Cas manages to spit out the word with croaked voice, even deeper than his usual voice.

"What about them?" Dean doesn't follow. He wipes Cas's sweat on his forehead with his fingers -- since when do angels sweat? Cas's skin feels cold -- he's definitely sick if he's a human.

"In me. They're in me and they're alive." Cas's face furrows deeply. He has to close his eyes.

"Oh God," Dean gasps sharply. He remembers the black goo he fed Cas with when they barely survived that siege, and it was definitely still moving. And he remembers the filthy thing can practically glue themselves together no matter how many pieces he cuts them. Which means they are reassembling inside Cas, however that's happening.

"I poisoned you," Dean realizes with horror, "Right when I thought I was helping you recover, I was killing you."

Cas shakes his head with his eyes closed. "Not your fault. We didn't know."

His breathing evens out gradually, Dean still doesn't let his hands go. The black worms in Cas's veins on his face move slower and the color shallows. But Dean doesn't know if it means they are handled by whatever angel immune system can do or they just crawl deeper underneath the surface now.

Cas opens his eyes and tries to stand. Dean holds his arms and helps him.

"Bad poisonous crab," Cas murmurs.

Dean doesn't understand it for a second, then he cracks. He laughs so hard that he doesn't even realize he has tears at the corner of his eyes again.

Cas glances at him with pure joyful glint in his eyes.

"That gotta be the worst joke in the history," Dean comments.

"It's the best if it made you laugh," Cas answers with a small smile of his own.

Dean tilts his head slightly, close to a nod, "Can't argue with that."

Then Cas says quietly, "It's nice to see you laugh like that again."

Dean's smile drops. They both hear the unsaid part: "if it's the last thing I'd ever see again."

Dean swallows again, then asks, "How do you feel?"

"I need to continue," Cas answers simply, "I haven't taken enough power yet."

Dean guesses as much, but hearing it still makes his stomach drop, "Any way to filter out the bad food?"

"I can try, but it might be difficult." Cas says.

"Try then." Dean begs.

Cas meets his eyes, giving him a small nod, and the process starts again.

Dean has to retreat to a few steps away when the light show restarts. Looking at them long and close enough, he thinks he can tell the difference between some of them. The soul lights have different sizes and colors, most of them are like sparkling fire worms, with a tad of color, white and red are the most common ones. He wouldn't be surprised if the red means vampire, which also means must be what his own soul looks like right about now. There are also black spots among the other soul lights, must be Leviathans if he has to guess.

Thankfully, there aren't that much black spots judging by what he can see, a small relief but it's still not good enough. Dean stands there watching all the light dots flying into Cas's mouth, feeling useless.

Knowing those poisonous monsters will be hurting Cas from inside but he can't do anything, it's almost as bad as watching his mom and his house burning again. The flame of that's night's fire is still burning hot and red at the back of his retina. The bloody shades that would never disappear. And right now, with Cas standing in the middle of the woods, it overlays with the angel.

Dean tastes blood just as he watches and thinks. He doesn't realize he was biting his lips until the metal taste spreading on his tongue. His throat is already moving automatically to swallow his own blood.

He's a vampire, his guardian angel is turning into a soul bomb with poisonous prebiblical things lurking inside him, and his brother is another puzzle mess they still haven't figured out what's wrong. Welcome to Winchester freak show.

<br>

The last wave of lights pours into Cas and then there is no more.

Dean is already running toward Cas. Mixture of blood and black goo drop from the corner of Cas's mouth. Dean's gut twists violently seeing him like this. Black patterns crawl from beneath Cas's collars, covering half his neck and face like a cobweb shaped tattoo, except the shape is alive. The black lines and curves swim across his skin, moving from one side of the cheek through the forehead to the other side. Dean is sure if it's a horror movie, these black worms sure as hell will bite open the skin and crawl out. Just the thought of that gives him goosebumps.

He has to force his eyes on Cas's, forcing himself on the thought that this is still Cas, whatever form he turns into, just like when he was in the creature form.

"Cas, talk to me, say something," Dean begs.

"You need to go now." Castiel says stiffly without looking at Dean. The voice doesn't sound like him, the squeaks and whispers hidden underneath as if he has to speak over a whispering crowd. His hands are clutched to fists, holding near his body straight and rigid like he's putting enough force to keep them there.

Dean reaches out trying to hold Cas's arm, but Castiel pulls it out. He points his palm up straight toward the opening. Light and sound of explosion bursts out. A swirly circle the size of a grown man with blue white cloud on the edge shows up right before their eyes. Dean doesn't have enough time to cover his ears and now they're buzzing badly. He curses loudly.

He sees Cas lands his eyes on him once again, his mouth opens, but Dean can't hear anything. He gestures to his temporarily deafened ears pitifully.

Cas puts a hand on his shoulder and he can hear again. Better than that, the sound is normal like what he's used to as a human, without the pumping voice of blood running through veins. He touches his gum, and there are no more fangs.

But he doesn't have time to say thank you for fixing him.

"You have to go now," Cas pushes him.

Dean doesn't want to move, "Come with me."

A black line moves from Cas's cheek to his eyes, dying his right eye black. Staring at Dean with two eyes of different colors, Cas demands, "Go, Dean, don't make me hurt you."

### Chap. 6 Crimson

> 3 Act: Act 2, plot point 2

#### Act 1 Ext. Purgatory portal (Dean, Cas)

> (Dean POV)
>
> Cas blows up a hole in purgatory to push Dean out (heal him too, transform back to human again), tries to stay behind to keep everything in purgatory not escape by using his body as patch to the hole (and guilty for making the mistake to fail Dean, self-punish)(keep the bad things in the cage)
>
> Dean insists him out too or else he'll jump back in & they'll help fix Cas's leviathan problem, Cas complies finally, drooping leviathan ooze occasionally but mostly can hold them back.

Some of these days, Dean Winchester thinks their life is like a horror movie; other times, he thinks even horror movies would be better and easier to live through than their real life, because he usually can see what's coming. There would be a pattern, a rule, a consensus between the monsters and victims and the audience. But here, right before him, there is no such rule. Which means creepy shit just keeps happening and keeps getting worse and weirder with every move he took. Like right about now.

"Cas, fight it, I know you're in there." Dean takes a small step back, just to keep a safe distance with the creature that's taking Cas's form, while a moment ago, it's Cas taking the creature's form. He's going to lose his minds just trying to think this straight.

"I know, because I AM right here." The black line moves away from Cas's eye, becoming a curve across his forehead, lining from his scalp to the center of his nose bridge. Cas continues talking, voice eager and terrified, "Dean, please."

Immediately, the tip of his mouth drags up in a curve that Cas's smile never would, and he says, "Where else would I be?"

Dean thinks he's definitely about to lose his mind and have nightmares.

Cas reaches for his arm, pulling him closer as if wanting to hug him one last time, but at the last moment, pushing him toward the portal. His face twitches from the pulling and pushing, black goo continuously dripping from the corner of his mouth.

The gesture is clear enough even if he might not have the control of his voice or eyes at the same moment.

Dean stares at his eyes, desperately looking for the familiar way it always look back at him, "Cas, I know you can hear me. We can fix this, when we're out there. Bobby will have some book, and we can fix you. Just, come home with me."

Dean grabs Cas's wrist, doesn't let him go. He is right on the edge of the portal now after Cas's push. The swirling cloud circles around his feet, one more step and he's home sweet home.

Cas meets his eyes, same desperate emotions spinning in those eyes. "It's a fight I'll lose sooner or later, Dean," his voice is his own now, "you have to understand. Purgatory is where all the monsters are, that's where I should be."

"Where the hell did you get that idea from?" Dean growls, trying desperately to drag Cas toward the portal.

Cas's hand is pulled away easily, then pushing Dean harshly. Dean trips to the ground. "You know, he's not wrong." The Leviathan inside Cas takes over and smirks. "He IS a monster now. Actually, he's many monsters at the moment. Plural."

"Who am I talking to, you dick?" Dean glares through Cas's eyes, looking inside at the dark creature.

"We don't have names." The Leviathan tilts Cas's head, as if giving Dean a good look, "But you may call me Dick."

"Yeah, suits you really well." Dean bites.

"Now if you'll excuse me, I have a ride to catch, and a world to conquer." Dick takes a large step toward the portal. Dean doesn't know if he wants to help him or stop him now.

Cas's own legs twist into a knot, left foot fighting the right, and he tumbles to the ground. Two steps away from the portal now.

Dean runs his hand over his face. He hates it when he seems to be on the same side as the monster. Cas might be right, they might unleash the worst monsters into the world if they let it out, but no way in hell is he going to leave Cas alone in Purgatory. Not after what they've been through down here. And if he remembers it right, the rest of the Dicks are still waiting to eat Cas alive.

"Cas! Come on!" Dean yells.

"I'll close the portal once you are out!" Cas shouts back at him, crawling on the ground using only his hands to pull his body away from the portal. "Go now, Dean!"

"No." Dean makes up his mind. "If you stay, I stay."

"For God's sake, this is like the worst commercial, can you talk to the idiot angel? Like, really talk?" Dick pops in, looking at Dean through Cas's eyes, "You really don't know why he wants to stay behind?"

Dean glares back at the creature, pissed, "You do?"

"I'm literally in his head. Don't ever say I never did anything for you, *Dean*." Dick mocks his name, then, "That's the way the angel says sorry. Oh and, he doesn't think he's important to you enough that worth your time to save him, all he wants is you happy and safe. There, go figure that out."

Dean is choked for a brief second. He wants to call the hideous creature a liar, but for once, he knows better. He says instead, "I'm not doing this for you."

"Whatever you say," Dick grins.

Cas's face shifts from smirk to a controlled concentration in a blink.

"Cas, you there?" Taking a deep breath, Dean asks.

"Yes, it's me." Cas pants in grave voice. His knuckles are white from grasping the rocks and stones on the ground, trying to crawl farther away from the portal.

Dean kneels down before him, and he has to take a second deep breath. Then he meets Cas's deep blue eyes. He manages to ignore the black worms that are still visibly crawling underneath Cas's skin through his veins.

He gives him one of his best smiles. "I thought I was clear enough earlier." Dean tries, eyes on the angel's lips, hoping silently the hinting is good enough.

Cas narrows his eyes slightly in question.

"That you are important to me." Dean has to finish his sentence.

"That I'm not dead." Cas extends the sentence.

"No, not just that." Dean sighs. Why is this so difficult? He squeezes words out, slowly, like he's learning vocabularies from his own words, "You're important to me, because you are Cas. Whatever you do."

"Okay." Cas answers reluctantly. It is just so clear the words fail to sink in.

Dean closes his eyes and says desperately, "I will never be happy, if you don't come with me and be safe and happy out there. Is this clear enough?"

Cas blinks. "Oh."

Dean opens his eyes. "Yes."

Cas says again. "Oh."

And Dean confirms again. "Yes."

Cas slowly stands to his feet. His two feet are not fighting anymore.

Dean grips his wrist.

"Come on, let's go home."

<br>

#### Act 2 Int. Bobby's place (Dean, Cas, Sam, Bobby)

> they both back on earth, Dean finds out Sam has issue, ask Cas to check, realize Sam's soulless (Cas doesn't know that until now)
>
> Cas drooping leviathan ooze occasionally but mostly can hold them back.

"Sam, Sam! Gun down! It's us! For God's sake!" Dean ducks just in time for the bullet to fly over his head, whooshing out of the opened window. Cas, however, gets one right on his chest.

"Jesus Christ, we should have 'no gun in room' policy!" Dean rushes to check on Cas, who already removed the bullet and is examining it carefully on his palm. The trench coat has a new bloody bullet hole, but other than that, he looks okay. Dean lets out a breath.

"What's that about? Red alert on enemy angel incoming?" Dean glares at Sam.

Sam shrugs, "Sorry, muscle memory. Maybe use the door next time."

Dean stares at him unbelievably, "Oh that's how you say 'welcome back'? 'Maybe use the door next time'? That's -- that's just great."

Dean turns around to look for Bobby.

Bobby meets his eyes, giving him a nod and a tight smile, "Welcome back, Dean." Throwing a glance in Cas's direction, he adds, "Looks like your angel found you, like he promised."

Dean nods, glancing back at Cas as well. The black goo dripping from Cas's fingertips slowly forms a small black puddle on the floor.

"He ain't looking so hot though. Any new problem we need to handle?" Bobby asks with an unsurprised annoyed look.

Dean doesn't even bother to look surprised or offended at that. "Yeah, about that..."

Sam doesn't shift his gaze or aim at Cas since the two of them fly in.

"What are you?" Sam demands coldly.

Cas answers him, "I'm still me. Castiel, Angel of the Lord."

"Then what's this?" Sam scoffs, using the muzzle of his pistol to gesture the black ooze on the floor and Cas's face, referring to the suspicious black worms lurking inside him.

"How did you two come out of Purgatory?" Bobby adds questions to the pile, "Are you still a vamp, Dean?"

"No fangs now, thanks to Cas." Dean starts with the easy question, hurrying toward Cas and pointing a finger at Sam's gun, "Take that away, will ya? No one points gun at anyone in this house. Not on my watch."

"That should be my line." Bobby mumbles.

"Only if you explains what's wrong with him." Sam doesn't give in. "Not my fault he looks like want to eat me or kill me. I'm only self-defense."

Dean tries to pull Cas away but the angel doesn't move.

"Cas absorbed the souls in Purgatory to juice up and blew up a hole to save both of us, with a little side effect we need to figure out how to fix." Dean is genuinely pleased he actually managed to summarize everything downstairs in one sentence.

"Which is?" Bobby prompts, eyes shifting between Cas and Dean.

"There's this monster in Purgatory -- the Leviathans." Dean considers how to best put it, "Well apparently, according to angels, these things are so vicious and can't be killed, God specifically created a jail to lock them away."

"Let me guess, now they are in Cas and ready to have some fun outside the jail." Bobby says gloomily.

"Something like that." Dean considers, "You know what, exactly like that."

"And how are you gonna kill some monsters not even God knew how to kill?" Bobby squints at him.

Dean says, simply, "We'll figure out something. Now your turn," he turns to Sam, "what's your problem?"

Sam shrugs, "Nothing?"

"You haven't been right since Stull Cemetery." Dean frowns, then turns to Bobby, "Tell me he looks sketchy to you too."

Bobby levels the look, "I didn't live with him or go hunting with him everyday."

"You don't need to live with him to know. Just look at him!" Dean can't help himself, raising his voice.

"Don't you start lecturing me in my house, boy." Bobby grumbles. "But yes, he volunteered to kill Cas, do the math."

"What the hell?" Dean looks at Sam unbelievably.

"And maybe some other men he didn't want us know." Bobby adds.

Sam defends, "That's Cas's idea, he killed a lot more than I did when you were gone, Dean. I told him to let you go but he didn't listen."

"I was just trying to save Dean." Cas defends too.

"What's wrong with all of you?" Dean stares at them one at a time, "Am I the only moral compass in the room now?"

Sam shrugs once. Cas tilts his head toward him.

Bobby answers, "Guess that's why they need you."

Dean sighs. "Alright then, one problem at a time. Let's figure out what's wrong with Sam. Cas, little help?"

"I'm not a human doctor." Cas states perplexedly.

"We don't exactly have a post-Hell syndrome human doctor, do we?" Dean is trying his best to manage his temper but it's near the limit, "Can't you use your new mojo or something to figure it out?"

Cas approaches Sam on the sofa, who still refuses to let go of his pistol. Dean grabs it away from him. "You know it's not gonna do anything to him anyway."

"Not if I have angel-killing bullet," Sam meets both Dean and Cas's eyes, Dean's glaring with burning flame, "Just saying."

Cas reaches a hand for Sam's forehead, a gesture to test his body temperature. Sam leans back, away from him. "Not that I'm prejudiced or anything," Sam points at Cas's Leviathan problem, "You sure it's not contagious or anything?"

Cas turns to look at Dean for help.

"How the hell would I know?" Dean says grumpily. Honestly, it didn't even cross his mind when he was hauling and pulling Cas out of Purgatory. But just to be on the safe side, "Fine, no touching then. Cas, can you do that?"

Cas hums quietly, holding his diagnostic hand six inches away from Sam. Sam just stares at him.

"His soul is missing." Cas concludes bluntly after a few minutes.

Dean looks back and forth between them. "His soul?! How's that even possible? Where is it then?"

"My guess is... Still with Michael and Lucifer, in the Cage." Cas answers, his feet shifting on the floor.

"Whoever brought me back did a really shitty job, it looks like." Sam comments.

Cas looks down uneasily, opening his mouth but no words coming out.

Dean studies him, "Did you... It's not you, is it, Cas? Brought Sam back without his soul."

Cas swallows. "I didn't realize it at the time. I'm sorry." He doesn't meet their eyes. "It's not easy to save someone from a Cage with both Michael and Lucifer in it, you must understand. They were not exactly in a good mood."

Sam scoffs. "'Not easy.' Sure. You got Dean back pretty decently, with everything put back together, wrapped in a gift box with a cherry on top."

"Sam! Not helping." Dean snaps.

"I said I'm sorry, I truly am." Cas says, "And I intend to fix it."

"Sorry doesn't do shit." Sam mocks, "You have plan to go downstairs to Hell any time soon?"

"Sam! We just came back!" Dean feels like he's trapped in the middle of a crossfire. Middle-east is probably an even easier place to go at this time of the year. "We'll make a plan, and then we go and fetch it, right, Cas?"

"I fully intend to go to the Cage again," Cas promises solemnly, directly to Sam now, "I only wish for your forgiveness for this is one of my many mistakes."

"Cas, don't!" Dean doesn't know if anyone is even still listening to him, feeling nothing more than a clown spinning in the middle of a ball room.

"Guys." Bobby's voice cuts in.

Sam and Cas are still heated in quarrelling. Dean wants to hit his head on the wall if it can pull the two of them apart.

"Guys!" Bobby calls again with higher volume. "We got a visitor."

Dean looks up, recognizing the guy in V-collar shirt and casual suit. Only one man in the whole world dresses like that -- one angel, to be accurate.

<br>

### Chap. 7 Grey

> 3 Act: Act 3, twist, climax, wrap up
>
> (add setting: the more Cas use god power, the more leviathan-corrupted he is, so they can't keep asking him doing things; Dean keep worry about Cas's condition, Cas still morally grey but only light grey)

#### Act 1 Int. Bobby's house - Day (Dean, Cas, Sam, Bobby, Balthazar)

> They need to fight off Raphael & go to Cage to face Michael/Lucifer to save Sam's soul, so combine the two tasks together. Cas wants to go do all these alone, Dean doesn't let him
>
> argument, even fight a little (Cas still a bit grey, beat Dean to protect him, then heal him), eventually agree do everything together, live or die

"Balthazar." Castiel walks toward him slowly.

Dean and Bobby trade a look. Never a good news when angels make house calls. They learned it the hard way.

"A bit busy here," Dean says, not in his friendliest manner, "What you want?"

"Knew I could find you here, Cas." Balthazar straightforwardly ignores Dean, speaking directly to Cas. "Haven't seen you for a while."

Cas squints slightly. "We have met recently."

"Yes, yes, but not after you get a full system upgrade." Balthazar stops moving when he's in front of Castiel at least two steps away. "You forgot to share your summer plan with the rest of the class, Cas. We are worried."

Dean eyes them skeptically. "Didn't see you helping if you're really that worried." He chimes in.

Balthazar gestures at him casually, still talking with Cas, "I see you're still hanging out with the hairless apes. To be honest, I'm surprised your new charged batteries haven't burned their eyes out yet."

That gets Dean's attention. "What are you talking about?"

Balthazar finally meets him in the eyes, "Oh, am I the only one in the room noticing our Cas here is buzzing with energy? Upstairs already got a power meter overload, red alerts everywhere. The last time it happened, let me see, ah, never. Not once since God left the building. You are about all God-level power now, Cas. Let me guess, you already found Purgatory and took everything? That's practically blowing the battle horn. Want to take a bet how soon Uncle Raphael will find out and come pay a visit?"

"God power, you say?" Dean tenses, turning to Cas, "How many souls did you take exactly, Cas?"

Sam cuts in with triumph, "That's what I've been trying to say but you wouldn't listen, Dean." He picks up his pistol again, gesturing toward Cas, "The angel-killing bullet didn't do anything on him because he's not an angel anymore!"

"You could have killed him!" Too much information dropped, Dean feels his head throbbing with fury and headache. He doesn't even want to know where Sam gets angel-killing bullets from.

He wants to find a paper and writes down all the things that need saving, and then crumples the paper and throws it out of the window.

Cas is already making decisions for his moves, "I'll take the fight to Raphael before he comes here," he says to Balthazar, but his eyes flash Dean a quick glance, "then I need to go to the Cage to meet Michael and Lucifer again."

"Aren't you the busiest guy today, meeting three archangels in a day, is that a family dinner thing for your first day as God?" Balthazar jokes.

Cas doesn't answer.

The two of them starts heading outside.

"Cas, no, don't, bad plan." Dean doesn't know what else to do except for stopping Cas on his way out. But they probably don't even need a door to get out. "Please, let's think about it. What about your little... Leviathan problem?"

"What about it?" Cas looks down at his hands, the black goo is not dripping as much as it did when they first came back, but sure enough, he's still not fully well and himself.

"What are you gonna do if Dick takes over again when you're fighting Raphael or Lucifer?" Dean reasons.

"Then I die." Cas answers easily, "Or I don't die, and Leviathans kill the archangels, because rock beats scissors, Leviathan beats angel."

"Which always leaves the biggest shark in the tank, exactly." Dean suggests, "Why don't we take it strategically, then? Throw all of them in the same tank, let them fight. We watch on the bench with popcorns, how about that?"

"What happens to the winner?" Cas tilts his head.

"Nothing. Whoever wins wins, but they are still in the tank -- in our case, it's the Cage." Dean says cheerfully, "If the Cage really is as good as everyone says it is, then we can just leave them there forever, all problems solved. No one dies and we come home happily ever after."

Cas thinks about it, "It might actually work."

A dark black vein crawls across Cas's cheek as he speaks, it moves over his eye briefly. Cas blinks far too many times. Then with a over compensated smile, he says, "Thank you, Dean. That's a really good advice. I'll definitely take it."

Castiel's body turns to the door ready to head out again.

"Hey, Dick," Dean calls behind him again, "You do know it includes you too, right? In fact, I will personally make sure you're torn to pieces by the other big players because you're the worst."

"And how are you planning to do that?" Castiel's eyes glance at him with cold black color.

"Start with helping Cas get back the control." Dean takes a breath, holding his hands in fists. "You know what's the biggest advantage that Cas has but you don't?"

"Angel's big blue puppy eyes?" Dick smirks.

Dean looks at him straight, "Me."

"Then I'd just kill you first." Dick grabs Dean at the collar and throws him out to the junkyard.

His back hits a tree trunk with a thud, Dean climbs to his feet slowly with a suppressed pained smile, "I was hoping you'd say that."

Dick in Castiel's body walks toward him in a beeline, but stumbles slightly on the steps. "I don't see how getting yourself killed can help your little angel friend in here."

Dick chokes Dean's throat in one hand, and starts using the other fist to punch his face.

Dean's pretty sure his nose is broken at the third or fourth punch. His face feels sticky, but he doesn't even bother blocking the attacks. He drops to his knees in the beat-up.

"Because you missed the private session." Dean keeps the smile on his likely totally messed-up face.

*Come on, Cas, take back control.*

"I see everything the angel sees," Dick beats him on the head with Castiel's hand, "I hear everything he hears. We are one." The fist is as heavy as iron, Dean sees stars in front of his eyes. He prays harder.

*Cas, come on, need more motivation than this? I'm keeping him busy here, but not sure how much longer.*

The next fist that's aiming for his eye socket avert the direction midway, ends up landing softly near his ear.

Dean can barely keep his eyes open around the swollen flesh. His breath is choked short.

*Cas, come back to me. I need you here. I know you're stronger than these bastards. Come back to me if you love me.*

The grip on his throat loosens. Dean looks up, running right into the unmistaken blue eyes of Cas's.

The next hand reaching toward him touches his forehead with two fingers. Dean can practically hear all the bones and flesh in his body and on his face shift back to where they should.

"Welcome back," Dean tells Cas.

"How long have you known it's not me?" Cas pulls him up from the kneeling position.

"Since you are too eager to jump the tank with the big guns alone without even asking, because we had an agreement, didn't we?" Dean leads them both back into the house.

"And how do you know this could work?" Cas looks at him with a disapproved look, "I could have killed you."

"One, this isn't you." Dean counts with his fingers, pointing the "one" at Cas to get more of his attention, "And two, I know now you'd do anything to stop any harm in my way, so I figure that should be enough motivation to get back behind the wheel."

Cas ducks his head. "Dean, now that I'm myself again, may I propose that we go to Heaven then Hell together?"

Dean answers with a smile, "Don't use the word 'propose' in a sentence like that again unless you mean honeymoon. And yes, let's kick some fat asses."

#### Act 1 Ext. Heaven - Day (Cas, Dean, Raphael)

> Cas&Dean go to Raphael and fight with his god+leviathan part, Raphael is no match, Cas drag him to Cage to force him to watch

This isn't Dean's first time visiting Heaven, but this is definitely the first time visiting Heaven at war time.

He's not sure what he's expecting, but certainly not troops lining face to face on an open field, all armored with helmets and swords, the ancient Greek style.

"Thought you guys should be more fancy and modern now." Dean murmurs under his breath to Cas, as they approach the center of the field.

"This is the biggest field we get," Cas answers quietly, "we're in Achilles's chamber, so we adapt. Not many warriors want to spend the eternity on the battlefields, so not many open lands like this."

"Fair," Dean can relate.

The field is wild, one side to the sea, the other against a high city wall. Their itinerary doesn't include going to Troy today though.

Dean notices the troops that gather near the city wall are tens of hundreds times smaller than the other side.

"That's yours?" Dean nods at that side.

Cas nods back. "I did my best, and that's all the angels believing in free will and humans. I'm disappointed at my siblings." He explains.

"Don't be too hard on them," Dean studies them from afar, can't quite make out their figures as all look exactly the same, "I'd say that's already a good amount turning around from being total douchbags in a day."

"I expected more from my brothers and sisters," Cas states, then, "but it doesn't matter today. Today it's only with Raphael."

"One-on-one dueling style?" Dean eyes him from the side.

"I believe so," Cas checks around.

"Does that make me your stable boy or squire or something?" Dean suddenly frowns lightly. "You have one of those fancy fighting dresses I can assist you wear?"

Castiel is almost flustered, turning to face Dean directly, "No, Dean, you're not my servant. I will never ask you to do such thing."

"Easy, Prince, just a joke." Dean chuckles.

<br>

They arrive at the center of the field with maybe a hundred thousand eyes on them. Dean recognizes Balthazar standing in the front of Cas's army. The other side, Raphael shows up in a female vessel.

The two of them step into the very center line between the two troops. Raphael meets them there with a stoic look. Two of their angels stand guarded ten steps behind her. Dean doesn't really know if anything happened to Raphael, what's the use of them -- surely something can't handled by an archangel is above average paygrade angels.

"Are you here to surrender, Castiel?" Raphael speaks haughtily.

"No, Raphael, I'm here to hear yours." Castiel answers with equal pride.

"What makes you think you can survive another crush from my wrath?" Raphael raises a hand, thunderbolts showing between her fingers.

So much for negotiating.

"Everything." Castiel answers, as his eyes brighten up.

The clouds roll and toss over the fake-sky, the sunshine and bright day turns into a dark gloomy afternoon before a fierce storm coming in. Flashes fly across the sky, thunders drumming over the horizon. The whole ground shaking.

Dean has a feeling the trembling ground is not just in this Achilles's Heaven chamber, but vibrates through every inch in Heaven.

"You found the most unholy place and contaminated yourself with it." Raphael condemns, her voice thin against the wind and thunder. She has a long golden angel blade held out in her right hand. The blade has spiral edges like a goat horn from one of those medieval biblical paintings.

Castiel is unmoved by the menace of the blade. He holds out a hand and grabs Raphael on the throat, holding her off the ground, hanging in the air as easy as squeezing a fly.

Raphael manages to scratch his arm with the archangel blade, but Cas shows no sign of noticing any of the tiny scratches. Raphael's eyes widen with uncertainty.

The war is finished before it even begins.

"I could kill you with a snap," Cas informs the archangel with his low grave voice, black goo drops from his fingertips onto Raphael's throat, sinking under the armor his vessel is wearing.

Raphael still has the remnant of burning fury in her eyes, but the flame is turning into charred ash by each minute. The archangel does not have any chance overturning the table, so she is wise enough to not even bother trying.

"What do you want to do then?" Raphael challenges.

Dean glances at Cas, who apparently has the answer ready long before coming to the place.

"You might enjoy a reunion with your brothers." Cas renders the verdict, "Come with us to Hell."

<br>

#### Act 2 Int. Hell, Cage (Cas, Dean, Raphael, Michael, Lucifer)

> Cas drag Raphael to Cage to force him to watch
>
> Cas go into Cage in god+leviathan form, fight off Lucifer+Michael (all 4 archangels together can win God-level power, but still can't win Leviathan, "rock beats scissor, leviathan beats angel"). Cas force grab Sam and Adam's soul back, fix them (heal/wipe broken memories, give Adam a new body), lock Michael/Lucifer back into Cage for Earth's sake (Adam's soul+body asleep, Sam's soul in a briefcase)
>
> Cas threaten ask Raphael if he will obey him now, Raphael fake comply, curse him fake God actual monster and most deserve the Cage, willing for mutual destruction and push Cas together fall into Cage

The Hell ride is much smoother than Dean expects. Not a single demon on sight, not even Crowley. The stairs downward are an empty endless spiral stairs. It's only one step away from having a red carpet home-coming party, another step in the other direction to be just a deserted construction building.

They fly down to the lowest level.

The Cage hangs in the absolutely dark space with all but nothingness. Not even a single lighting source.

Cas magics a torch out and hands to Dean.

The Cage is chained with eight long thick iron chains locked on the eight corners of its cubical shape. Countless smaller strings extend from the Cage's edges and sides. The box does not swing the slightest in the mid-air.

Dean has to admit, this place looks a thousand times worse than the Pit. And he isn't even inside it yet.

"Sam's in there?" Dean whispers with a bump in his throat.

Cas nods quickly, fingers nimbly dancing on the thinnest strings in the space that Dean doesn't even notice exist. Cas touches and tunes them one by one like unlocking the most complicated lock in the history. Dean's eyes follow his fingers' movement closely.

It indeed looks quite impossible to go in or out of the Cage, by the look of its security system. Dean feels so much more confident in locking away some bad guys in there.

The last string loosens with a tiny clanking sound. The top cover of the Cage opens up automatically.

"Watch," Cas orders Raphael. With a snap of his fingers, the side of the Cage turns transparent.

Two archangels and two slightly glowing lights in the vague shape of human figures crowd in there like caged animals at zoos.

Cas turns to Dean, "I would have asked you to wait here too, Dean."

Dean glances at the glass cage. "But Sam's there."

"That's why I said 'would have', you wouldn't agree anyway." Cas nods with understanding.

He flies the two of them into the Cage.

<br>

Sam's soul crawls into a tiny small ball on itself at the farthest corner to Lucifer. Adam and Michael take another corner. Lucifer has more than half the space to himself, and he is singing the worse off-key pop tune at the top of his volume. Sam's soul trembles whenever Lucifer looks his way.

"Dean Winchester and Castiel," Lucifer stops pacing around the Cage, turning to them. "Aren't I lucky to have two visitors today. Sammy, Mikey, wakey wakey, we got visitors."

Of all the angels and demons, Lucifer has still managed to be the worst in every sense.

Dean wonders why Michael and Lucifer still haven't choked each other to death after one year in there.

"Because we're the besties, aren't we, Mikey?" Lucifer reads his mind -- or maybe just randomly guessed right his thoughts.

Michael pays him no attention.

Dean rushes toward Sam's soul.

The poor thing is tortured to shivering at even the smallest move or sound in the air. Its light dimmed and flickering as he approaches. Dean holds out a hand toward the center of this cloud of light, the soul screams in pain and terror. Dean stares at this thing that's supposed to host Sam's memory and past, the part that makes Sam Sam, but looking at it now, he fears he's not making the right decision.

Castiel is a bit too busy to help with Dean's dilemma, he is reaching to take Adam when Michael starts moving, the first sign that shows he's still alive. Michael attacks without any foretold, like a cat suddenly throws themselves to a nest of birds. His angel blade appears in his palm in no time and stabs at Cas, Adam falls back into Michael's arms.

Cas shifts to the side to dodge the blade. Michael may be fast, but God power is faster.

On the other side, Lucifer coordinates the attack as if the two of them have practiced enough times against a common enemy. Right when Castiel jumps out of Michael's reach, Lucifer's blade stabs through the small of Castiel's back.

He mumbles a stifled pained sound. Dean looks up sharply and scrambles to his feet, hurrying to his side to help.

"Don't worry, I'm not hurt," Cas tells him calmly. Moving his hand away, the stab wound stops bleeding and the flesh grows back.

"We should get going." Dean tugs him.

"Michael doesn't let Adam go." Cas frowns.

"You can't obi-wan him to?" Dean suggests.

Cas raises an questioning eye brow.

Dean explains, "Use your God mojo and make him."

"Not so much on archangels." Cas admits.

"You know what else archangels can do?" Lucifer chirps, "Not even God's power is all invincible. We locked God's sister away once, just the four of us. We are two short, but Castiel, don't forget you are not Father, you are only playing Father. When I get out, and when you don't have the energy, I'll crunch you between my teeth."

Before Castiel can say anything, Dean already jumps before him, landing a punch on Lucifer's face.

Lucifer gets slammed to the wall by his side, and Dean breaks his wrist.

Dean turns to look -- it is definitely not his punch that blows Lucifer the Devil away, it is Cas holding out a hand like a palm cannon, holding Lucifer down.

Dean rushes to Cas's side. Cas cures him with the lightest touch of his other available hand.

"Can you cure Sam too?" Dean reminds him, too busy worrying about everyone and everything, "Wiping those Hell memories for him or whatever horror he has to live through."

Cas edges to Sam's soul, putting a gentle palm on that cloud of light. The bloody pink surface that looks awful lot like flayed skin in boiling water starts calming down. Dean watches the bubbling light cloud slowly ease down, almost reminded of how the baby Sammy used to be coaxed to sleep when he was still in a swaddle.

They manage to steal Adam too, in the end, with a small diversion strategy to draw Michael away from his vessel.

Michael growls at them angrily as Cas leaps out of the Cage with Dean -- along with Sam's soul and Adam's soul and broken body.

They can hear Lucifer unleash his anger on his brother and Michael returns the gesture. Dean is too busy watching Cas and their rescues to notice any more of their little activities.

Castiel is using his God power to heal the both of them. Patching Sam up with more delicacy than the rushed emergency patch a moment ago, then Adam. Fixing Adam's broken body almost takes as much as handling his soul, but Cas finishes the work in the end.

Raphael watches him do the work.

"Why do you care about them so much?" Raphael asks abruptly.

Castiel meets Dean's eyes before answering. He consider it for a good trunk of time before answering, "Because someone important to me taught me to, they changed me to care, so now I care for them, I care for all of them."

Dean can't hide his proud grin.

Raphael considers his answer, but to be honest, neither Dean or Castiel thinks he has understood anything. And they don't exactly find it surprising.

"What now?" Raphael wonders aloud.

"Obey me and give up Apocalypse, or you get locked in that Cage like Michael and Lucifer. Choose wisely." Cas demands.

It's the same tone Cas used that night about two years ago when Cas told the archangel "Today you're our bitch."

That is victory right there. They should have more of these, just as a reward for all the trouble of saving the world. Dean thinks. Or maybe things as small as a twenty-four hours straight peaceful sleeping. He can appreciate that too.

"Fine." Raphael says after moments of silence, kneeling down slowly with his head jerked high and unwilling. "This is good enough?"

"Attaboy." Dean beams, glancing at Cas.

"I'm glad." Castiel tells him, Raphael scoffs.

"But for your past attempt of splitting the angels, of starting a war, there will be punishments," Castiel continues to announce. "The punishment, is the rest of your life in the Cage."

What the hell? Dean gapes in surprise, staring at Cas.

His angel doesn't look back, only heading toward the Cage's door once again. Dark lines curling all over him. Dean's heart drops.

Raphael follows him slowly, eyes studying him with disgust.

"You know, there is a better place for creature like you -- Purgatory, because you are more monster than God, Castiel. You are always a monster and a disaster." Raphael spits, "I see who you really are. If anyone deserves to go to the Cage and rot for eternity, it's you. I'm doing this for the world."

Before Dean can react, before he even blinks, Raphael hauls Castiel on the shoulder, and throws both of them over the edge into the Cage.

Dean yells a desperate "NO!!", only to watch Castiel's body falling into the Cage.

The lid of the Cage closes automatically.

(**Warning**: include a small jump scare scene like classic horror movies would)

<br>

"No, no, no! Not again!" Dean pounds on the glass window of the Cage. The material is definitely not really glass, and it's most certainly single sided and soundproof.

He can do nothing but just watch the bully show displaying inside the glass container -- the brutal shark in tank show with Cas's body on the meat hook.

The three archangels form an ally within seconds. Cas's eyes shift between blue and black, Leviathan goo continuously falling out of him.

Lucifer jump-starts the first round of attack, with Michael -- now without Adam, he is more involved in the activity as well -- on Cas's left flank, and Raphael on his right. Castiel's body shakes like a winter leaf under their strike, the archangels stab him with the spiral blades, punch and kick and beat him from every direction.

Within seconds, Castiel's body slumps to the ground, blood and goo flowing from broken junctions and wounds. His eyes droop sluggishly with barely any light in the pupils.

*Cas, come on, stand up.*

Dean presses his palm on the glass wall, begging desperately.

The prayer must have reached him, for the angel turns his head toward the side of the wall Dean's near. The attacks from the three archangels are continuing, but he seems to forget about them at this moment.

Dean watches him hopelessly.

Castiel's broken lips move. Once, with three words. Then, with another three words.

Dean doesn't need to hear or know about lip language to recognize them.

*I'm sorry.*

*I love you.*

"NO!!" Dean punches the wall of the Cage with all his forces. His fists are covered with his own blood.

That is when Castiel's eyes brighten up. It lightens up the whole dark space like a sun, and it continues growing and glowing like an exploding supernova.

Dean shuts his eyes close but even then, the blue white lights pierce through his eyelid, burning his vision bright bloody red.

The sound is isolated inside the Cage, so is all the energy unleashed. The Cage barely shakes when the light recedes.

*Cas.*

Dean opens his eyes the moment he decides it's not going to blind him. He doesn't even realizing he's sobbing when tears falling down his cheek. He doesn't have the courage to look inside the Cage again for a long minute.

The Cage is an explosion debris. White smokes haven't fully dissipated, colors smudging all over the space -- red is blood, black is Leviathan goo, mixing together with white and blue light, like a dirty distained tragedy scene after massive deaths.

*I love you too.* Dean presses his forehead on the glass, breath uneven, tears shredding. His lips tremble with one word: "Cas."

A sudden bloody hand appears on the wall from inside, leaving a trace of bloody handprints as it pulls the body up slowly into the view. Matching Dean's hand on the other side.

Dean's heart pounds violently in his chest, so loud that he's sure the whole dark space would echo the sound of his heartbeat. He holds his breath, until Cas's face emerges, until Cas slowly, gradually climbs out of the Cage on his own. In one piece.

Dean wraps his arms around him immediately.

"I thought I lost you," he tells him. His voice still wet.

"I thought so too," Cas answers honestly.

"What happened?"

"I exploded, and the sharks killed each other, I think." Cas considers. "Looks like the energy from the Leviathans and the archangels cancelled each other out."

Dean holds the angel's blood stained cheeks in his palms, examining his features carefully. There is no dark veins with poisonous black worms crawling across, no dripping goo. No sign of Dick anywhere. And judging by the mess inside Cage, no sign of the other feathery dicks as well.

Dean can't help laughing, "We gotta work on your jokes, it's even worse than the crab one."

Cas opens his mouth to retort, but Dean doesn't give him any chance.

Dean presses his lips onto Castiel's, drinking in every last bitter sweet flavor in him. Cas returns the kiss as he does.

Dean closes his eyes, "Don't ever do that again."

Cas pauses, "The kissing?"

Dean chuckles, "No, jackass, the dying."

He pulls the angel back into his hold and doesn't let go.

<br>

They stay until the King of Hell finally can't take it any longer and declare the "public museum of the Cage" is officially closed at this time of the year.

They arrive home with Sam's soul in a suitcase and their half-brother in the back seat.

No one die today. No world-ending event scheduled for the next week. Everyone safe and sound with all monsters gone.

Talking about a big win.

Dean walks into Bobby's house giving the old man a tight hug. He gives Sam one too, after Cas puts his soul back.

Bobby asks how's the trip.

Dean says, with a wide grin, "Wouldn't recommend for honeymoon spots, not Heaven, not Hell, certainly not Purgatory. And we might have missed a few steps before that."

He winks at Cas, "We're working on that."

<br>

#### draft notes

"I should have said this earlier," Dean says, after finally dragging himself away from the entangled tongues. He looks at Cas in the eyes, the ocean-blue eyes looking him right back.

"You don't have to say it," Cas answers, "I heard your prayers."

"It's important," Dean insists, then takes a slow, long breath. "I love you."

Cas smiles as if the whole universe's light is gathering on him again.

"I love you too."
