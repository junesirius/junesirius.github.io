## Draft

### Claim info

#### Claim summary

Dean dies as a vampire and wakes up in Purgatory, trapped in the never-ending fight of killing and killed, hunting and hunted. Story of his life.

Cas is getting desperate. Going to the demons and monsters and reapers, willing to sacrifice anything to get down there and bring him back -- even if the cost is himself and there's no turning back. He turns himself into a monster and dies to go to Purgatory.

They find each other, and that's all they have in the relentless monsterland, being monsters themselves. They'll have to crawl their way out the ugly way, whatever the cost -- and Cas has to turn himself into something even worse.

#### Visual element

The color is mainly red and black, Dean covered in red, Cas in black. They're in a roughly built nest in Purgatory, Cas lies down, eyes closed, in a sleeping coma, clothes torn, wounds covered all over, broken wings on his back. Dean, with vampire fangs and bloodstains all over, leans in kissing him. There might be remains of other dead monsters or Leviathan goo around them on the ground.

### Posting

#### Posting summary

Aren't we all, monsters, in a way?

Some crawl out, some hide deep; some drink red, some bleed black.

In the pure, relentless monsterland, that's all they have -- being monsters themselves.

---

Died as a vampire and woke up in Purgatory with fangs, Dean has to crawl his way out the ugly way. And Castiel, in order to reach him, has to do something far, far worse -- to himself.

### Promo excerpt

Flashes of a blade shine in front of him, the teethy head flying up before dropping to the ground, rolling a few steps away, spilling a rain of black drops.

Castiel drags himself up, looking at the figure fighting off the creatures that are now starting to surround --

"Dean!" he cries out his name.

"Cas?" Dean answers automatically, looking in his direction, overjoyed, eyes sparkling.

But just that blink of distraction leaves enough of a fatal opening, the Leviathan he was fighting gets the jump on him, the multilayers of teeth opening wide, angling itself to bite down on Dean's shoulder. Dean is pinned to the ground, immobilized.

"NO!!" Castiel rages, eyes blazing bright. "Close your eyes!" he manages to shout at the last moment, can't see if Dean has covered his eyes or not, pouring his power onto that Leviathan that is going to hurt Dean. Castiel can't think or see anything else.

<br>

The Impala is parked in the back alley by the two-story building. The place doesn't have any lights on, but some of the windows are broken, the scent of copper and blood overflowing outside. One can only imagine how much blood must have been spilled inside the place for the outside to smell the same filth.

Sam and his grandfather hurry out of their van, rushing into the place, machete ready in their hands.

There are bodies without heads all the way from the stairs leading to the main hall. A long red carpet made of blood welcomes them.

Sam glances at the separated heads rolling around on the floor, seeing fangs dripping with blood. None of them move an inch anymore.

Samuel sees the same, catching his grandson's eyes, nodding at the only entrance leading to the larger opening. Both of them walk fast and quietly, in trained hunter steps.

The place is quiet. Too quiet. Even their silent footsteps might become the source of an echo.

And then, there is the sound of fighting again. Yelling and groaning, metal hitting metal, fists punching flesh.

They dash into the main ballroom. Sam tightens his grip on the machete.

Dean is covered in blood, his own or others' they do not know. The bigger vampire that bit him earlier has a smirk on his face, pulling Dean's collar and throwing him flying across the room like he weighs nothing. Dean lets out an angry growl, rolling on the ground in time to dodge a fierce direct blow to the face, grabbing the knife he dropped and jumping back on his feet, circling the other vampire, eyes bloody, pupils dilated, fangs out.

Sam hesitates. Samuel eyes him.

"Don't want to hurt Dean by accident," Sam whispers, not moving an inch closer, just standing there, watching them with white knuckles around the machete.

Dean ducks and dodges for two or three more rounds, before getting wrestled and tripped by the other vampire, legs entangled, unable to move easily. That monster is so much stronger than him. And by the look of the fight, the way he swings his arms and fists, several hundred years of living isn't teaching him nothing.

Dean can't breathe, fingers fumbling on the face of the bigger man, scratching the edge of his eye sockets, leaving bloody fingernail marks, but the other monster does not back away. Dean's movements slow, arms slumping to the ground eventually.

The other vampire lets the grip loose, Sam catches the break and marches forward, but he's still two steps too far away when the vampire dives back with the silver knife Dean left behind, cutting his head off in a clean move. Sam's machete slides through the vampire's throat right in the next second.

Two heads roll away from their bodies, blood spilling everywhere, mostly on Sam's face.

Sam flinches sharply, staring at the heads and bodies, gasping loudly. "Dean!"

Dean's eyes are still wide open, amber green, reflecting the shifting colors of the colored glass windows on the high ceiling. And then the lights go out. The fangs are still out, ugly, layering over his own teeth.

So much for going out swinging.

So much for half-retiring and apple-pie life.

"Oh my God!" Sam kneels down by his brother's body, hands on his shoulder, inhaling heavily.

Samuel looks away, swallowing hard.

Sam helps him close the eyes. And knits his head back to his body, later. With floss.

He burns his brother's body on a pyre. And then drives away in his car.

The town is left behind in the rearview mirror.

Soon, the whole state of Illinois is left behind miles away.

The vampire nest was set on fire before they left. Any other bodies or signs of life are all burned to ashes.

<br>

Dean wakes up in a gasp, touching his neck reflexively. The skin on his neck is intact, his head is still connected to his body.

"What the hell?" He looks around. The sky is grey, the trees all half dying around him. The whole place creeps him out, but the most creepy thing is, he seems to be still kicking and running.

He touches his upper gum. The fangs are still pointy, mostly hidden, for now.

"Okay? So not dead, but still a fucking vamp," He mutters to himself, disgusted.

Eyeing around again, his hunter's instinct kicks in just in time. His fingers fumble to the back of his belt, finding nothing but air. His body moves before his ears catch the sound -- something jumps on him from behind.

Dean twists around, elbowing it in the face, arms wrapping its neck from behind, pressing his full weight on its throat until it stops moving. Dean drops the body and recognizes the face of a young boy -- the young vampire boy he sure as hell cut the head off no more than a few hours ago, before he somehow got sent into this weird land.

"You're dead." Dean frowns at the motionless -- dead before, probably just passed out now -- vampire body, thinking aloud. Realization dawns on him. "Which means I'm dead too. Goddammit!"

Dean kicks the trunk of a tree closest to him with all his force, frustrated. "Fuck!"

It's just a vampire case, an everyday job. He did not expect to check out just like that. Not today. But apparently he did.

He kicks again, as if it could make him feel better. "So what? This is some monsterland dead vamps go to for the afterparties and I'm stuck here forever?"

No one answers his question, except for some more creatures lurking closer because of the noise.

Seems like it's more than just vampires then, Dean concludes, thinking he sees something that definitely looks like a werewolf and another like a wendigo. Every freaking monster he and his brother and every hunter has ever killed would be here then. And if they remember him in the whatever afterlife memory they still carry, they sure as hell would be thrilled to see him hanging around with them.

That's when he picks a direction, and starts running into the creepy woods. The growls and howling of every kind of monster that ever existed rise around him like the most dedicated freaky monster symphony.

He has nothing but his hands and feet. And his fangs -- weirdly comforting now, come to think of it.

It's gonna be a bloody long eternity.

<br>

Sam is two states over when Cas drops by.

The case looks like an angelic weapon case. Sam calls for him in a prayer. People are being killed for telling the truth.

"Looks like it's your department?" Sam points at a picture of Gabriel's Horn of Truth when the angel shows up.

Castiel flies away and back in two seconds. Nothing angelic in the town, he tells him.

Sam snorts. "Where did you look?"

"Everywhere." Castiel looks him in the eyes, then looks around. It's a single-bed motel room, the bedsheet on the only bed unruffled. One duffel bag on the ground.

"Where is your brother?" Cas frowns.

"Dean's dead," Sam tells him, flat.

"What?!" Castiel snaps. "You prayed for me for a possible horn but didn't think of letting me know that Dean's dead?"

Sam looks at him, also frowning. "What's there to pray for if he's already gone?"

Cas opens his mouth, in disbelief, wetting his lips, but not saying anything. He shakes his head, walking several steps away, his back to Sam.

"How?" His voice is low and grave.

"Vampires," Sam says, emotionless. "It was a vampire nest. We went in there too late. Dean killed most of them but got taken down by the largest one. I killed it after it got Dean."

"You let Dean go into a vampire nest all by himself? Without backup?" Cas turns around, furious.

"Dean volunteered," Sam says it like it's obvious.

"And why would he do such a stupid thing?" Cas's eyes narrow.

"Because he's a vampire himself."

That is the ultimate bomb drop.

Castiel stares at him, eyes widened in extreme shock -- if Sam didn't know better, he'd say Cas almost looks horrified, if angels can ever feel horror.

And then with the sound of wings flapping, Castiel is gone.

Sam goes back to the case.

<br>

Heaven is heavily guarded, these days. With Raphael's troops and his loyalists. Castiel's army is on the far periphery of Heaven, still assembling but far too few in number and power. Going into the private chamber area where the souls are secured is nothing short of a suicide mission. He goes anyway.

Sneaking into the white corridor bathed in blinding light from all directions, he looks for the names on the doors. With everyone that has a last name "Winchester", he finds John and Mary, he finds Henry, their distant cousins from other branches, unrelated people who share the same last name. But there is no Dean. In all human history, with all the humans named "Winchester", there is no "Dean" in Heaven, born 1979, died 2010. Not in John and Mary's chamber, not anywhere.

"What's the matter, lost your little human pet?" A patrol angel spots him, approaching. Raphael's man.

Castiel slides his angel blade into grip, ready to fight. The angel throws himself at him, young and inexperienced. Castiel stabs his blade out, right into his heart. The angel bursts into bright light and collapses into nothing but a pile of meat suit.

Castiel sighs, eyeing the corridor that doesn't have the person he came looking for one last time, picking up the blade and rushing to the other side.

More patrols hear the noise, gathering in this direction. He has to leave the place in a rush.

<br>

Crowley is not happy to see him. Not at all, to say the least.

"Why are you here again?" He's halfway poking a monster's brain, electrical pod in his gloved hand, blood stains on his apron.

"I need to find the Purgatory. NOW!" Castiel snaps.

"Great! That makes the two of us." Crowley makes his voice sound cheerful. "Then why don't you go ahead with your quest or whatever and bring me more Alphas, we'll figure that out soon."

Castiel takes two steps forward, right in front of Crowley, almost nose to nose growling into his face. "You don't understand. Soon is not enough, I need it NOW!"

Crowley eyes him curiously. "What's the rush? Already the checkmate time upstairs?"

Castiel looks away.

"Not the war then." Crowley reads his face. "Then must be the Winchesters. What, they have a sudden interest in the place as well or something?"

Cas shifts uneasily, moving farther away, fluttering. "No."

"My my, can't be one of them already gone there, can they?" Crowley makes an exaggerated tsk. "No wonder you can't wait a single second. Always too fond of those two you can't focus on anything now, are you?"

Cas glares at him, snapping harshly. "Yes! Dean's there! Okay? Satisfied?"

The demon hums, definitely sounding like he's enjoying himself too much. "All the more reasons to poke around the Alphas, don't you think? Chop, chop, Feathers, don't want to make your boyfriend wait down there for too long."

Castiel thins his lips, lines tight. "Do you have more information from your side?" His head tilting towards that little creature Crowley tied to the stretcher.

The demon casually gives it a shock as he speaks, the monster moans at the electric strike. Crowley listens to the sound like it's music. "Nothing yet. I'll drop a line when I find anything --"

"Good." Castiel cuts in. Within a blink, he flies away.

Crowley puffs out a laugh. "Talk about motivations."

<br>

#### Act 2 Ext. Purgatory (Dean; monsters); multiple (Cas; alpha vamp, Ajay)

> (Dean POV → Cas POV)
>
> Dean fights, tries to come back but can't go through human portal
>
> Cas finds rogue reaper Ajay, goes purgatory as angel

Dean is so tired. His body does not wear out, but his mind is way too overloaded.

He doesn't know the days and nights. There is no sun or moon, there is no time. There is just hunting and hunted, chasing and chased, killing and killed.

His mind is blurred with the repetition of the same sets of movements -- being attacked from all directions, individually or in groups, at once or in turns, monsters of all kinds, then his body goes into autopilot mode. He doesn't need to think much about any movement, and given time, the monsters would all become a pile of flesh and blood by his feet. Sometimes even he is surprised himself that he's the last one left standing. He staggers away from the slaughterhouse, moving to the next.

Call it survival instinct or whatever, he's fighting his ass out of here.

There must be a way out. Dean tells himself.

If the past thirty years of living this life have taught him anything, it's the fact that any problem can have a solution. And now he has a problem -- stuck in this monsterland afterlife as a vampire, so he just has to find a solution to leave here and fix himself. And hopefully, fix Sam too.

The last glint of memory flashes by and he sees Sam's face twitching as he was bitten, and later, as he was being killed.

And fix Cas too, now that he really thinks about it. There is definitely something wrong with Cas too -- without seeing the angel for almost a year, the things he said about not having the luxury of caring about torturing a kid, or caring about anything, really. Whatever that angel civil war thing is, Cas has changed. They'll figure that out too, together. Once he's back in the game.

God, so many problems.

Dean waves the new bone blade he just snatched from a dead vampire, feeling its weight in his hands, sensing some comfort in having a real weapon finally.

"Okay," he tells himself, "one thing at a time then."

He spots a stream at the edge of the woods, and starts following it, moving downstream.

<br>

As it turns out, if an angel really puts their mind into hunting, they can be a damn good hunter -- the best hunter in the world that a hunter could ever be, actually.

The vicious things give off a dark vibe, not as evil as demons, but also stink so much that they differ from humans. Castiel can sense them, pick them out from the crowd like peas from rice. He drags random werewolves, shapeshifters, vampires, or djinns out of their nests. Sometimes he drops them at Crowley's lab; other times, he fries their brains himself when reading their minds.

He doesn't have the luxury of taking things slowly now, Castiel tells himself. Every minute wasted on Earth, every minute spent talking to a monster when he can just reach inside and read, he thinks of Dean in Purgatory, being hunted and chased by millions of monsters. He thinks of Dean trapped there, alone, as a vampire, and dying.

Castiel's eyes glow with blue-white light, the two vampires in front of him vaporize in an instant. They don't know anything about Purgatory or their Alpha anyway, or if they do, they refuse to give him up. Castiel decides they aren't worth his patience.

"I think that's far enough, Angel." A low male voice sounds behind him.

Castiel turns around, the grace in his eyes barely receding. He has the angel blade ready.

The man has a strong build, decent suits and outfits -- at first glance, he could fit perfectly into some upper-class gathering, drinking afternoon tea and talking horse racing with fancy ladies and gentlemen of Old Britain. Except the tea is probably made of human blood. Castiel can see the fangs just as clearly as he can see the man's skin and clothes.

"Alpha vampire," Castiel says, the closest thing to a greeting.

"You killed enough of my children." The vampire speaks in a slow, almost elegant tone -- the tone of someone who has been living for centuries. "I understand you want to schedule an appointment."

"Where is Purgatory?" Castiel asks, the only thing he cares about.

"Why would you want to know?" the Alpha vampire asks, almost politely.

But Castiel's patience is wearing thin. He takes a few steps closer. "Would you believe me if I say it's actually to save a friend? One who's been turned into one of you?"

The thought of Dean being a vampire hurts just as much as knowing he's in Purgatory. Cas thinks, almost winces at the thought, but makes sure it doesn't show. He shuts that train of thought off. They'll figure that out later, once he finds the place and finds him.

"Dean Winchester, is it?" The Alpha studies his face. Castiel keeps his expression straight. As much as the uneasiness of being scrutinized, he holds his face blank, staring back at the vampire.

"So you know him," Castiel says as an answer.

"Not just know him. I saw through his mind as he saw through mine," the vampire states flatly.

That makes Castiel squint. He tilts his head. "What do you mean?"

The Alpha vampire smiles. "Our minds -- think of it as a hive. I can feel all of my children, no matter where they are, and they can feel me. So when Dean was one of us, he was no exception."

"Was?" Cas can't help noticing.

"Purgatory isn't exactly a signal-covered zone, you might say."

Castiel swallows, pushing down hard on the thoughts that Dean might be dead -- that's why the connection breaks, dead even in the afterlife, dead in every sense -- pushing away the contemplation of where he would go next. He doesn't have time for this sick twisting feeling curling low in his stomach. He pushes it all down to the bottom.

Castiel raises his angel blade higher, standing in a more menacing stance. "Do you know how to get there?"

"I might," the vampire says, unshaken by the killing look in the angel's eyes or his blade, knowing far too well how negotiation and leverage usually work.

"And?" Castiel tries hard not to sound too desperate but fails.

"While I can't take you there personally, I know someone who can. It's no problem." The vampire looks him in the eyes, grinning wider. "Now, shall we talk terms?"

It is not a good deal, technically. Castiel knows that too well, and so does the Alpha vampire. But he gets what he needs, so he gives the monster what he asks for -- not to hurt any other vampires like he did before, in exchange for a name that hopefully is the real deal and knows the pathway to Purgatory.

Castiel gives him his word. "But I can't promise other hunters will do the same, the vampires would still get killed."

The Alpha shrugs. "A few of you kill a few of us, some of my children feed on some humans -- that's called balance. That's nature. Only what you were doing -- wiping out the board to get to me -- that's something I cannot allow. I have to protect my children, that you must understand."

Castiel does not answer.

They part ways.

<br>

The taxi driver is sitting in the driver's seat of a yellow cab, reading a newspaper, parked in a back alley in Warsaw, Missouri. Castiel knocks on the window.

"Ajay?"

The man looks up. "You know my name."

"And what you do." Castiel gives him a sharp look.

"What, you want a ride?" Ajay glances back, gesturing at the glowing "taxi" sign on top of the car.

"A ride, yes, but going down." Castiel says plainly, "To Purgatory. Reapers have the way, and rogue ones do that for a profit. Like you."

Ajay steps out of the car, eyeing him up and down. "And why would an angel want to go to Purgatory?"

"That is my business," Castiel states flatly.

Ajay shrugs. "Sure. And if you get killed down there, also not my business. Not exactly having insurance around here."

Castiel nods. "I understand. One ticket down, two tickets up. How does that work?"

Ajay raises an eyebrow. "I didn't say I'd do that yet. What's your payment?"

Castiel frowns. "What do you want?"

The rogue reaper curls his lips. "A little fuel in stock would be nice, just in case some days I need it, as good as human souls."

Castiel glares at him. "You want my grace?"

"Not all of it. Just a tiny bit. You'll grow back, won't you?" The slimy reaper conjures a small glass vial into his palm, holding it out. "So, do we have a deal?"

It's not a large vial, to be honest, but still, losing grace -- trading it -- is unholy. There are so many spells others could cast with the grace he gives away to harm him, or even kill him. And if Ajay is corrupted by Raphael and this is his way of getting to him, then...

But Dean is waiting. Cas's mental image shifts. Dean has been in Purgatory for so long, and if he doesn't reach him soon, if he's too late, then... death in the afterlife -- Would that mean gone forever? That he would never see him again?

Castiel grabs the vial and uses the angel blade to cut his left forearm. The sparkling light of grace flows from the wound, filling the small glass container. His human body inhales automatically at the prickling pain.

He covers the wound with his other palm once the vial is full. The skin is healed in an instant, but the loss of grace still makes him stumble slightly, as if his legs can't quite hold his weight for a moment, or his head becomes too heavy and dizzy -- not unlike a human losing just enough blood to be lightheaded before turning vital.

He hands the vial back, ignoring the uncomfortable sensation.

"Lead the way," he tells him sternly.

<br>

#### Act 3 Ext. Purgatory (Dean, Cas)

> (Dean POV → Cas POV)
>
> Cas goes to purgatory with Ajay's deal, see Dean briefly, attacked by too many leviathans (Naomi: took a lot angels to fetch Cas)
>
> both of them save each other against leviathans, Cas wants Dean out, but Dean buys him time to let Cas out of the same portal, Dean left behind in Purgatory facing monsters again

The end of the stream leads to an opening. The woods are sparse. The water looks clean -- cleaner, relatively speaking.

Dean drops to his knees to scoop up some of the clear liquid to drink. The coolness washes down the dirt in his gullet, making him breathe easier. He washes his face and hands too, but doesn't bother cleaning all the other blood stains on his clothes or skin.

In the reflection, Dean sees a face he can barely recognize, with stubble covering his jaw, dark bags around his eyes, bruises and cuts here and there. And the fangs, the ugly uneven fangs that jut out, visible whenever he opens his mouth, refusing to contract however hard he demands his body to. Dean slaps the water surface to break the image, to not have to look at that face again -- the face of a monster he and his family have devoted to killing.

He leaves the water's edge, heading toward the middle of the opening where, according to some of the old creatures he killed earlier, there would sometimes be a disturbance in the air flow. No one here knows where the stir comes from, but if Dean has to guess, this is where the veil is the weakest.

If a long shot is all he can get, then Dean would take it. He walks toward the said location, waving his blade at the nothingness in the empty air, observing, thinking, waiting. The air is unmoved, but his gut is giving him a drag, the hair on the back of his head rising -- some weird vamp hyper-sense or whatever it is, Dean's expecting something or someone approaching.

Dean stares at the middle of the ground hard, blade in hand, counting his own pounding heartbeat. Waiting.

<br>

The back alley where the taxi is parked is connected directly to a small opening surrounded by four painted walls. The drawings are wild and overly colorful, dizzying and frantic. Looking at them for too long might make one's head ache if one were human. Castiel looks at them for a moment and then looks away.

"You have thirty minutes. I'll see you where I drop you. Don't miss the ride, alright?" Ajay gives him a sly grin, starting the ritual without waiting for an answer.

The air swirls, sand and dust rising from the ground, creating a small sandstorm. In front of him, the wall painting comes alive, opening up and swallowing him whole.

In the blink of an eye, the surroundings shift. The walls and streets disappear into bleak woods and a grey sky. Monsters growl in the distance. Except --

They're not really in the distance.

Black smoke drops to the ground around him like debris from an asteroid crashing onto a planet. Creatures with no face but all teeth emerge from the smoke, surrounding him and shrinking the circle fast.

"What?--" That is the only syllable Castiel manages to make before the attacking begins.

They are fast, and strong. So strong even as an angel he can't match their strength. Castiel is thrown into the air by this one and that, sharp black teeth sinking into his flesh. He does not know if it's his vessel or his grace that is being devoured. He screams in pain and feels his strength draining rapidly.

"We are Leviathans." One of them enjoys too much in its feast on him, it actually bothers to answer his question.

Castiel gasps in disbelief. The pre-Biblical monsters that could devour every living thing that ever existed from the Creation, devour a whole planet and maybe even the entire worlds if they have the chance -- God had to create a whole Purgatory to lock them away. He has heard of them like a rumor story Balthazar would talk about when he was in a good storytelling mood, but Castiel never thought they were more than a story. And now, he's in the center of their dinner table.

For a split second, Castiel thinks this might be his way of dying -- his true and final death. Becoming the shared food of the Leviathans, without having a chance of finding Dean or saving him from this place. His gut twists. Cas focuses all his attention on the scrap of grace he has left, trying -- thinking -- about exploding himself one last time just to get rid of these filthy creatures that live in the same dimension as Dean. That is when he feels the grips and teeth on his body loosen.

Flashes of a blade shine in front of him, a teethy head flying up before dropping to the ground, rolling a few steps away, spilling a rain of black drops.

Cas hauls himself upright, looking at the figure fighting off the creatures that are now starting to surround --

"Dean!" he cries out his name unbelievably.

"Cas?" Dean answers automatically, looking in his direction, overjoyed, eyes sparkling.

But just that blink of distraction leaves enough of a fatal opening, the Leviathan he was fighting gets the jump on him, layered teeth opening wide, angling itself to bite down on Dean's shoulder. Dean is pinned to the ground, immobilized.

"NO!!" Castiel rages, eyes blazing bright. "Close your eyes!" he manages to shout at the last moment, can't see if Dean has covered his eyes or not, pouring his power onto that Leviathan that is going to hurt Dean. Castiel can't think or see anything else.

When the light fades, Dean pants heavily. The Leviathans are still there, even more than before. The one bearing Cas's angelic rage backs off a few steps, but it doesn't seem to be hurt, not fatally anyway. It spreads its hideous jaws, laughing wide and ugly. Its voice as sharp as its teeth, and it says, smirkingly, "Rock beats scissors, Leviathan beats angel."

There is no way they can defeat them, no way to even get a head start to run away from them long enough to reach the rendezvous point the rogue reaper promised.

"Dean!" Cas is desperate, doesn't even have time to check if Dean is hurt. His vision is blocked by more apparently irritated Leviathans attracted by the light show. There is no way he can make it out alive, the monsters are obviously more interested in him than anything else, but Dean, if Dean can make it to the rendezvous point, then maybe --

"Dean! You have to go! I'll distract them! The -- the ride is coming soon --" The attacks already resume, the angel blade is doing very little, more teeth and black goo sinking into his flesh and bones, Castiel screams in his true voice.

<br>

The yell of pain is the first thing that catches Dean's attention. The familiar trench coat comes next.

The black smoke turns into monsters he's never seen before, all teeth and no face, the ugliest bastards one can ever imagine. But luckily, it seems beheading does the trick, just like all the other creatures in this place -- at least temporarily.

Cutting his way through the tightening ring, he sees Cas. Being torn apart alive, shredded by the teeth. Blood and grace spilling from the wounds, he can't even tell what's the vessel and what's the angel.

Cas.

For that blink of time, emotions pour into him so fast Dean's almost dizzy with feelings, his steps stumble for the briefest instant, then he immediately aims the blade towards the closest uglyass thing.

Adrenaline pumping in his temple, blade rising and falling, heads rolling, black blood splattering, it almost becomes mechanical.

"Cas." Dean breathes out the name, looking him up and down, overwhelmed by the joy of seeing him again. But there is no time for catching up, no time for a single word to say how damn glad he is to see him, and also how pissed he is that these uglyass things showed up and sticking around the moment Cas appeared, and now they are in a bigger mess than handling wolves and vamps.

When he is pinned to the ground, watching the black goo dripping onto his face and the teeth of the monster ready to take a bite on him, with the last bit of strength, Dean casts one last glimpse at Cas, who actually seems okay and meets him in the eyes -- the eyes so deep and pained he loses the ability to read what's in them. Despite the fresh bleeding wounds and cuts on his face and body, he can still straighten up and walk over. Alive. Cas is okay. Dean tries to pull a smile at him, only to see his eyes filled with the familiar bright color. He shuts his eyes just in time. The pressure on top of him releases.

But it is not over -- it is far from over. The monsters back off briefly, but they do not leave. Immune to angel power even, apparently. They took the divine wrath like a bear to a pebble thrown onto its head.

Circling around them only to look for the next opportunity to attack -- they even seem to be intelligent enough to be strategic. Monsters with brains, for fuck's sake. There is no way the both of them can get out of here alive. And he's not going to let Cas "be the distraction" as he said. Not again.

The air in the opening flares not too far away from them. Even closer to the full circle of the Leviathans.

"Dean! You HAVE to go now!" Cas's voice is mixed with the shrieking high pitch of unrecognizable frequencies and human words.

"I'm not leaving without you!" Dean shouts back, fighting his way towards the angel.

The blade cuts through the monsters, leaving bodies tumbling around them, but they're gluing back together and catching up fast. The one that still has its teeth on Cas's leg, Dean makes sure it gets chopped into even smaller chunks, and kicks its body far away.

"Come on! I got you!" He hauls Cas up, slinging his arm over his shoulder, rushing toward the lighted exit.

And then he stumbles, feeling a pull on his own legs -- a monster is dragging him back. Dean loses balance and falls to the ground, but they're so close now. Within two steps to the exit at most, he shoves Cas forward.

"No, Dean!" That is the last of Cas's voice he catches before the lights are out. No more exits.

Dean lets out a long breath. At least one of them is out.

Turning around to face the monsters on his tail, he raises his bone blade that is as long and sharp as their teeth.

Dean creeps a smile. "Game time?"

(**Warning words** before the chapter: Body horror and minor grotesque content)

<br>

Castiel tumbles onto the cement ground, his body crashing onto the concrete of the real world. His mind takes a second to register.

He looks behind him frantically. But there is just air, walls, the stillness of a small town's back-alley. Earth.

No dying tree, no monster, no Dean.

"No, no, no, no, no!" Castiel gets to his feet, fists punching the brightly painted wall, as if it can tear apart the bricks to reveal the opening again. As if Dean is waiting right on the other side of the wall.

"You have to take me back again, Ajay!" he calls out behind him.

"I don't think Ajay can take you anywhere now." The voice makes his blood cold. Castiel looks back, realizing belatedly the whole place's air is buzzing with an archangel's power. The street lamps overhead flicker once and blow up.

"Raphael." Castiel turns around slowly, his back pressed against the wall. Cornered.

Raphael is in a female vessel this time, the woman's body a few inches shorter than him. But the true form behind that vessel's face is still gigantic and blindingly bright.

Castiel reaches inward, testing his grace. The fuel in the tank is so low that he can barely feel it, the energy flowing sluggishly like he's trying to fetch out the last drop of water in a bottle. Zero chance this time then.

Raphael steps towards him, looking up at his face. The vial with his essence that he gave Ajay not long ago is in her grip, his grace swirling gently inside the glass, soft and bright. The rogue reaper's body is limp by his cab on the ground, eyes burned out. Two other angels stand by the body.

"You killed him." Castiel shifts his eyes from the body back to the archangel, thinking hard, buying time.

"Thanks to you." Raphael shakes the vial slowly, the grace inside spinning faster like a tiny whirlpool. "This is beyond stupid even for you, Castiel. I'm disappointed, to be honest. I wasn't expecting you to be so... reckless. But in the end, daring to fight against me already tells as much."

His vessel's heart pounds hard and fast inside his chest. Is he human enough now for the sigil to work as he wants? Cas wonders, feeling the throbbing pain in the tears on his legs and over the whole body, wetness dripping from the wound. He takes the bet. The angel blade slides into his palm behind his back.

"What are you going to do to me?" he looks at the archangel, questioning, not letting his eyes blink, not showing any fear that the other might be looking for.

"Kill you, of course." Raphael is only two steps away now. "I don't see God or Balthazar or any of your monkey pets helping you this time. I'll kill your beloved Winchesters, too, rest assured."

Cas swallows reflexively, at the bare mention of the word "Winchester". His thought drifts away to the look Dean threw at him right before he pushed him out, letting himself be pulled away by the monsters, facing all the Leviathans by himself. Oh God. Cas winces.

Raphael must notice that. The female face shows a slight hint of joy. "Feeling the fear now, finally? A little too late for that." The archangel raises her blade. "Goodbye, Castiel."

Cas ducks aside, showing the angel banishing sigil he was drawing on the wall with his own blood while talking. Pressing his palm to the center of the sigil, it brightens up, blasting Raphael and the other two followers away. The blast gives Cas a small heated burn on the side of his body that is closest to the wall, but that is all it does.

The small alley returns to darkness and silence like there were never any angels there. Castiel leans back against the bloody wall, slumping slightly, rubbing his own eyes, ignoring the dripping blood from the sliced palm.

Dean is still in Purgatory, he is exhausted and low in grace, and the only being that can smuggle him into Purgatory is dead. He needs a plan, but he can't think of one.

Castiel opens his eyes, looking up at the sky that is darkening slowly as the night falls, desperate. Almost like how a human would pray. Dean would know what to do if he were here, he always could think of something. A next step, a joke to cheer up the team, an idea, something.

What would Dean do?

Cas gets an idea.

<br>

#### Act 2 Int. Bobby's house - Night (Cas, Bobby, Sam)

> (Cas → Bobby POV)
>
> Cas turns himself to monster (disturbing form, distorted wings etc.), death wish for sacrifice, gets killed by Sam as he wants, goes to purgatory

Cas appears in the middle of Bobby's living room. Bobby jumps, almost shoots him with the gun by his hand. And Sam actually does, from far across the room on the couch. The bullet pierces through his shoulder, flying out the other side, sinking into the wall behind him.

"Sam?!" Cas gasps in pain, staggering back two steps from the impact. Blood streams down from the new wound.

Bobby rushes to him.

"Sorry, panicked," Sam says, stuffing the gun back into his belt.

"You need to wear a bell next time," Bobby says, now standing in front of him, eyeing the wound that is making his coat a mess.

The comment actually pulls Cas's lip up a tiny little bit. "Dean said that too."

The bullet hole remains a hole under close inspection. Looking back into the angel's eyes, Bobby's frown deepens, "Why ain't it healed yet?"

Cas presses a palm on the shoulder, vainly trying to stop the burning and pungent sensation, but it does nothing, blood seeping through his fingers. More exhausted than before, he starts to think it might have been a bad idea to come here. "My grace, I'm drained," he has to admit.

"You were in a fight?" Sam asks.

"Not just any fight."

Cas tells them about Purgatory, and Ajay, and Raphael. He manages to leave out the parts with the Alpha and Crowley, deciding it's unimportant. Bobby helps wrap his shoulder and the worst wounds on his legs with some bandage and Cas says thank you.

"Wow." Sam blinks at his eventful afternoon.

"I know." Cas looks down, sinking into a chair by Bobby's dining table, resting his wounded arm on the armrest.

"No, I mean, you actually went to Purgatory for Dean?" Sam looks amazed. "Not even I would think of something crazy like that, I don't think anyone ever would."

"Well, maybe you should!" Cas stares at him. "He's your brother, and he needs our help."

Sam's face is unmoved. Cas squints. "What happened to you? You used to care about Dean a lot more."

Sam shrugs. "Nothing." Then, he returns the stare. "What happened to you, Castiel? You used to care about Dean a lot less."

Cas looks away, uneasy, eyes lingering on the window half covered by the flowing curtain. It's all dark outside now. Is Purgatory darker at night or would the sky there remain the same lifeless bleach and grey forever? When was the last time Dean saw sunlight?

"Seems like you two just balanced out then," Bobby comments behind them. Sam huffs a laugh, Cas does not.

"I just want to fix this," Cas says, voice quieter. He didn't tell them every single detail about the monsters and Leviathans, and how Dean looked during that brief moment they met down there. The hunter's eyes flashed with relief and were shortly covered by anger again. Cas soaks himself in the image and the look.

"What happened to 'The dead should stay dead' and not upsetting the natural order?" Sam raises his brows.

Cas drags his thought back, feeling the bone-deep exhaustion and pained sensation all over him numbing and spreading, sprawling like needles across every inch of muscle and skin. Do humans always feel like this when they are hurt? Does Dean?

"It's... he's just in another place. We can still bring him back." This is what Cas manages to land on. Not exactly an answer, but hopefully it's enough.

"Listen, Angel, I want Dean back as much as you do," Bobby chimes in. "But how? You said yourself, there ain't no elevator going down there and no more taxi driver to help. Any genius idea now?"

"I was hoping to find some answer here." Cas looks at the old hunter, pointedly.

Bobby blinks. "I ain't get nothin'."

Castiel nods at the mountainous books on the floor and on the shelves. "Your books might."

<br>

Cas pauses on a page, reading it over, and rereading it. His fingers rub the corner of the yellowed page belonging to a black grimoire.

He stands up and walks towards the cabinet where Bobby keeps most of his spell ingredients and pots and pans. The other two men look up from their books.

"Find anything you want to share with the class?" Bobby's eyes follow his steps.

Cas doesn't answer, just walking closer to the cabinet. His steps are still slightly shaky, the bandage over the gash on his calf leaks hints of black, the one on his shoulder red. He reaches the top shelf with his uninjured hand.

Bobby grabs the book that Cas was reading. Cas already knows what he's going to hear.

"Are you out of your mind? You'd be a damn fool even *think* about doing THAT?!" Bobby snaps, passing the book to Sam.

"Figured you might say that." Cas doesn't stop moving, not looking back.

"Then you know how stupid this is! Cas, come on, there gotta be another way."

"What if there *is* no other way?" Cas grabs three jars the size of vases, sets them on the table, and starts rummaging through the drawers. His face is calm for the first time since he entered the room. Eyes focused. "What if we wait too long looking for a different solution only to be too late for Dean?"

"You don't know what the spell would do to you!" Bobby tries again.

At that, Cas looks up. "Technically, I do. It would turn me into a monster. Because that's the point, isn't it? Only monsters can go to Purgatory, so it makes sense if I become one, then I can go and find Dean."

"After you are dead! And we don't know if there is any way to change you back!" Bobby walks over, putting his hands on Cas's wrist, stopping him for a moment. "Goddammit, stop and think for a sec, will ya? Do you think Dean would want that? You, become a monster?"

Cas glares back. "I don't know! I don't know what Dean would want because he's not here! Why don't you let me do this so I can ask him myself?"

Bobby snaps with more exhaustion. "How on earth did the Winchesters get that issue infected you too? Just can't wait to sacrifice yourself for one another, you're just as bad as their third brother now, maybe even worse, you know that?"

Cas looks down at his hands. "I have to." That's all he says.

Bobby loosens his grip, turning back to Sam. "You wanna help me out here or what?"

Sam blinks. "For the record, I think the plan makes sense, reasonably speaking." At Bobby's stare, he hurriedly adds, "The 'only monsters can go to Purgatory' part. I mean, there's indeed some more details we need to figure out."

Bobby squints at him, unbelievably. "Great, that makes me the weird one in the room. I'm gonna grab some drink then. You two knock yourself out doing... whatever you wanna do, why do I bother saving your sorry asses."

He leaves the room, heading for the kitchen.

<br>

The three ingredients on the list: demon blood, monster blood, and unholy man's blood -- the mixed blood so blasphemous it could turn the most holy being into a monster.

Castiel goes to fetch demon blood and monster blood, Sam says he'd take care of the last one.

They meet back at Bobby's after a few hours, each with jars of blood in hand. Bobby eyes them, both more bloody than before.

"Do I even want to know how you got that human blood?" Bobby glances at Sam but looks away shortly.

"Probably not," Sam answers too quickly.

Cas frowns. "Did you kill a man?"

Sam just hands him the jar. "Like I said, you probably don't want to know."

Cas looks at him for a few moments, then he shifts his gaze back to the ingredients. He doesn't ask further.

The mixture of the blood has a color so dark that it's more black than red. Cas enchants the spell as the black grimoire instructs. The blood still looks the same, dirty and stinking -- the smell of corruption and abomination.

They look at him.

"Cas, you sure about this? Like, really sure? This thing looks like no fun." Bobby frowns deep, all the lines on his weathered face crinkled with concern.

"I'm doing this," Cas says simply, unwavering, unbothered by the smell of the liquid or what it would do to him. His mind can only see the place with the bleachy sky and dying woods, a figure with torn flannel running in it, with only a blade in his hands, facing the whole world of monsters created from the beginning of time, no way out, no rest, not even a damn soul to talk to. "I'm ready." He says. He can't be more ready.

"Alright then," Bobby pushes the jar towards him.

The dark surface of the mixed blood reflects his vessel's face -- the face he's worn for so long Cas already registers as his own. And soon, he may lose the form.

"You may not want to witness the next part," Castiel tells Bobby and Sam, grabbing the syringe he prepared earlier, drawing the liquid up to inject into his own vein.

Bobby widens his eyes once more. "Thought drinking that thing was bad enough."

"Faster this way." Cas draws a full syringe of blood and pumps it in stoically, then the next. Eyes locked on the needle, teeth gritted. His face grimaces with each pump.

Bobby hesitates at the threshold before heading to the other room. "Call me if you need anything."

"I can stay," Sam offers.

Castiel just continues the motion until the jar is emptied.

And then he waits.

The boiling sensation starts from the arm, as the contaminative liquid touches his own blood -- worse than the strongest acid and molten metal pouring onto a human body. And it moves deeper into the system. Like a flash, it reaches the heart and pumps into every part of the body.

Castiel drops the syringe and screams. His body collapses to the floor, eyes wide open but he can't see anything, the world shifts in front of him to a darkened blur.

The sensation is so intense that the Leviathans' attacks in Purgatory are like nothing but tickles. It's not just pain, it's transformation. It's like his blood boiling, melting his bones and flesh, turning his inside out, mashing his gut and brain into mud.

Castiel squirms violently on the floor, yelling in a mixed sound of high pitch and all kinds of human languages, switching from one dead tongue to another, like a computer frantically spitting out random error messages under a virus attack.

His eyes and mouth glow, light starts to flow but instead of leaving the body, the lights flicker, on and off, on and off, until they dim, like a broken light bulb trying its best to lighten up one last time before it blows. The light is captured back inside the body, the same way it can't escape a black hole. Not even any grace can escape the change.

Sam stands by him, watching. Bobby rushes back in at the sound. But none of the men can do anything or have any idea what is happening.

And that is only the beginning.

Castiel's body rises slowly into the air, his eyes half closed, looking half passed out, half dream walking. The lights in the room shake, sounds of thunder rolling from above the ceiling. In the shadow of the flickering lights, there spread the black wings, expanding from his shoulder blades, long and stretched, filling the whole room and beyond. The feathers shine black, the color of the night sky.

"Holy." Bobby gasps, taking a step back in awe. Sam stares.

And then the shape changes -- the dark crimson color of blood crawls from his back, reaching the root of the wings, flowing upwards, staining the feathers. Some feathers fall to the floor, others shrink and twist as if burned by fire. The bones holding the wings crack loudly and bend back, folding inward, twisting into distorted shapes. The wings no longer look like wings, more like bewildering branches with charred leaves barely attached in the winter.

The screaming and yelling of pain die away slowly, the pitch sinking from a human voice yelling to a wounded monster moaning. Low, pained growl.

As the wings fold and twist, they no longer hold the weight of the body, Castiel crashes back down, landing on all fours. Claws and scales grow from fingers and skin, bones shifting, face unrecognizable. A mixed shape of a hundred different wild animals but no name for what Castiel looks like now.

Bobby takes another step back, slowly reaching for his rifle. Sam reaches for his machete.

"Cas?" Bobby calls carefully, forcing his voice to stay as steady as he can manage.

The monster in front of them gnarls, can't tell if it's answering or threatening. He looks up slowly, eyes glassy and foggy. With the slightest shade of blue.

"Cas," Sam takes a breath. "Nod if you are still in there and can hear us."

They watch intensely. And Castiel whines, then, nods once, slowly.

Bobby breathes out heavily. "Good to know. Thank God you're not dead in that whole --" he waves a hand to vaguely refer to whatever happened just now, in place for a word he can never find. He clicks the safety back on.

"Yet." Sam reminds him.

"What?"

"Not dead, *yet*." Sam keeps his hunter's stance, hands still on the machete -- the very same one he carried into that vampire nest where Dean was beheaded. "He still needs to be dead to go to Purgatory, remember?"

Bobby swallows, falls to silence. After a beat: "And you wanna do the honor?"

"Unless you volunteer," Sam says, unbothered. "Don't see a third option here."

The worst thing is, he's right.

"And you're still on board with this 'getting killed to go to the horror land' plan?" Bobby checks with Cas one last time.

The monster that was -- is -- Cas nods unmistakably.

"This is absolutely the shittiest plan I've ever seen, and that includes two apocalypses." Bobby sighs deeply, resigned. He looks at Cas with genuine apology, "I'm sorry." Then to Sam, "Just, don't do it in here, will ya?"

Sam nods once, heading out. Castiel follows.

<br>

Bobby does not follow them outside, and he knows a bottle of whiskey is definitely not gonna be enough for tonight.

He doesn't need to see -- the squeaky sound of footsteps and claws heading to the opening in the junkyard is loud and clear in the midnight silence.

He closes his eyes.

There is the sound of metal cutting through flesh, and then something heavy falls to the ground.

One set of footsteps heads back, stepping on the ground that's now wetter and muddier than before.

Bobby shakes his head hard. "Cas, you stupid love-blind idjit."

<br>

### Chap. 3 Shadow

> 3 Act: Act 2, plot pinch 1 - middle point (moment of truth)

#### Act 1 Ext. Purgatory (Dean, Cas)

> (Dean POV)
>
> Cas falls to Purgatory, finds Dean. Dean doesn't recognize him, monster Cas can't talk, too weak to change back. The two support/survive in Purgatory for a while, Cas eats souls to grow stronger and can heal.

Dean lingers not far from the same opening that he last saw Cas for that brief moment. Sometimes by the stream, sometimes on the edge of the closest woods, but most of the time, just in the plain middle of the opening, without cover. It is a bad idea -- actually, the worst one possible -- to not move swiftly in a place like this.

Purgatory is the monster hunting ground, and staying put means food.

But Dean stays near there anyway. If the monsters come, he kills them. If the door opens again, he goes home. The logic simplifies down to the simplest, Dean distantly wonders if his brain will degenerate for lack of use, but soon he pushes that aside as well.

Leviathans still emerge once in a while, dropping in here and again like a recurring termite problem in an old house, though not as many as when Cas was here. Their faces shift between human appearance and the teethy monstrous face. Decapitation is still the best solution Dean can find. Not like there is any research book or anything else in Purgatory he can use anyway.

He would have lost the concept of time entirely if it weren't for his watch still ticking and running. But he doesn't know if it's a good thing or bad. Watching the hands tick one second, then another, slowly crawling forward, Dean thinks going lunatic is just a matter of time if he can't figure something out soon.

And he can't figure anything out.

The air never stirs again in the same way it did when the portal opened last time. There is no lit-up exit, no jail breaker or bail release.

Sometimes, Dean even considers sparing some monsters on his way, keeping one as a pet or something, to at least have something to look at and talk to -- hopefully one that's least ugly to look at -- just to keep himself sane for a little longer. He understands why Robinson Crusoe kept Friday on that island now.

And then, on a day he's long since lost count of which, he is attacked by a dozen vampires at once. Sarcastically, he knows them all. From that nasty nest that started this whole nightmare and sent him here.

He fights and kills and struggles and swings, taking down as many as he can, but a small part of his brain already knows how this will play out. That part of his mind floats above him, watching the scene unfold like a Deja Vu or a rewatched movie.

"I killed you once, don't mind doing that again," the big boss vamp grins, showing his ugly fangs, and knocks him down. Dean loses grip on the blade, pinned to the ground, all too similar to the first round.

Where do monsters go after they die in Purgatory? It's not the first time he's wondered, but this time he might actually go check it out himself.

And then, that vamp loses its head. Its headless body freezes, its grip on Dean's throat loosens, and then it falls stiffly down on top of him, not moving an inch anymore. Blood from the broken neck spills all over Dean's face.

Dean looks up.

A large monster holds the bitten-off vampire head between its teeth. The cutting edge where the neck should connect to the body drips blood between the creature's fangs. It sees him, hesitating, as if it can't decide whether to spit that bloody head out or swallow it.

It ends up swallowing it in a gulp. Light flares in its eyes as the head moves down its throat, and moments later, fades again. It still stares at Dean, not even blinking.

Dean jumps to his feet, blade ready, pointing at this new strange thing.

It's a huge creature, casting a long, stretched shadow across the ground as it moves, larger than most of the monsters around here, larger than most of the Leviathans even. Dean has never seen anything like this before, dead or alive, with furs and scales and fangs all at once, a hybrid of so many different things. Large, but broken. Confusing, but powerful. Troubling, but not ugly, not exactly. Just weird, and somehow it doesn't look like it belongs here, or anywhere. A creature that shouldn't exist even in lore. A creature that definitely doesn't look like naturally born.

Dean steps back slowly as the monster moves toward him in small steps, both of them prudent. It must be stronger than him, way stronger. Judging by how it bit off that vampire's head, it could probably kill Dean in a blink without breaking a sweat. Then why is it just looking at him, doing nothing?

Its fangs jut behind its closed mouth, still glinting with fresh blood. On its back, black twisted parts stick out, looking more like broken horns than wings.

Dean frowns at this thing, hunter's instinct kicking in, pulling and dragging him in two different directions. The blade in his hand is still dripping blood from the vampires he killed minutes ago, the instinct of continuing the action he's grown increasingly familiar with washes over him. It might be strong, but Dean is fast. If he's lucky, he might get a chance to its weak spot if it has any -- with such a twisted clumsy body and weird biological structure, he bets it can't move as fast as he can.

But then, there is something else in it that makes him pause. Looking. Observing. Asking questions first and shooting second. Something about this monster -- maybe it's the black wing-like structure on its back, maybe it's the slightly tan hide and dim blue front, or just the way it approaches him, the way it bit off the head of the vamp that almost killed him again -- somehow, Dean think it's not going to hurt him. Somehow, it can be trusted. He thinks he must've already lost his damn mind to think that for a whole new level of freak.

Dean circles it, checking out its side, its back, its shape. It stops moving, standing still, letting him look, allowing him move behind it where it can't see, purring and moaning in a low grave sound. Not menacing, more like a sad, quiet plea. More trusting than anything else he's met in here or out there. He could easily stab it in the back right now if he wanted. Dean silently shifts the angle of his fingers on the blade, gripping it tighter, but not pointing at the thing. Not yet anyway, not unless he has a reason to.

Dean notices it's wounded, badly. Not fatal, probably, but surely hurt like hell. There are teeth-shaped wounds on its legs bleeding black and a round bullet-shaped hole on its shoulder bleeding crimson red. When it moves, its left paw lands shallower than the rest, he'd guess there are cuts there too.

The vampire part of him is still functioning. The metallic smell of blood leaking from the creature is too strong, there is no way of ignoring. Dean sniffs. The most confusing part is, the blood doesn't smell right. Human blood smells fragrant, vampire blood dull and dead, demon blood sour, Leviathans bitter. But this thing, it's like a drug store, with all kinds of bad smells mixed together, flowing in its veins, masking whatever used to be there.

"What are you?" Dean can't help asking.

The monster answers him in a low set of guttural mumbling, presumably telling him things about itself but he hasn't the faintest idea of monster language.

"Alright, chill, pal," Dean says, walking two more steps closer to it, cautiously.

It's about within its attack range now, if it desires. Dean holds eye contact, waiting for a killer blow, weighing whether the blade should target to its paw or the head first if that happens.

But nothing happens. It holds the stare, looking back, looking straight. It barely blinks.

The feeling is strangely familiar.

Dean thinks he even sees a familiar shade of blue. He must be hallucinating now. Or wishful thinking, whatever that means.

"Okay, this is just getting weird," Dean mutters, lowering the blade, shaking his head. "You just remind me of my best friend."

The creature purrs louder, the sound strained and urgent.

Dean raises his eyebrows. Then he tells it, "No, uh-uh, no way, I'm not gonna name you 'Cas' just 'cause you want me to. What do you think my angel buddy would feel if he knew?"

He considers "Thursday" as a name for the briefest moment.

He still ends up naming the creature "Cas".

Cas might just find it hilarious and then have that little amused smile of his, it would be nice to see him smile. Dean reasons with himself, patting the creature gently on the back where the scales cover. It feels cold and sticky.

Dean pulls his hand back.

#### Act 2 Ext. Purgatory (Cas, Dean)

> (monster Cas's POV)
>
> monster Cas pov, can see the world in floating colors, only shapes of colors, no thoughts, no words, light and dark, other monster souls are lights that he can eat, in the center, there is the brightest light, the brightest soul. He approaches, gets too attracted but intimated by the intensity and heat, like wild animal circling camper's bonfire, ghosting at the edge of the shadow, tempted but feared. The more souls he eats, the vision gets clearer, he recognizes Dean. But it only makes him hesitant more, he looks at his claws, making sure Dean doesn't see him. Only go into his view when seeing he's in danger and he has to. self-aware

The world is a pool of shapes and colors, floating and swimming, emerging and diverging. Some shapes and colors move closer, some farther. Some red and their approach burns, some black and tearing and cold, the others vague and grey, passing by without extra sensation.

There is no thought, no words. Light or dark, colored or bleak. That's all there is.

It takes a while to realize the small blinking lights are edible, and those feel good -- making the colors look brighter and shapes sharper. Almost like the view is getting clearer, but still the same forms.

It takes a longer while to realize those lights are souls, and absorbing them can bring strength back, making wounds heal -- even just slightly.

Castiel wanders in the land, fumbling, searching. Not knowing where he is, not knowing where he's heading. Not knowing what he himself is, most of the time. Just wandering, drifting. Afloat like a duckweed.

He opens his mouth, growls echoing as vocal cords vibrate. He sinks teeth in, blood seeping out from the things in his bite, bodies twitching, then not moving. The light that rested inside of them shifts and moves along with the blood, moving into him. He swallows them, then moves away.

The creatures and monsters crowd around this place like rabbits in summer prairie. Led by instincts, he hunts and eats and moves, chasing one sparkling light to another, knowing all of them are nothing more than food and sources of strength.

And then he sees it. In the center of the opening, the brightest light shades everything else, dulling all the other creatures. The light of the soul that is like a beacon on the sea, the North Star in a starry sky, the crackling burning fire in the polar night, the Sun in the dark Space. So bright that its illumination and heat almost scorch him from this distance.

But he steps toward it. He can't stop staring at it, and he can't stop himself from moving toward it. The bright, the light, the heat, the beacon. The center of the universe is there. The brightest soul that he's ever seen.

Even without a clear view, even without a clear mind with any of the memory and knowledge he doesn't know he has, he would know this is what he's looking for -- even if he doesn't remember what it is, or what he himself is.

He approaches it, the attraction uncontrollable, but also unavoidably intimidating. The intensity and the heat, the light itself, the soul that is so strong, it appeals to him and terrifies him in the same way wild animals are drawn to and frightened by a camper's bonfire.

Castiel circles the light, hiding in the woods, letting the shadows cover his trace. Tempted, but intimidated. Staying just close enough to see it, but not close enough to be seen.

Time passes by relentlessly, he hunts and eats and devours and waits. The power from the souls of small creatures and monsters accumulates, the vision gets clearer. So does the mind.

Name is the first thing coming back, language the second.

"Dean." He can see through the shape now, the light of his soul still blinding. The man's name emerges in his beast's mind. Castiel almost makes a long gnarl, but he restrains himself -- Dean might hear him, and then he wouldn't know what to do.

Looking down, he sees his claws on the dusty ground, stained with dirt and blood. In the reflection of the stream, he sees his own face and he pulls back immediately, not wanting to see the hideous figure ever again.

He makes sure Dean doesn't either.

The woods provide enough cover, even for his size. He wanders far enough to hunt and grow strength, but not too far to lose Dean's bright lighted soul out of view -- not that it's possible. In the end, how can one lose sight of the Sun in the sky?

But then, come the attackers. The vampires are edging closer and crowding around Dean. There are too many of them. The bright light of the soul starts getting overshadowed, the threat of fangs and paws pressing on the body's neck. The danger is too strong to fend off, and worst of all, the light itself is willingly going out.

Castiel can't have it. For all his existence, this is the thing he cannot allow to happen, whatever the cost.

So there is the exposure, and there is the attacking and biting and eating just out of instinct.

The metallic bloody smell assails his nostrils. The vampire's head is between his teeth, then down his throat. It is only then does Castiel realizes this is the time when Dean would raise the blade and bury it in his body.

He freezes, eyes wide.

His vision clears, the face in front of him sharpens. Dean. It's really Dean. As human as he can be, the face, the body, every inch of his existence so achingly familiar. And his blade high and ready.

"Dean," he calls his name, desperate. The only sound rolling out of his throat is the monster's roar.

Castiel thinks this is the end of it. The end of him, anyway. With all his efforts, at least the very last thing -- the very last person -- in his view is Dean. He shouldn't complain too much. He probably deserves it anyway.

He looks into the man's eyes, really looks. Like the mermaid stripped of voice, the eyes and looks are all he has. He sees the familiar amber green in the man's eyes, the exhaustion, the anger, the confusion. And something else.

Castiel pleads silently: "Please see me, Dean."

The blade is lowered.

Dean is always so full of surprise.

### Chap. 4 Bloody

#### Act 1 Ext./Int. Purgatory (Dean, Cas)

> (Dean POV)
>
> action sequence, kill other monsters together, Cas eats them, grow visibly stronger the more he eats, wounds healing, shape reverting
>
> Dean helps feeding him, making him better

(**Warning words** before the part: Mentions of passive suicidal ideation)

<br>

Dean barely sleeps. In a place like this, he can't even blink his eyes too slowly, let alone close them. He doesn't know how the body functions in this place, whether it really needs sleep or food or any of the usual human crap his brain is still used to as a living human, but now he's neither living nor human.

But Cas nudges him to rest -- at least he thinks that's what it means.

When his watch points to night, Cas leads them to a spot between the woods. The trunk looks decent as a resting place. Cas settles by it, getting down on its belly, looking at him.

Dean checks the trunk -- nothing special -- then looks at Cas, amused. "What? You wanna take a nap?"

The monster shakes its head, then nudges his side slightly, almost pushing him to the ground.

"Alright, alright, I get it." Dean sits down beside the trunk, curling up by the root, resting his head on his arms. "You happy?"

The creature hums a low purring sound, not too different from a cat's satisfied rumble after a full meal. Dean chuckles, propping his head up slightly, running right into the pair of eyes that are staring at him.

"Dude, stop watching a guy sleep like that!" he complains, and that sense of familiarity rises again. He flutters, "But, uh, wake me up if anything happens, alright?"

He gets another low mumble of confirmation. Dean thinks his monster language is improving.

He gets a few hours of closed eyes.

The sky still looks the same when he wakes. Cas doesn't seem to have moved an inch. Somehow he does feel better -- his body not so tense, his mind beginning to get back online.

Dean sits up slowly, glancing at the creature he named Cas from the corner of his eyes. That thing is doing the same, as if it took his comment about "don't stare" seriously.

"Hey," Dean says. It meets his eyes immediately. Dean can't help feeling the tips of his lips lifting slightly -- a facsimile of a smile that has never been there since he came downstairs.

"Thanks for watching out for me," he tells it. The monster purrs something that definitely means "don't mention it."

<br>

Life improves with Cas hanging around -- though there is never a life to begin with in a place like this. But still, each second passes a little faster and more tolerable than before, so is each minute. At least that is how Dean feels.

The best part is, at least he has someone -- something -- to talk with. Not like this Cas would really answer back, but from the way it looks at him, the way the lights shift in its starry eyes, Dean thinks it understands. If it could speak human, it would just talk.

And sometimes, he thinks he can understand its purrs and mumbles and low growls from deep in its throat. The unsaid tongues without words.

"Sometimes I really think about just lying down, y'know? I'm so tired. Not exactly giving up, but just not fighting the fate so hard anymore. I mean, look at us, what's the point of all this? I'm a vampire and you're... some monster, and we are in Purgatory. If whatever shitty Destiny wants me to end up here, fine, I guess. Why bother going anywhere else?" Once, Dean tells it.

They just finished a fight. It was a pack of werewolves, the leading one was a pureblood, violent and unbelievably strong, even Cas had to struggle with it for several brutal rounds before biting into its neck and ending it for good. Dean was left aside handling a handful on his own. They are both panting and bleeding, exhausted.

Cas growls. Dean drops his gaze to the ground, wondering aloud in his own head. "I just can't see any way of getting out. And even if we do, then what? I don't even know how much time has passed here, or on Earth, if time even passes the same. Forty years in Hell was four months on Earth, what if a month here is a hundred years on Earth? Sam could be long gone, and Cas... I don't even know where Cas is or how his war is and everything... Everything might already be too late. God, I didn't even get time to tell them anything."

Dean whimpers. The monster he named Cas moves closer, lowering itself, leaning its massive body against his side. The twisted charred bones on its back twitch, looking like an attempt to reach out, to touch him.

Dean shakes his head. "You're not even real Cas, I don't know why I keep calling you that, I don't even know why I didn't just kill you like I killed all the other monsters." He laughs once, dry. "I must be losing my mind. Sometimes maybe I was even hoping if I'm ended by some monster here -- maybe could even be you -- then I could stop thinking about all this. Things could finally end for good. Talk about peace, eh?"

The creature's eyes meet his, larger and more glaring than ever, bluer and sadder than ever, getting watery on the edges even. It makes a sound from deep in its chest, low and thick and wet, like sobbing.

Dean swallows. He reaches out, touching its side, pressing his head against its scales to let the cool sensation seep through his forehead. He sighs, taking a long breath. "Sorry." Not sure if it's to make the creature or himself feel better.

He wipes his face with the back of his hand, then does the same for the monster. The tears slipping down its cheek wet his fingers. "Guess it's not for nothing, at least there's still you -- whatever you are -- still wanting me to keep kicking around. Right, buddy?"

He pats its shoulder twice, gentle, just a little higher than the shoulder blade where the wing stretches out -- he's starting to figure out where it's safe to touch that wouldn't make a pained sound from the creature.

"Let's keep rolling then, you and me, Thelma and Louise, monster version. Who knows, maybe one day we'll reach the cliff and maybe the jump is the way out."

They keep moving.

<br>

Cas is healing. Dean can't help noticing.

Every time it swallows a monster's head or heart, its eyes light up a little, and after that, some wounds and cuts begin to close -- even just a little bit. After a while, the gash on its leg becomes only a shallow scar, which goes away completely with the death of a pack of djinns.

"Why don't we go hunt some bigger things? Bet they'll do you real nice and comfy." Wiping the blood from his blade with his sleeve, Dean considers aloud.

Cas narrows its eyes, questioning.

Dean goes, "Eating makes a man stronger, I get that. Souls or lives or whatever it is, you need them, don't you? I mean, I don't have many things on my calendar this time of year, and we mostly just wait for attacks before getting to them. I was thinking, you obviously could get better a lot faster if you ate more, why don't we raid some monster nests and get them for you? Surely dine-in tastes better than delivery?"

Cas hesitates, not looking very fond of the idea.

Dean studies it -- its eyes or whatever way it chooses to express itself lately, the way its head tilts or its paw shifts. "You get what I'm saying?"

Cas nods once, but the muscle on its face tightens, the closest thing to a human frown.

"Why? You don't like it?"

Cas glances off into the distance, toward where some other monsters are howling, then looks back at Dean, eyes flowing with concern.

"You're worried about me." The realization clicks, and Dean huffs a laugh, twisting his wrist to show off how he can juggle the blade to kill whatever stands in their way.

He pats the monster on the shoulder. "Don't be, I'm a damn good hunter, in case you didn't already know. That's my job -- was -- anyway. Killing monsters, hunting things, until it ended up ugly like this. 'Sides, I've got you at my back, don't I?"

Dean starts moving toward where the howling is the loudest.

Cas follows him closely behind.

<br>

They hit a shapeshifter nest. The nasty things are still the trickiest even in Purgatory -- changing into people he knows. The family of shifters turns into his own family -- Sam, Cas, Bobby, Jess, Mom, Dad, even himself, in a clean flannel. A big happy family reunion -- Purgatory version.

"Hate the shifters," Dean mutters under his breath, chopping the closest one's head off, which happens to be wearing his own face.

Cas bites off the shifter-Sam and shifter-Cas's heads.

Soon enough, they take down all the rest before the creatures even get a chance to change again or run away.

"We make quite a good team, eh?" Dean glances around. The two of them are the only things left standing in the nest.

Cas wanders deeper into the nest, reaching for good bites before moving back toward the exit.

"Buddy, think you left one behind," Dean calls, kicking the shifter-himself's head toward Cas. Not sure if this is the very same shifter he managed to kill years ago in St. Louis. If it is, then Fate is definitely a bitch that loves joking around and this bastard definitely had an obsession in using his face.

Cas moves towards it, reluctant.

Dean watches it. "What's the matter? Don't have the heart to take a snack 'cause it's got my pretty face?" Cas gives him a look. Dean chuckles. "You do know it's not me, right? I'm cool with you eating it -- me -- whatever. So what's your problem? Too shy to eat with an audience?"

Cas makes a sound that's awful lot like a complaint to Dean's ears, but finally absorbs the last shifter head. Dean watches the blue white lights fill its eyes then dim gradually. The wing bone on its back spreads a small angle from its usual twisted fold. Some scales drop off, revealing smooth skin underneath. The nails on its paws shrink by an inch or two.

Dean grins. "See? Told ya. Feel good, right?"

Cas murmurs something, might be "Thank you." Even that voice sounds lighter and brighter, less monstrous than minutes ago, less incomprehensible to the extent Dean can guess the meaning from the syllables.

"You're actually kinda adorable. Can't believe I just said that. Come on, we might have enough time to find you a second dinner before we head back."

Things are looking good.

<br>

#### Act 2 Ext./Int. Purgatory (Dean, Cas)

> 3 Act: Act 2, middle point (moment of truth, fake ending)
>
> (Dean POV)
>
> Leviathans attack them, Dean knows now the monster accompany him all this time is really Cas. Cas is almost dead under Leviathan's attack, Dean has to hunt and feed him souls to save him and help him recover (kiss him in his monster form).

> Cas almost hurts Dean the moment he wakes up, guilty when realizing it's Dean, "way to say thank you", heal him, both recovered/healed

(**Warning words** before the part: Gross description of eating weird things, including monster body parts. Very minor dubious consent.)

<br>

Things are never good or easy or anywhere remotely like that in their whole lives. Dean should know.

Cas is getting better, that's for sure. The wounds healing, the monstrous parts molting. The bones on its back stretch from the folded position, finally starting to look like wing bones, though there are still very few feathers left. Paws and fur and scales shrinking and falling away.

Dean has a hunch that this monster wasn't a monster to start with, but a hunch is just a hunch, he can't know for sure. Some theories have crossed his mind, sure, but without knowing for certain, without being able to *talk* to the creature, what he knows is still a big pile of jack.

All he can do is scratch his brain out wondering. And continue doing what he and the creature have been doing for god knows how long -- killing, and more killing, the endless killing and hunting. Story of his life.

And then, the Leviathans come back. They were never really gone, but now they are clearly back in the game, back with their dedicated appetite for them. And they come at the worst time.

Cas is going through another round of changing. It's been happening more and more often lately. And the process is taking longer and more painful -- judging by its repressed moans and groans. All the scales on the left side of its body peel off, showing naked fresh skin not too different from human skin -- tender, and vulnerable. Dean isn't even sure if it's a good thing or bad. Certainly it's the worst timing when attacks are coming.

Cas moans lowly with fear. They're surrounded.

The way those Leviathans approach and circle them, Dean has a vague impression they have the same amount of interest just last time Castiel was here. The only times they've shown such dedicated hunger on one thing.

"Back off!" he yells, tightening his grip on the blade, stepping back until his back is pressed to the familiar body warmth. "It's just called Cas, not even the real Cas!"

The leading Leviathan widens its ugly mouth and laughs, the sound so shrill that distant howling from other monsters silenced in terror. "You know nothing," it mocks, gloating. "We can smell the angel from across the land. Don't know what he did to himself, but now he's back to the delicious dinner flavor."

Dean's heart sinks. He glances at *Cas* in shock, meeting its -- his -- equally heartbroken eyes. Cas isn't exactly back to a form Dean can fully recognize him with confidence yet, but somehow, deep down, he thinks he already knew it's true, he just hasn't allowed himself to believe it.

He pushes the sick feeling down, for now. The Leviathans are still here.

"It doesn't matter." Dean straightens his face, raising the blade. The body closest to him still radiates heat in this cold bleak place, a familiar source of comfort.

Dean pulls the corner of his lips into a ghost of a smile. "Whatever he is, you are still gonna die. All of you."

The wave of attacks slams into them without warning. The lead Leviathan is fierce and enormous -- when it opens its mouth, there are layers upon layers of teeth, all long and sharp like blades, a cave of teeth.

Dean swings his bone blade at it, it doesn't dodge, and the blade does little. Black liquid leaks out at the contact, the blade sinks into a body that is definitely not flesh and blood. He gets thrown out of the way, his head knocking onto a rock in the ground, falling unconscious.

The last thing he hears before the black curtain draws in front of his eyes is Cas's pained yell that sounds nothing other than his own name.

Then the blinding light of a grace explosion and the darkness fall on him at the same time.

<br>

His head hurt like son of a bitch.

Dean curses as the sensation drags him back into his body, knowing for sure if the pain is still here, he isn't going anywhere else, therefore definitely isn't dead in the monster afterlife, yet.

"Cas." His mind kicks back online, that's the first word that pops in. He snaps open his eyes.

He is safe and sound, comfortable even, resting close to a source of warmth and something soft. The creature -- Cas, the real Cas, not just the name -- keeps him close, nestling him under itself -- himself.

Dean has to keep reminding himself the thing is a he, it's Cas, he's Cas.

"God, it's so messed up." He frowns tight, dragging himself to his feet, staggering. The back of his head is still throbbing. He tries to ignore it. A painkiller would be heaven right this moment.

"Hey, buddy." He reaches a hand toward Cas, touching his back, shaking him gently. Only to feel a handful of stickiness. Castiel's eyes are shut tight, not moving an inch.

Dean's stomach knots, sinking straight to the bottom. "No, no, no. Cas! Cas!" His palm comes back full of blood, fresh and iron sweet, tempting his own vamp fangs sticking out on instinct.

Dean swallows hard, holding his breath just in case he can't restrain himself. His throat screams in thirst, he forces it down.

It is only then does he see the new wounds on Cas's body. The new tender skin that is no longer covered by scales is torn wide open, his internal organs are exposed to the air, mixed with sluggishly flowing light. His grace hovers on the threshold, moving in and out. The newly spread wing bones on his back are snapped broken, almost twisted in half, looking worse even than before, hanging pitifully from the second joint. Blood trickles from the corner of his mouth.

Dean's hands are shaking, panic rising. He reaches for breath under Cas's nose, tests for a pulse on his throat. The tiniest flow of air brushes against his skin, the pulse is so faint that he almost misses it. But it's still there. Cas is hanging on by a thread. He hasn't lost him, not yet.

Dean breathes out, stepping back, pacing. "Okay. Okay. Not too late, not bad. Hang in there, buddy. What do I do? What do I do?"

He glances around. The Leviathans that were there before are all pieces and tears like exploded balloons now, but the black slime is still moving, one pile slithering toward another, trying to glue themselves back together.

Dean picks a dip up on the tip of his blade, inspecting it. "This is just disgusting." He looks back at Cas. "What do you think, this thing is edible or not? Would it make you better?"

Cas doesn't stir the slightest for any answer.

Dean has to answer it for himself. "Yeah, I agree, can't be too picky right now, am I right?"

He scoops a pile of the black goo into his palm, walking back to Cas, and touches it to his lips. "Open up, Cas. Dinner's ready."

Cas's mouth is closed tight, not any gap he can slide the "food" through.

Dean stares at him, frowning, desperate. "God, why does everything have to be so difficult?"

Heart pounding, glancing around, there is nothing around in visible distance, certainly no *one* around would see them.

Dean breathes out, looking at Cas's closed eyes. "Sorry, no other way. Don't say I took advantage of you when you were out, alright? Desperate times."

He takes the goo into his own mouth, trying his best to block out the disgusting slimy texture and bitter rot taste. Kneeling down so he's at the same height as Cas's mouth where his monster body lies, Dean presses their lips together, pushing the food through.

Cas's lips are dry and frustose, rough like tree bark, tasting like copper and iron with a lingering note of fragrant sweetness from blood. But at least it's opening now under the pressure, the remains of Leviathan slide in.

Dean watches his throat swallow, backing from his position, waiting.

Nothing big happens. No light show. But Cas's breath evens.

"Guess it's doing something then." Dean almost grins, exhaling in relief.

He licks his own lips, not realizing he's swallowing the residual taste of sweetness. When he does, he freezes. The taste is from the blood he touched accidentally on Cas's lips, Cas's blood, the sweet taste of angel blood. No wonder the Leviathans were gathering to him like flies to a feast.

The vampire part of instinct starts fighting for control in his brain, all he can taste and smell now is that specific exotic sweetness. He can hear the blood flowing through Cas's veins now, slowly, faintly, as his heartbeat is so weak -- something he's been trying to block out whenever the two of them are close.

Cas is dying and he's losing it. Dean clenches his fists and knocks them to his own skull, desperately trying to clear the hunger from his brain.

"Not now!" he growls at himself. "I'll kill you before you ever even think about draining him!"

He throws himself farther away, taking in another repulsive clump of Leviathans' sludge, and leaving them on his tongue, hoping in vain that the disgusting bitter taste could be vile enough to choke down the throbbing hunger and desire. His fangs refuse to shrink back into his gums.

His steps are shaky, hands trembling, but he manages to stagger back to Cas, kneeling down again like the first time. Forcing his brain to think of only two things in the world that matter: "Cas is dying" and "Cas needs me."

He presses his lips onto Cas's, feeding him the source of strength he undoubtedly needs, then pulls away with a head spinning so bad he can't even tell the direction.

But it's working. He can hear it now, Cas's heartbeat growing stronger, blood flowing faster in his veins. Which is making the situation increasingly difficult for him, but it's good. It's good. Cas is getting better.

So he does it again.

And again.

<br>

The burning thirst in his throat is like lava boiling. Dean thinks the vampire fever in him might literally burst into flames and burn him alive from the inside out with sheer desire. His entire vision is turning red, with the smear of blood on Cas's lips the cherry on the cake.

Dean thinks he could never hate himself more than he does now.

He has to bite on his own wrist to ease the burning in his throat for a moment before continuing.

He manages to continue feeding Cas without totally losing control. He doesn't know how much longer he can keep it up, but he can't stop.

Cas's wounds are visibly healing. The bones are growing back.

It takes ages, but they're getting there. The moves are getting familiar, turning into muscle memory.

They finished off the remains of the blasted Leviathans. Dean changes his strategies. He ventures farther, hunting more creatures and monsters on his own. Be it vampires or werewolves or wendigos or whatever they are, he just gulps them down, feeling the raw energy of their existence filling his inside, then goes back to the nest he manages to make out of a natural shelter and take Cas to, and feeds him mouth-to-mouth. Life-force energy flows with all body parts and blood is the best medium -- he'll have to write that down in his hunting journal somewhere.

Dean doesn't dare to go too far away or leave Cas alone unconscious for too long, so the trips are cut short and trivial. It's tiring, but Dean manages it.

The biggest question is why Cas is still not waking up.

"Used up all your mojo stock for me again, didn't you?" Once, after making sure the flowing light of souls and energies has all gone through into Cas's mouth, Dean steps back, sitting down for some rest for himself, regarding Cas's shape.

"Don't know how much you had to hunt and eat to get to this state, just to throw it all away and start from ground zero again." Dean frowns at him, wondering aloud. "Cas, why do you keep doing this?"

His best friend just has his eyes closed, quiet as always, not showing a sign that he hears him.

Dean has helped clean him up, wiped his face and body carefully without making the wounded parts worse. And with the feeds, he does look a lot better.

Dean checks him every now and then, noticing the small improvements with every feed. The scales are gone gradually, so are the paws. The wings take the longest time, the feathers seem to have to grow back one at a time, like spring blossoms and buds, but they all look good, shiny black and healthy. Cas's face is back to recognizable too, the same face he's been seeing a little more than two years now plus however many days he's been in here, Dean has no idea how much he misses him.

"Cas."

Sometimes he calls his name. Other times he prays.

The Leviathans said he is back to angel now, more or less, isn't he? So with some luck, maybe he can hear his prayers better than his words? Dean has to give it a shot.

*Cas, man, please, hear me. Wake up for me.*

Dean thinks hard, more pleading than praying, but he doesn't really care. Anything to make things right again.

Putting the words in his head seems to be easier than making them out of his tongue.

*I need you, buddy, you hear me? I need you breathing and kicking and alive, and we'll figure out the rest together. Just, come back to me. Cas, please.*

Castiel's face remains stoic, calm even, as if he's just deep in sleep.

Dean stares at him, having no clue what to do. Cas looks more human than ever -- he can be distant and all-powerful when he shows up as an angel, he can be fearsome and terrifying as a monster, but now he just looks like a human, plus some wings. Chest rising and falling, everything seems to be normal, just not waking up.

Dean presses the heels of his palms into his eyes, feeling them hot and wet. Hopeless.

Eyes closed, he leans in, kissing the chapped lips, gentle. No soul to feed this time, just the touch.

He doesn't even know why he does that, his own body pulls him forward, leading the motion, and it gives him comfort. And hope. As if saying if he can still do this, then there is still a way out, a way forward. His heartbeat eases just as his lips caress Cas's.

That is when he feels the lips shift. There is a startled gasp, an immediate pull away, and a dumb punch in the face.

Dean jumps back, looking up.

Cas is awake, pulled away from where he'd been lying, back pressed to the wall of the place Dean calls "home base" these days. Eyes panicked and shaky. Wings hidden away.

Dean doesn't know what that feeling in his gut is -- is that joy or hurt, or both, maybe.

"Cas, Cas, it's me, it's okay." He rushes, holding out a hand like when he needs to soothe a startled animal. "You're safe, it's just me."

The blue eyes land on him, recognition flickers. "Dean." He breathes out. The voice is hoarse from lack of use, but it's human words. Castiel looks around the place, looks down on himself, inspecting his fingers and behind his back, then looks Dean up and down. Eyes shining with disbelief.

Dean manages a smile. "Yeah, buddy. It's me. Welcome back."

Cas adjusts his posture and sits straighter, his fingers touching his own lips, slow, as if reliving that lingering aftertaste. Dean feels a blush rising up his cheek in the same place where he's been punched. He rubs the place, trying in vain to hide it.

"What was that?" Cas looks at him again, gaze following his fingers.

"Nothing." Dean realizes he answered too quick, thinking back. "Just, you know, testing out a theory, and apparently it worked. So now we can just --"

"What theory?"

"You know, just the fairy tales."

Cas raises an eyebrow in question. Dean finds his throat tight.

He sighs. "Sleeping beauty, Princess, everyone knows the story, true love's kiss breaks all curses --" Cas opens his mouth, Dean barrels on, "-- which is probably just some coincidence! Can we just leave it like that?"

Cas closes his mouth. His eyes drop. "Yes, we can just leave it like that." Then, "I'm sorry."

"For what?"

Cas looks up, guilt written all over his face. "Everything."

"Well, if you mean punching me in the face for waking you up, there're indeed better ways to say thank you." Dean swallows down the feeling that is rising in his gut seeing the way Cas's eyes look, but he can't parse any of the meanings.

"Not just that." Cas hesitates, but still, reaching out a hand with two fingers pointed out, aiming for his cheek that is slightly getting swollen from the punch. "May I?"

Dean holds his gaze, lowering his own restless hands, and nods once.

The heated sensation on his cheek fades, so do all the other small aches and wounds all over his body he hadn't really noticed. Even his shirts and jeans get cleaned up and smoothed down like coming fresh out of washing and ironing.

Looking back into the angel's briefly brightened up eyes, Dean gives him another small smile. "Thanks Cas, good to have you back."

Castiel swallows, not returning the smile. "There is something I have to tell you."

#### Act 1 Ext./Int. Purgatory (Dean, Cas)

"You what?!" Dean stares at him like the angel transformed into a creature again.

"I was working with Crowley looking for Purgatory --" Castiel repeats dutifully.

"Yes, I heard you the first time, dumbass, I'm asking why the hell would you do that!" Dean snaps. "Crowley, really?"

"There was no other way," Castiel answers bluntly. The dumbass probably still thinks that remains the best option. Dean really wants to punch him just to knock some sense into him.

"Dude, there is always a better option than making a deal with a demon! Especially Crowley!" Dean glares at him.

"Like what, for instance?" Castiel meets his eyes.

"Like me! For instance!" Dean can't help raising his voice. "Did it occur to you that you can always come to me for help, Cas? That we don't have to carry every damn thing on our shoulders, because we have each other?" His voice falters at the end, dipping into sadness. Dean doesn't want to think about why.

Castiel swallows, and doesn't answer immediately. Dean almost thinks he'd never hear an answer and he wouldn't know what to do with the knot in his gut, when Cas answers, "Yes." Dean doesn't know why he's surprised.

"Yes, Dean, of course I do," Cas tells him, his face lined in remorse. "That was the first thing I did when I realized there was going to be a civil war in Heaven. I was at your doorstep. But you couldn't see me then."

"Then why didn't you knock?"

"How could I? After everything we'd been through," Cas tightens his jaw, "After Hell and two Apocalypses, you finally had a family, a woman who loved you and a kid who admired you, how could I take that away from you?"

Dean swallows hard. "It doesn't matter," he finally manages to say. "That's not the life I belong to anyway."

Cas's eyes sadden. "I can see that. Please know it was never my intention."

Dean has to turn away, walking to the opening of their base to even his breath for a moment. Then, "Well, next time you have a problem, you go straight to me. No lies, no partial truths. You tell me everything you know, and we handle the problem together. You hear me, Cas?"

Castiel watches his back, nodding slowly and solemnly. "Yes, Dean."

Dean glances back over his shoulder. "Great, now I feel like some douchbag commander giving orders and you're just like a good little soldier knowing one line for your whole life: 'Yes, sir.'"

Cas blinks blankly. "Would you prefer I say no?"

Dean sighs, a small chuckle escaping. "It's a joke, never mind. What now?"

Cas steps beside him, to the threshold of their makeshift shelter -- a cave formed by natural stone and some extra tree trunks barring as a crude door. Together, they look out into the open air and sky of Purgatory. It looks exactly the same no matter how many times they watch.

"Now we leave this place and go back to Earth," Cas says.

Dean eyes him, "We can do that?"

"Yes," Cas says briefly, his gaze still on the farthest distance they can reach. The woods are relatively quiet at this hour, but silence doesn't mean safe. There is no safe anywhere in Purgatory, there's only busy hours and slow hours.

"And the punchline is?" Dean knows better than to trust there is any free lunch anywhere ever.

Castiel hesitates.

Dean bites, "What did we just agree on, Cas?"

Cas shifts his feet, "I need to absorb enough souls -- maybe even all of them -- to have enough power to open a portal."

Dean squints, "Which makes it exactly the same plan you had initially to fight with Raphael."

Cas nods.

"Let me guess, the risk is you might not survive this, is that it?" Dean can almost see the card Destiny always loves to play on them.

"Possibly," Cas nods again without hesitation. "But we don't know for sure. No one has tried anything like this before."

"So we're like the first ones to try the crabs," Dean mutters, "Could be good delicious food, could be poisoned to death."

Cas hums quietly in agreement, then, "There is no other way."

"You knew it even before you came down here, didn't you?" Dean realizes, turning toward Cas fully, "You knew you'd have to do this and you might not survive it."

"Yes," Cas answers easily. "To save you, that's a risk I'm willing to take."

"Why?" Dean asks bluntly.

"Why?" Cas echoes, like he's genuinely confused why that's a question even needs to be asked.

"Yes, I have to ask, why?" Dean has to push down something bubbling in his own gut again that he doesn't want to touch, just following the conversation that is already out there. His eyes slide down from Cas's eyes to his lips, his mind remembers the taste of his lips, but he forces his eyes to move back to the blue eyes. Dean wets his own dry lips unconsciously.

Cas's gaze locks onto Dean's, almost piercing deep inside. Then he averts his eyes.

"I still see myself as the Winchesters' guardian angel," Castiel states with an even voice, "I need to take care of the humans in my charge -- you and your brother."

"That's it?" Dean prompts, his voice dropping quieter. The bubbles and the knots in the gut are getting worse, he pours some icy water over them and boxes them away.

"Yes," Cas says. Not meeting his eyes.

Dean's Adam's apple bobs up and down once, his eyes lingering on the angel standing straight next to him for one long minute.

"If this is gonna be the last time I see you," Dean says slowly, swallowing hard, "I want you to hear this, Cas: Thank you, I mean really, thank you, for everything you've done for us. For me, especially. I just realized I've never really said that, I can't believe I never did. And I'm sorry for pulling you into all kinds of shitholes, you don't deserve that. And for Christ's sake, you're so much more than just our guardian angel, you're... you're my best friend, you're family. You have to know that, Cas."

Castiel looks at him with a small sincere smile. "Thank you, Dean," he says formally. "It's an honor to know you."

And that, is the breaking point for Dean.

"Fuck," he curses, not caring about anything anymore. Dean reaches out and hauls Cas forward by the collar, pulling him over, dragging him into a tight hug with his lips on the angel's. The lips are as dry and chapped as the last time he remembered, but warmer and more alive. His teeth almost bump into Cas's lips, with his fangs scraping the inner of his own lips. Dean restrains himself from using tongue and teeth. It's still a messy one.

Cas stills for a brief moment. His body moves before his eyes calming down from the wild startle. His arms wrap around Dean's back, pushing a reassuring weight on him, pressing their bodies together with the warmth of the chests radiating through the touch. His lips following Dean's motion, he returns the kiss as Dean leads.

Dean pants when he pulls back just an inch, arms still wrapped around the back of Cas's head, his black hair more ruffled than before. Dean rests his head against Cas's shoulder, their cheeks brushing.

"That's how much I don't want you to die, you get that?" Dean murmurs into Cas's ear, eyes closed. "If there's any chance of living, any at all, don't die." He hears his tone pleading, and he leaves it be.

"Okay," Cas answers quietly, his voice passing through the vibration of his chest and Dean can feel it right where his heart pounds.

"Okay." Dean pats his back one last time and lets him go. He wipes the corners of his eyes.

"Alright then. Let's juice you up and blow a hole in this godforsaken place."

<br>

#### Act 2 Ext. Purgatory (Dean, Cas)

Castiel walks out of the shelter, standing in the opening between the trees.

Dean follows him closely, watching the angel's eyes light up like every time he ate monster souls when he was still in that creature form. Dean finds his brain drifting away briefly, tempted to ask if Cas remembers everything happened back then but quickly decides now is not the best time.

There are tiny lights like small stars flying from all directions toward Cas. Whatever he's doing, the food source is coming to him like whales feeding in the ocean.

Dean watches the light show with a gaping mouth. "If you can do that, why did we even bother hunting them one by one?" he can't help asking but Cas is probably too occupied to answer him right this moment. Dean just watches the light pouring into Cas's mouth and dissolving into the bright glowing figure he's gradually turning into.

Cas is like an expanding supernova, brightening to as bright as the sun, and more soul lights are still flying toward his open mouth.

Dean's awe quickly turns to panic. "Maybe don't eat all of them, Cas?" he shouts desperately, hoping Cas can still hear him in the middle of the big light circle. "Or take it slowly?"

The incoming souls fly at a slower speed now. Dropped from the shooting bullet speed at the very beginning, now they are just like birds gliding through the air. It seems Cas heard him. Dean breathes a little easier.

Then Cas drops to his knees suddenly, clutching his chest. The incoming lights stop abruptly.

"Cas!" Dean yells, bolting toward him. The light around him gradually dims, so does the light in his pupils.

The veins on Cas's face and neck bulged with a dark black color, writhing under his skin like black worms creeping out.

Dean has seen plenty of freaky shit in his life and this still shoots ice through his spine.

He grabs Cas by the shoulders, steadying him just in case he collapses or throws up -- which, judging by his pale sweaty face and the wriggling black lines in his veins, seems to be the very next thing he's about to do.

Cas's eyes are open but unfocused.

"Talk to me, Cas, buddy, what's wrong?" Dean watches him closely.

Cas's chest rises and falls violently. His breath is so uneven and broken as if he's trying so desperately hard to choke back pain clawing from the inside under control.

Finally, he shifts his eyes onto Dean's face.

"The Leviathans," Cas manages to spit out the word with a croaked voice, even deeper than his usual voice.

"What about them?" Dean's stomach flips. He wipes sweat off Cas's forehead with his fingers -- since when do angels sweat? Cas's skin feels cold -- he's definitely sick if he's a human.

"In me. They're in me and they're alive." Cas croaks. His face furrows deeply, his eyes closed again as if the bare effort of keeping them open exhausts him.

"Oh God," Dean gasps sharply, his blood running cold. He remembers the black goo he fed Cas with when they barely survived that siege, and it was definitely still moving. And he remembers the filthy things can practically glue themselves together no matter how many pieces he cuts them. Which means they are reassembling inside Cas, however that's happening.

"I poisoned you," Dean realizes with horror. "Right when I thought I was helping you recover, I was killing you."

Cas shakes his head with his eyes shut. "Not your fault. We didn't know."

His breathing evens out gradually, Dean still doesn't let his hands go. The black worms in Cas's veins on his face crawl slower and the color is fading. But Dean doesn't know if it means they are handled by whatever angel immune system can do or they just crawl deeper underneath the surface now.

Cas opens his eyes and tries to stand. Dean holds his arms and helps him rise.

"Bad poisonous crab," Cas murmurs.

Dean doesn't understand it for a second, then he cracks up. He laughs so hard that he doesn't even realize he has tears at the corners of his eyes again.

Cas glances at him with a pure joyful glint in his eyes.

"That's gotta be the worst joke in history," Dean comments.

"It's the best if it made you laugh," Cas answers with a small smile of his own.

Dean tilts his head slightly, close to a nod. "Can't argue with that."

Then Cas says quietly, "It's nice to see you laugh like that again."

Dean's smile drops. They both hear the unsaid part: "If it's the last thing I'd ever see again."

Dean swallows again, then asks, "How do you feel?"

"I need to continue," Cas answers simply, "I haven't taken enough power yet."

Dean figures as much, but hearing it still makes his stomach drop, "Any way to filter out the bad food?"

"I can try, but it might be difficult," Cas says.

"Try then," Dean begs.

Cas meets his eyes, giving him a small nod, and the process starts again.

Dean has to retreat a few steps away when the light show resumes. Looking at them long and closely enough, he thinks he can tell the difference between some of them. The soul lights have different sizes and colors, most of them are like sparkling fireworms, tinted with faint colors, white and red are the most common ones. He wouldn't be surprised if red means vampire, which also means must be what his own soul looks like right about now. There are also black spots speckled among the other soul lights, must be Leviathans if he has to guess.

Thankfully, there aren't that many black specks, judging by what he can see. It's a small relief, but it's still not good enough. Dean stands there watching all the light dots flying into Cas's mouth, feeling useless.

Knowing those poisonous monsters will be hurting Cas from inside but he can't do anything, it's almost as bad as watching his mom and his house burn again. The flame of that night's fire is still scorching hot and red at the back of his retina. The bloody shades that would never disappear. And right now, with Cas standing in the middle of the woods, glowing like an exploding star, the memory overlays right onto him.

Dean tastes blood just as he watches and thinks. He hadn't even realized he'd bitten his own lips until the metallic taste spread across his tongue. His throat is already moving automatically to swallow his own blood.

He's a vampire, his guardian angel is turning into a soul bomb with poisonous prebiblical things lurking inside him, and his brother is another puzzle mess they still haven't figured out what's wrong. Welcome to the Winchester freak show.

<br>

The last wave of lights pours into Cas and then there is no more.

Dean is already running toward Cas. A mixture of blood and black goo trickles from the corner of Cas's mouth. Dean's gut twists violently seeing him like this. Black markings bloom from under Cas's collar, creeping up his neck and face like a cobweb-shaped tattoo, except the shape is alive. The dark lines and curves slither beneath his skin, crawling from one side of the cheek through the forehead to the other side. Dean is sure if this were a horror movie, these black worms sure as hell would bite open the skin and crawl right out. Just the thought of that gives him goosebumps.

He has to force his eyes on Cas's, forcing himself on the thought that this is still Cas, whatever form he turns into, just like when he was in the creature form.

"Cas, talk to me, say something," Dean begs.

"You need to go now," Castiel says stiffly without looking at Dean. The voice doesn't sound like him, the squeaks and whispers hidden under the tone as if he has to speak over a whispering crowd below the surface. His hands are clenched into fists, held tightly against his body, straight and rigid, like he's using every bit of strength to keep them there.

Dean reaches out trying to hold Cas's arm, but Castiel yanks away. He raises his hand, palm-up, straight toward the forest clearing. Light and sound of an explosion burst out. A swirly circle the size of a grown man with blue white cloud on the edge erupts open right before their eyes. Dean doesn't have enough time to cover his ears and now they're buzzing badly. He curses loudly and can't hear his own words.

He sees Cas land his eyes on him once again, his lips moving, but Dean can't hear a thing. He gestures at his temporarily deafened ears pitifully.

Cas hovers a hand over his ear, and he can hear again. Better than that, the sound is quiet and peaceful like what he's used to as a human, without the constant pumping of blood running through the veins of every living creature. He touches his gums, and there are no more fangs.

But he doesn't have time to say thank you for fixing him.

"You have to go now," Cas pushes him.

Dean doesn't want to move. "Come with me."

A black tendril moves from Cas's cheek to his eyes, dying his right eye inky black. Staring at Dean with two eyes of different colors, Cas demands with a deep and dark voice, "Go, Dean, don't make me hurt you."

<br>

### Chap. 6 Crimson

> 3 Act: Act 2, plot point 2

#### Act 1 Ext. Purgatory portal (Dean, Cas)

> (Dean POV)
>
> Cas blows up a hole in purgatory to push Dean out (heal him too, transform back to human again), tries to stay behind to keep everything in purgatory not escape by using his body as patch to the hole (and guilty for making the mistake to fail Dean, self-punish)(keep the bad things in the cage)
>
> Dean insists him out too or else he'll jump back in & they'll help fix Cas's leviathan problem, Cas complies finally, drooping leviathan ooze occasionally but mostly can hold them back.

Some of these days, Dean Winchester thinks their life is like a horror movie; other times, he thinks even horror movies would be better and easier to live through than their real life, because he usually can see what's coming. There would be a pattern, a rule, a consensus between monsters and victims and the audience.

But here, right before him, there is no such rule. Which means creepy shit just keeps happening and keeps getting worse and weirder with every move he takes.

Like right about now.

"Cas, fight it, I know you're in there." Dean takes a small step back, just to keep a safe distance from the creature that's taking Cas's form, while just a moment ago, it's Cas taking the creature's. He's going to lose his mind just trying to think this straight.

"I know, because I *am* right here." The black line moves away from Cas's eye, curving across his forehead, arcing from his scalp to the bridge of his nose. Cas continues talking, voice eager and terrified, "Dean, please --"

Immediately, his mouth twists in a curve that Cas's smile never would, and the creature says, "Where else would I be?"

Dean thinks he's definitely about to lose his mind and have nightmares for eternity.

Cas reaches for his arm, pulling him closer as if wanting to hug him one last time, but at the last moment, shoving him toward the portal. His face twitches from the pulling and pushing, black goo continuously dripping from the corner of his mouth.

The gesture is clear enough even if he might not have full control of his voice or eyes.

Dean stares into those eyes, desperately looking for the familiar way they always look back at him. "Cas, I know you can hear me. We can fix this, once we're out there. Bobby's gotta have some book or something, and we can fix you. Just, come home with me."

Dean grabs Cas's wrist, not letting him go. He is right at the edge of the portal now after Cas's push. The swirling cloud circles around his boots, one more step and he's home sweet home.

Cas meets his eyes, the same desperate ache mirrored there. "It's a fight I'll lose sooner or later, Dean," his voice is his own now. "You have to understand. Purgatory is where all the monsters are, that's where I should be."

"Where the hell did you get that idea from?" Dean growls, trying desperately to drag Cas toward the portal.

Cas's hand pulls away easily, then pushes Dean hard. Dean falls to the ground.

"You know, he's not wrong," the Leviathan inside Cas sneers, taking over with a smirk. "He *is* a monster now. Actually, he's many monsters at the moment. Plural."

"Who am I talking to, you dick?" Dean glares through Cas's eyes, looking inside at the dark creature.

"We don't have names," the Leviathan says, cocking Cas's head unnaturally. His neck jerks back like a goose with a broken neck, with his eyes still locked on Dean, as if giving Dean a good look from all angles. "But you may call me Dick."

"Yeah, suits you really well." Dean snorts.

"Now if you'll excuse me, I have a ride to catch, and a world to conquer." Dick takes a large step toward the portal. Dean doesn't know if he wants to help him or stop him anymore.

Cas's legs twist into a knot, his left foot fighting the right, and he tumbles to the ground. Two steps away from the portal now.

Dean rubs a hand over his face. He hates it when he seems to be on the same side as the monster. Cas might be right, they might unleash the worst monster into the world if they let it out, but no way in hell is he going to leave Cas alone in Purgatory. Not after what they've been through down here. Not after all the days and nights they've survived together. Not if there is the tiniest chance of hope. And if he remembers it right, the rest of the Dicks are still out there waiting to eat Cas alive.

"Cas! Come on!" Dean yells.

"I'll close the portal once you are out!" Cas shouts back at him, crawling on the ground using only his hands to pull his body away from the portal. "Go now, Dean!"

"No." Dean makes up his mind. "If you stay, I stay."

"For God's sake, this is like the worst commercial. Can you talk to the idiot angel? Like, really talk?" Dick pops in, looking at Dean through Cas's eyes, "You really don't know why he wants to stay behind?"

Dean glares back at the creature, pissed. "You do?"

"I'm literally in his head, genius. Don't ever say I never did anything for you, *Dean*." Dick mocks his name, then, "That's the way the angel says sorry. Oh and by the way, he doesn't think he's important enough that worth your time to save, all he wants is for you to be happy and safe. There, go figure that out."

Dean is choked for a brief second. He wants to call the hideous creature a liar, but for once, he knows better. He says instead, "I'm not doing this for you."

"Whatever you say," Dick grins.

Cas's face shifts from the smirk to a controlled concentration in a blink.

"Cas, you there?" Taking a deep breath, Dean asks.

"Yes, it's me," Cas pants in a grave voice. His knuckles are white from gripping rocks and stones on the ground, clawing himself farther away from the portal.

Dean kneels down before him, and he has to take a second deep breath. Then he meets Cas's deep blue eyes. He manages to ignore the black tendrils that are still visibly writhing beneath Cas's skin through his veins.

He gives him one of his best smiles. "I thought I was clear enough earlier," Dean tries, eyes flicking to the angel's lips, voice soft, hoping silently that the hinting is good enough.

Cas narrows his eyes slightly in question.

"That you are important to me." Dean has to finish his sentence.

"That I'm not dead." Cas extends the sentence carefully.

"No, not just that." Dean sighs. Why is this so difficult? He squeezes the words out, slowly, like he's learning vocabulary from his own words, "You're important to me, because you are *Cas*. Whatever you do, and whatever you are."

"...Okay," Cas answers reluctantly. It is just so clear the words fail to sink in.

Dean closes his eyes and says desperately, "I will never be happy, if you don't come with me or be safe and happy out there. Is this clear enough?"

Cas blinks. "Oh."

Dean opens his eyes. "Yes."

Cas slowly again. "Oh."

And Dean confirms again. "Yes."

Cas rises slowly to his feet. His two legs are not fighting anymore.

Dean grabs his wrist.

"Come on, let's go home."

<br>

#### Act 2 Int. Bobby's place (Dean, Cas, Sam, Bobby)

> they both back on earth, Dean finds out Sam has issue, ask Cas to check, realize Sam's soulless (Cas doesn't know that until now)
>
> Cas drooping leviathan ooze occasionally but mostly can hold them back.

"Sam, Sam! Gun down! It's us! For God's sake!" Dean ducks just in time for the bullet to fly over his head, whooshing out of the open window. Cas, however, gets one right on his chest.

"Jesus Christ, we should have a 'no gun in room' policy!" Dean rushes to check on Cas, who already removed the bullet and is examining it carefully in his palm. The trench coat has a new bloody bullet hole, but other than that, he looks fine. Dean lets out a breath.

"What's that about? Red alert for enemy angel incoming?" Dean glares at Sam.

Sam shrugs. "Sorry. Muscle memory. Maybe use the door next time."

Dean stares at him unbelievably, "Oh that's your 'welcome back'? 'Use the door next time'? That's -- that's just great. Really heartwarming."

Dean turns around to look for Bobby.

Bobby meets his eyes, giving him a nod and a tight smile, "Welcome back, Dean." Throwing a glance in Cas's direction, he adds, "Looks like your angel found you, like he promised."

Dean nods, glancing back at Cas as well. Black goo dripping from Cas's fingertips slowly forms a small black puddle on the floor.

"He ain't lookin' so hot though. Any new problem we gotta deal with?" Bobby asks with an unsurprised annoyed look.

Dean doesn't even bother acting surprised or offended at that. "Yeah, about that..."

Sam doesn't shift his gaze or aim at Cas since the two of them fly in.

"What are you?" Sam demands coldly.

Cas answers him, "I'm still me. Castiel, Angel of the Lord."

"Then what's this?" Sam scoffs, motioning at the black slime and the pulsing veins beneath Cas's skin with the muzzle of his pistol.

"And how'd you two come outta Purgatory?" Bobby adds questions to the pile. "Are you still a vamp, Dean?"

"No fangs now, thanks to Cas." Dean starts with the easy question, then hurries toward Cas, sheltering him with his body, and points a finger sharply at Sam's gun, "Put that thing down, will ya? No one points a gun at anyone in this house. Not on my watch."

"That's my line," Bobby mumbles.

"Only if you explain what's wrong with him." Sam doesn't give in. "Not my fault he looks like he wants to eat me or kill me. I'm only self-defense."

Dean tries to pull Cas away but the angel doesn't move.

"Cas absorbed the souls in Purgatory to juice up and blow a hole to save both of us, with a little side effect we need to figure out how to fix." Dean is genuinely pleased he actually managed to summarize everything downstairs in one sentence.

"Which is?" Bobby prompts, sharp eyes shifting between them.

"There's this monster in Purgatory -- Leviathans." Dean considers how to best put it, "Well apparently, according to angels, these things are so nasty and impossible to kill, God had to create a whole jail just to lock them up."

"Let me guess, now they are in Cas, hitched a ride and ready to have some fun outside the jail?" Bobby says gloomily.

"Something like that." Dean considers. "You know what, exactly like that."

"And how are you gonna kill some monsters not even God knew how to kill?" Bobby squints at him.

Dean says, simply, "We'll figure something out. Now your turn," he turns to Sam. "What's your problem?"

Sam shrugs. "Nothing?"

"You haven't been right since Stull Cemetery." Dean frowns, then glances at Bobby, "Tell me he looks sketchy to you too."

Bobby levels the look. "I didn't live with him or go hunting with him every day."

"You don't need to live with him to know. Just look at him!" Dean can't help himself, raising his voice.

"Don't you start lecturing me in my house, boy," Bobby grumbles. "But yeah, he volunteered to kill Cas, do the math."

"What the hell?" Dean looks at Sam unbelievably.

"And maybe some other folks he didn't want us to know about," Bobby adds.

Sam defends. "That's Cas's idea, he killed a lot more than I did when you were gone, Dean. I told him to let you go but he wouldn't listen."

"I was just trying to save Dean," Cas defends too.

"What's wrong with all of you?!" Dean throws his hands up, staring at them one at a time, "Am I the only moral compass in the room now?"

Sam shrugs again. Cas tilts his head toward him.

Bobby answers, "Guess that's why they need you."

Dean sighs. "Alright then, one problem at a time. Let's figure out what's wrong with Sam. Cas, little help?"

"I'm not a human doctor," Cas states, perplexed.

"We don't exactly have a post-Hell syndrome human doctor, do we?" Dean is trying his best to manage his temper but it's near the limit. "Can't you use your new mojo or something to figure it out?"

Cas approaches Sam on the sofa, who still refuses to let go of his pistol. Dean snatches it from him. "You know it's not gonna do anything to him anyway."

"Not if I've got angel-killing bullets," Sam meets both Dean and Cas's eyes, Dean's glaring with burning flame. "Just saying."

Cas reaches a hand toward Sam's forehead, a gesture to test his body temperature. Sam leans back, away from him. "Not that I'm prejudiced or anything," Sam points at Cas's Leviathan problem, "You sure it's not contagious or anything?"

Cas turns to Dean for help.

"How the hell would I know?" Dean says grumpily. Honestly, it hadn't even crossed his mind when he was hauling and dragging Cas out of Purgatory. But just to be on the safe side, "Fine, no touching then. Cas, can you do that?"

Cas hums quietly, holding his diagnostic hand about six inches from Sam. Sam just stares at him.

"His soul is missing," Cas concludes bluntly after a moment.

Dean looks back and forth between them. "His soul?! How's that even possible? Where is it then?"

"My guess is... Still with Michael and Lucifer, in the Cage." Cas answers, his feet shifting on the floor.

"Whoever brought me back did a really shitty job, it looks like," Sam comments.

Cas looks down uneasily, opening his mouth but no words comes out.

Dean studies him, "Did you... It's not you, is it, Cas? Brought Sam back without his soul?"

Cas swallows, shame clouding his face. "I didn't realize it at the time. I'm sorry." He doesn't meet their eyes. "It's not easy to save someone from the Cage with both Michael and Lucifer in it, you must understand. They were not exactly in a good mood."

Sam scoffs. "'Not easy.' Yeah, sure. You got Dean back pretty decently, with everything put back together, wrapped in a gift box with a cherry on top."

"Sam! Not helping." Dean barks.

"I said I'm sorry, I truly am," Cas says. "And I intend to fix it."

"Sorry doesn't do shit," Sam mocks. "You got a plan to go downstairs to Hell any time soon?"

"Sam! We just came back!" Dean feels like he's trapped in the middle of a crossfire. Middle-east is probably an even easier place to go at this time of the year. "We'll make a plan, and then we go and fetch it, right, Cas?"

"I fully intend to return to the Cage again," Cas promises solemnly, directly to Sam now. "I only wish for your forgiveness, for this is one of my many mistakes."

"Cas, don't!" Dean doesn't know if anyone is even still listening to him, feeling nothing more than a clown spinning his wheels in the middle of a ballroom.

"Guys." Bobby's voice cuts in.

Sam and Cas are still heated in their bristling. Dean wants to slam his head against the wall if it can pull the two of them apart.

"Guys!" Bobby calls again with a higher volume. "We got a visitor."

Dean looks up, recognizing the guy in the V-collar shirt and casual suit. Only one man in the whole world dresses like that -- one angel, to be specific.

<br>

### Chap. 7 Grey

> 3 Act: Act 3, twist, climax, wrap up
>
> (add setting: the more Cas use god power, the more leviathan-corrupted he is, so they can't keep asking him doing things; Dean keep worry about Cas's condition, Cas still morally grey but only light grey)

#### Act 1 Int. Bobby's house - Day (Dean, Cas, Sam, Bobby, Balthazar)

> They need to fight off Raphael & go to Cage to face Michael/Lucifer to save Sam's soul, so combine the two tasks together. Cas wants to go do all these alone, Dean doesn't let him
>
> argument, even fight a little (Cas still a bit grey, beat Dean to protect him, then heal him), eventually agree do everything together, live or die

"Balthazar." Castiel walks toward him slowly.

Dean and Bobby trade a look. Never any good news when angels make house calls. They learned it the hard way.

"A bit busy here," Dean says, not in his friendliest manner. "What do you want?"

"Knew I'd find you here, Cas." Balthazar straightforwardly ignores Dean, speaking directly to Castiel. "Haven't seen you in a while."

Cas squints slightly. "We met recently."

"Yes, yes, but not after you got a full system upgrade." Balthazar stops moving when he's in front of Castiel at least two steps away. "You forgot to share your summer plans with the rest of the class, Cas. We are worried."

Dean eyes them skeptically. "Didn't see you helping if you're really that worried," he chimes in.

Balthazar gestures at him casually, still talking with Cas, "I see you're still hanging out with the hairless apes. To be honest, I'm surprised your newly charged batteries haven't burned their eyes out yet."

That gets Dean's attention. "What the hell are you talking about?"

Balthazar finally meets him in the eyes, "Oh, am I the only one in the room noticing our Cas here is buzzing with energy? Upstairs already got a power meter overload, red alerts everywhere. Last time it happened, let me see, ah, never. Not once since God left the building." He turns back to Castiel, "You are about all God-level power now, Cas. Let me guess, you already found Purgatory and took everything? That's practically blowing the battle horn. Want to take a bet on how fast Uncle Raphael will find out and come pay a visit?"

"God power, you say?" Dean tenses, turning sharply to Cas. "How many souls did you take exactly, Cas?"

Sam cuts in triumphantly, "That's what I've been trying to say but you wouldn't listen, Dean." He picks up his pistol again, gesturing at Castiel. "The angel-killing bullet didn't do anything to him because he's not an angel anymore!"

"You could have killed him!" Too much information dropped, Dean feels his head throbbing with fury and ache. He doesn't even want to know where Sam got angel-killing bullets from.

He wants to find a paper and writes down all the things that need saving, and then crumples the paper and throws it out of the window.

Cas is already making decisions for his next moves. "I'll take the fight to Raphael before he comes here," he says to Balthazar, but his eyes flash Dean a quick glance. "Then I need to go to the Cage to meet Michael and Lucifer again."

"Aren't you the busiest guy today, meeting three archangels in a day, is that a family dinner thing for your first day as God?" Balthazar remarks dryly.

Cas doesn't answer.

The two of them start heading outside.

"Cas, no, don't, bad plan." Dean doesn't know what else to do except for stopping Cas on his way out. But they probably don't even need a door to get out. "Please, let's think about it. What about your little... Leviathan problem?"

"What about it?" Cas looks down at his hands. The black ooze is not dripping as much as it did when they first came back, but sure enough, he's still not fully well and himself.

"You're like a trunk load of nuclear weapons, can't risk having the enemy get their hands on the red button, don't you think?" Dean reasons. "What are you gonna do if Dick takes over again when you're fighting Raphael or Lucifer?"

"Then I die," Cas answers simply. "Or I don't die, and the Leviathans kill the archangels, because rock beats scissors, Leviathan beats angel."

"Which always leaves the biggest shark in the tank, exactly." Dean suggests. "So why don't we take it strategically, eh? Throw all of them in the same tank, let them tear each other apart. We watch on the bench with popcorn, how about that?"

"What happens to the winner?" Cas tilts his head.

"Nothing. Whoever wins wins, but they are still in the tank -- in our case, it's the Cage." Dean says cheerfully, "If the Cage really is as good as everyone says it is, then we can just leave them there forever, all problems solved. No one dies and we come home happily ever after."

Cas thinks about it. "It might actually work."

A dark black vein creeps up Cas's cheek as he speaks, moving over his eye momentarily. Cas blinks rapidly, far too many times. Then with an over-compensated smile, he says over enthusiastically, "Thank you, Dean. That's some really good advice. I'll definitely take it."

Castiel's body turns toward the door, ready to head out again.

"Hey, Dick," Dean calls after him. "You do know it includes you too, right? In fact, I will personally make sure you're torn to pieces by the other big players, 'cause you're the worst."

"And how exactly do you plan to do that?" Castiel's eyes glance at him with a cold black color.

"Start with helping Cas get back the control wheel." Dean takes a breath, clenching his hands into fists. "You know what's the biggest advantage that Cas has but you don't?"

"Angel's big blue puppy eyes?" Dick smirks.

Dean looks at him straight. "Me."

"Then I'd just kill you first." Dick grabs Dean by the collar and hurls him across Bobby's junkyard.

Dean's back hits a tree trunk with a sickening thud, he can hear the bones shifting and cracking as he climbs to his feet slowly with a suppressed pained smile. "I was hoping you'd say that."

Dick in Castiel's body stalks toward him in a beeline, but stumbles slightly on the steps. The monster doesn't seem to notice. "I don't see how getting yourself killed can help your precious little angel friend in here."

Dick chokes Dean's throat in one hand, and starts using the other fist to punch his face.

Dean's pretty sure his nose is broken by the third or fourth hit. His face feels sticky, but he doesn't even bother blocking the punches. He drops to his knees, beaten and swaying.

"'Cause you missed the private session." Dean keeps the grin on his totally messed-up face, cracked and bloody.

*Come on, Cas. Take back control.*

"I see everything the angel sees," Dick beats him on the head with Castiel's hand, "I hear everything he hears. We are one." The fist is as heavy as iron, Dean sees stars in front of his eyes. He prays harder.

*Cas, come on. Need more motivation than this? I'm keeping him busy here, but not for long.*

The next punch that's aiming for his eye socket averts the direction midway, ends up grazing past his ear.

Dean can barely keep his eyes open around the swelling. His breath is choked short.

*Cas, come back to me. I need you. I know you're stronger than these bastards. Come back to me if you love me.*

The grip on his throat loosens. Dean looks up, running right into the unmistakable blue eyes of Cas's.

The next hand reaching toward him touches his forehead with two fingers. Dean can practically hear all the bones and flesh in his body and on his face shift back to where they should, the bruises healing, the wounds knitting back together.

"Welcome back," Dean tells Cas.

"How long have you known it wasn't me?" Cas pulls him up from his knees.

"Since you were too eager to jump into the tank with the big guns alone without even asking. We had an agreement, didn't we?" Dean leads them both back into the house.

"And how did you know that would work?" Cas looks at him with a disapproving look, "I could have killed you."

"One, it wasn't you." Dean counts with his fingers, pointing the "one" at Cas to get more of his attention. "And two, I knew now you'd do anything to stop any harm in my way, so I figured that should be enough motivation to get back behind the wheel."

Cas ducks his head. Quiet. Then, "Dean, now that I'm myself again, may I propose that we go to Heaven then Hell together?"

Dean answers with a smile. "Don't use 'propose' like that again unless you mean honeymoon. And yeah, let's kick some fat asses."

#### Act 1 Ext. Heaven - Day (Cas, Dean, Raphael)

> Cas&Dean go to Raphael and fight with his god+leviathan part, Raphael is no match, Cas drag him to Cage to force him to watch

This isn't Dean's first time visiting Heaven, but it is definitely the first time visiting Heaven at war.

He's not sure what he expected, but it certainly wasn't troops lined up face-to-face on an open field, all armored with helmets and swords -- ancient Greek style.

"Thought you guys should be more fancy and modern by now," Dean murmurs under his breath to Cas, as they approach the center of the field.

"This is the largest field we have," Cas replies quietly. "We're in Achilles's chamber, so we adapt. Not many warriors want to spend eternity on battlefields, so there aren't many open lands like this."

"Fair." Dean can relate.

The field stretches wild, one side opening to the sea, the other against a high city wall. Their itinerary doesn't include going to Troy today, though.

Dean notices the force that gathers near the city wall is easily outnumbered by the other side tens or hundreds of times over.

"That yours?" Dean nods toward the outnumbered group.

Cas nods. "I did my best, and those are all the angels believing in free will and humanity. I'm disappointed in my siblings," he explains.

"Don't be too hard on them," Dean studies them from afar, can't quite make out their figures as all look exactly the same in their identical uniforms. "I'd say that's already a decent amount turning around from being total douchbags in a day."

"I expected more from my brothers and sisters," Cas states simply, then, "But it doesn't matter today. Today, it's only with Raphael."

"One-on-one dueling style?" Dean eyes him from the side.

"I believe so." Cas scans the field.

"Does that make me your stable boy or squire or something?" Dean suddenly frowns lightly. "You got one of those shiny fighting dresses I can assist you to wear?"

Castiel is almost flustered, turning to face Dean directly. "No, Dean, you're not my servant. I would never ask you to do such a thing."

"Easy, Prince, just a joke." Dean chuckles.

<br>

They arrive at the center of the field with maybe a hundred thousand eyes on them. Dean spots Balthazar standing at the front of Cas's army. On the opposite side, Raphael shows up in a female vessel.

The two of them step into the very center line between the two troops. Raphael meets them there with a stoic look. Two of her angels stand guard ten paces behind her. Dean doesn't really know if anything happened to Raphael, what's the use of them -- surely something can't be handled by an archangel is above average paygrade angels.

"Are you here to surrender, Castiel?" Raphael calls haughtily.

"No, Raphael, I'm here to hear yours," Castiel answers with equal pride.

"What makes you think you can survive another crush from my wrath?" Raphael lifts a hand, thunderbolts crackling between her fingers.

So much for negotiating.

"Everything," Castiel replies, as his eyes ignite.

Clouds churn and tumble across the fake sky, sunlight vanishing into a storm-dark canopy. The bright day fades into a dark gloomy afternoon before a fierce storm rolling in. Lightning splits the horizon, thunder rumbling like the beat of war drums. The whole ground trembles beneath their feet.

Dean has a feeling the quake is not just limited to Achilles's Heaven chamber. The vibration is shaking every inch of Heaven. The once steady and organized angel troops stir uneasily, gasping at the sky, all eyes staring at Castiel.

"You found the most unholy place and contaminated yourself with it," Raphael condemns, her voice thin against the wind and thunder. She brandishes a long golden angel blade, held high in her right hand. The blade has spiral edges like a goat horn from one of those old medieval biblical paintings -- different from the usual angel blades Dean's used to seeing.

Castiel is unmoved by the menace of the blade. He steps forward, grabs Raphael by the throat, and lifts her clean off the ground.

Raphael roars in fury, lights flashing around her, mirroring the lightning above the sky. Six enormous wings stretch out from behind her back.

Castiel does not even blink. His grip on Raphael's throat tightens, as effortless as squeezing a fly.

The light from the archangel's wings flickers. She dangles pitifully in midair like a ragged doll, struggling vainly against Castiel's grasp.

With a last desperate try, Raphael throws her blade out, aiming for Castiel's chest. The blade barely pierces the trench coat before dropping into the dirt, point down.

Raphael's eyes widen with fear and uncertainty. Her two squire angels draw their swords and shields out and ready, but they do not approach.

The war is ended before it even begins.

"I could kill you with a snap," Cas informs the archangel with his low grave voice, black goo drips from his fingers onto Raphael's throat, slipping beneath the armor she's wearing.

Raphael still has the remnant of burning fury in her eyes, but the flame is dying into charred ash by each minute. The archangel knows by now she does not have any chance of turning the tide, so she is wise enough not to even bother trying.

"What do you want to do then?" Raphael challenges.

Dean glances at Cas, who apparently has the answer prepared long before coming to the place.

"You might enjoy a reunion with your brothers," Cas renders the verdict. "Come with us to Hell."

<br>

#### Act 2 Int. Hell, Cage (Cas, Dean, Raphael, Michael, Lucifer)

> Cas drag Raphael to Cage to force him to watch
>
> Cas go into Cage in god+leviathan form, fight off Lucifer+Michael (all 4 archangels together can win God-level power, but still can't win Leviathan, "rock beats scissor, leviathan beats angel"). Cas force grab Sam and Adam's soul back, fix them (heal/wipe broken memories, give Adam a new body), lock Michael/Lucifer back into Cage for Earth's sake (Adam's soul+body asleep, Sam's soul in a briefcase)
>
> Cas threaten ask Raphael if he will obey him now, Raphael fake comply, curse him fake God actual monster and most deserve the Cage, willing for mutual destruction and push Cas together fall into Cage

The Hell ride is much smoother than Dean expects. Not a single demon in sight, not even Crowley. The stairs downward are an empty endless spiral stairs. It's only one step away from having a red-carpet homecoming party, another step in the other direction to be just a deserted construction site.

They fly down to the lowest level.

The Cage hangs in an absolutely dark space with all but nothingness. Not even a single source of light.

Cas conjures a torch and hands it to Dean.

The Cage is chained by eight long thick iron chains, each locked on one corner of its cubical shape. Countless smaller strings extend from its edges and sides, taut like the threads of a spiderweb. The box does not swing the slightest in midair.

Dean has to admit, this place looks a thousand times worse than the Pit. And he isn't even inside it yet.

"Sam's in there?" Dean whispers with a bump in his throat.

Cas nods quickly, his fingers nimbly dancing on the thinnest strings in the space that Dean doesn't even notice exists. Cas touches and tunes them one by one like unlocking the most complicated lock in history. Dean's eyes follow his fingers' movement closely, awed by the precision and complexity.

It indeed looks quite impossible to get in or out of that thing, by the look of its security system. Dean feels so much more confident about locking up some bad guys in there.

The last string loosens with a tiny clank. The top of the Cage opens automatically.

"Watch," Cas orders Raphael. With a snap of his fingers, one side of the Cage turns transparent.

Inside, two archangels and two slightly glowing lights in the vague shape of human figures crowd in there like caged animals at a crappy zoo.

Cas turns to Dean. "I would have asked you to wait here too, Dean."

Dean glances at the glass cage. "But Sam's in there."

"That's why I said 'would have', you wouldn't agree anyway." Cas nods in understanding.

He flies both of them into the Cage.

<br>

Sam's soul curls into a tiny ball on itself at the farthest corner from Lucifer. Adam and Michael take another corner. Lucifer has more than half the space to himself, and he is singing the worst off-key tune at the top of his volume: "Camptown ladies sing this song, Doo-dah, doo-dah! Camptown racetrack five miles long, Oh, doo-dah day!" Sam's soul trembles whenever Lucifer glances his way.

"Dean Winchester and Castiel," Lucifer stops pacing around the Cage, turning to them, grinning wide. "Aren't I lucky to have two visitors in one day? Sammy, Mikey, wakey wakey, we've got company!"

Of all the angels and demons, Lucifer has still managed to be the worst in every sense.

Dean wonders why Michael and Lucifer still haven't choked each other to death after one year in here.

"Because we're besties, aren't we, Mikey?" Lucifer reads his mind -- or maybe just randomly guessed right his thoughts.

Michael pays him no attention.

Dean rushes toward Sam's soul.

The poor thing is so tortured it shivers at even the smallest movement or change of sound in the air. Its light flickers weakly as Dean approaches. He reaches a hand toward the core of this cloud of light, and the soul screams in pain and terror. Dean stares at this thing that's supposed to host Sam's memories and past, the part that makes Sam *Sam*, but looking at it now, he fears he's not making the right decision.

Dean looks down at the glowing light shape in agony, having a moment of Deja Vu -- it is no different from holding little Sammy's cradle and dashing through the fire. And now the fire when he was four is back, trapping him again. He freezes.

Castiel is a little too busy to help Dean right now. He is reaching for Adam when Michael starts moving -- the first sign that shows he's still alive. Cas almost gets Adam, and that's when Michael attacks without any foretold, like a cat suddenly leaps into a nest of birds. His archangel blade appears in his palm in no time and stabs at Cas, Adam falls back into Michael's arms.

Cas shifts to the side, dodging the blade. Michael may be fast, but God power is faster.

On the other side, Lucifer coordinates his strike as if the two of them have practiced it a dozen times against a common enemy. Right as Castiel jumps out of Michael's reach, Lucifer's blade sinks into the small of his back.

Castiel lets out a low stifled sound of pain. Dean looks up sharply, shaking off all the shock and heavy memories, and scrambles to his feet, rushing to his side to help.

"Don't worry, I'm not hurt," Cas tells him calmly. Hovering his hand over the wound, the stab stops bleeding and the flesh knits itself back together.

"We should get going," Dean urges, tugging his arm.

"Michael won't let Adam go," Cas replies, frowning.

"You can't Obi-Wan him into it?" Dean suggests.

Cas raises a questioning eyebrow.

Dean clarifies, "Use your God mojo and make him."

"Not so much on archangels," Cas admits.

"You know what else archangels can do?" Lucifer chirps. "Not even God's power is all invincible. We locked God's sister away once, just the four of us. We are two short, but Castiel, don't forget you are not Father, you are only playing Father. When I get out, and when you run out of that power, I'll crunch you between my teeth."

Before Castiel can say anything, Dean already jumps in front of him, landing a punch on Lucifer's face.

Lucifer gets slammed into the wall by his side, and Dean breaks his wrist.

Dean turns to look, blinking -- it definitely wasn't his punch that blew the Devil away. It was Castiel extending a hand like a palm cannon, holding Lucifer down. The Devil is silenced for the moment.

Dean rushes to his side. Cas heals him with the lightest touch of his free hand.

"Can you cure Sam too?" Dean asks, breathless, too overwhelmed worrying about everyone and everything. "Wipe those Hell memories for him or whatever horror he had to live through?"

Cas edges to Sam's soul, placing a gentle palm over that trembling cloud of light. The bloody pink surface that looks awful lot like flayed skin in boiling water starts calming down. Dean watches the bubbling light cloud slowly ease down, reminded of how the crybaby Sammy used to be coaxed to sleep when he was still wrapped in a warm swaddle. Dean doesn't realize since when does a small smile curling onto his lips.

They manage to steal Adam too, in the end, with a small diversion strategy to draw Michael away from what's probably his favorite human pet or whatever's been going on between them.

Michael growls at them furiously as Cas leaps out of the Cage with Dean -- along with Sam's soul and Adam's soul and broken body.

Behind them, they can hear Lucifer unleashing his rage on his brother, and Michael returns the favor. Dean is too busy watching Cas and their rescues to notice any more of their little activities.

Once outside, Castiel turns full-on into a god of healing -- patching Sam up with more delicacy than the rushed emergency patch a moment ago, then Adam. Fixing Adam's shattered body takes nearly as much effort as healing his soul, but Castiel finishes the work in the end. All the while Dean is thinking if that's exactly how Cas fixed his or Sam's body too -- the Winchester's guardian angel fixing all three brothers, is it a miracle or a duty fulfilled?

Raphael watches him do the work.

"Why do you care about them so much?" Raphael asks abruptly.

Castiel meets Dean's eyes and considers it for a long moment before answering. "Because someone important to me taught me to, they changed me to care, so now I care for them, I care for all of them."

Dean can't hide his proud grin.

Raphael considers his answer, but to be honest, Dean doesn't think she even has the capability of understanding any of that. And he wouldn't exactly find it surprising.

"What now?" Raphael wonders aloud.

"Obey me and give up Apocalypse, or you get locked in that Cage like Michael and Lucifer. Choose wisely," Castiel demands.

It's the same tone Cas used that night about two years ago when he told the archangel, "Today, you're our bitch."

That is victory right there. They should have more of these, just as rewards for all the trouble of saving the world. Dean thinks. Or maybe something as small as a straight twenty-four hours of peaceful sleep. He can appreciate that too.

"Fine," Raphael says after a long pause, kneeling down slowly with her head jerked high and defiant. "This good enough?"

"Attaboy," Dean beams, glancing at Cas.

"I'm glad," Castiel tells him, resting a gentle hand on the archangel's shoulder. Raphael scoffs.

"But for your past attempt of splitting the angels, for starting a war, there will be punishment," Castiel continues to announce. "The punishment, is the rest of your life in the Cage."

What the hell? Dean gapes in shock, staring at Cas.

His angel doesn't look back, only heading toward the Cage's door once again, dragging the archangel with him. Dark lines coil across his skin. Dean's heart sinks.

Raphael is forced to follow him, eyes full of disgust.

The two of them stop at the opening of the Cage.

"You know, there is a better place for a monster like you -- Purgatory, because you are more monster than God, Castiel. You've always been a monster. A disaster," Raphael spits. "I see what you really are. If anyone deserves to rot in the Cage for eternity, it's you. I'm doing this for the world."

Before Dean can react, before he can even blink, Raphael grabs Castiel by the shoulder, and hurls them both over the edge into the Cage.

"NO!!" Dean screams, desperate, only to watch Castiel's body fall.

The lid of the Cage slams shut automatically.

<br>

"No, no, no! Not again!" Dean pounds on the glass window of the Cage. The material is definitely not really glass, and it's most certainly one-sided and soundproof.

He can do nothing except for watching the sick bully show playing out inside -- the brutal shark in tank show with Cas's body on the meat hook.

The three archangels fall into alliance within seconds. Cas's eyes flicker between blue and black, Leviathan goo continuously falling out of him in thick strings.

Lucifer jump-starts the first round of attack, with Michael -- now without Adam, he is more involved in the activity as well -- on Cas's left flank, and Raphael on his right. Castiel's body shakes like a winter leaf under their strikes, the archangels stab him with their spiral blades, punching and kicking and beating him from every direction.

Within seconds, Castiel's body collapses to the ground, blood and goo flowing from broken joints and torn flesh. His eyes droop sluggishly with barely any light in the pupils.

*Cas, come on, stand up.*

Dean presses his palm against the Cage wall, begging desperately.

The prayer must have reached him, for the angel turns his head toward the side of the wall Dean's near. The attacks from the three archangels continue landing, but he seems to forget about them for just a moment.

Dean watches him hopelessly.

Castiel's broken lips move. Once, with three words. Then, with another three.

Dean doesn't need to hear or know about lip language to recognize them.

*I'm sorry.*

*I love you.*

"NO!!" Dean slams the wall of the Cage with all his force. His fists are covered with his own blood.

That is when Castiel's eyes brighten up. It lights up the whole dark space like a sun, and it continues growing and glowing, blazing into an exploding supernova.

Dean shuts his eyes close but even then, the blue white light sears through his eyelids, burning his vision bright, turning the dark world bloody red.

The sound is isolated inside the Cage, so is all the energy unleashed. The Cage barely shakes when the light recedes.

*Cas.*

Dean opens his eyes the moment he decides it's not going to blind him. He doesn't even realize he's sobbing when tears streak down his cheeks. He doesn't have the courage to look back into the Cage again for a long minute.

The Cage is a post-explosion debris. White smoke hasn't fully dissipated, colors smudging all over the space -- red is blood, black is Leviathan goo, mixing together with white and blue light, like a distained tragic scene after massive deaths, a battlefield from Picasso's paintings and Homer's poems.

*I love you too.* Dean presses his forehead against the glass, breath uneven, tears shredding. His lips tremble with one word: "Cas."

A sudden bloody hand slams against the wall from inside, leaving a trace of bloody handprints as it pulls a broken body up slowly into view. Matching Dean's hand on the other side.

Dean's heart pounds violently in his chest, so loud that he's sure the whole dark space would echo the sound of his heartbeat. He holds his breath, until Castiel's face emerges, until Cas slowly, gradually climbs out of the Cage on his own. In one piece.

Dean wraps his arms around him immediately.

"I thought I lost you," he tells him. His voice still wet.

"I thought so too," Cas answers honestly.

"What happened?"

"I exploded, and the energy from the Leviathans and the archangels cancelled each other out." Cas tilts his head. "Looks like the sharks killed each other, in the end."

Dean holds the angel's face, brushing blood from his cheeks with trembling fingers, examining his features carefully. There are no more dark veins with poisonous black worms crawling across, no black goo dripping. No sign of Dick anywhere. And judging by the mess inside Cage, no sign of the other feathery dicks as well.

Dean can't help laughing like a lunatic. "We gotta work on your jokes, it's even worse than the crab one."

Cas opens his mouth to retort, but Dean doesn't give him any chance.

Dean presses his lips onto Castiel's, drinking in every last bittersweet flavor in him. Cas returns the kiss without hesitation.

Dean closes his eyes. "Don't ever do that again."

Cas pauses. "The kissing?"

Dean chuckles. "No, dumbass, the dying."

He pulls the angel back into his hold and doesn't let go.

<br>

They stay until the King of Hell finally can't take it any longer and declares the "Public Museum of the Cage" is officially closed at this time of the year.

They arrive home with Sam's soul in a suitcase and their half-brother in the back seat. Dean knocks on Bobby's door with a stupid smile.

No one dies today. No world-ending event scheduled for next week. Everyone safe and sound with all monsters gone.

Talk about a big win.

Dean walks into Bobby's house giving the old man a tight hug. He gives Sam one too, after Cas puts his soul back.

Bobby asks how's the trip.

Dean says, with a wide grin, "Wouldn't recommend for honeymoon spots, one out of ten for Heaven, zero for Hell, negative infinity for Purgatory. And we might have missed a few steps before that."

He winks at Cas. "We're working on that."

<br>

#### draft notes

"I should have said this earlier," Dean says, after finally dragging himself away from the entangled tongues. He looks at Cas in the eyes, the ocean-blue eyes looking him right back.

"You don't have to say it," Cas answers, "I heard your prayers."

"It's important," Dean insists, then takes a slow, long breath. "I love you."

Cas smiles as if the whole universe's light is gathering on him again.

"I love you too."
