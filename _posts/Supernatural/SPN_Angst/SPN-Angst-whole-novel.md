The impala is parked in the back alley by the two-story building. The place doesn't have light on, but some of the windows are broken, taste of copper and blood floating outside. One can only imagine how much blood must have been spilled inside the place for the back alley to smell the same.

Sam and his grandfather hurry out of their van, rushing into the place, machete ready in hands.

There are bodies without head all the way from the stairs leading to the main hall. The red carpet of blood -- but not human blood, vampire's.

Sam glances that the separated heads rolling around on the floor, seeing fangs with dripping blood. None of them move an inch anymore.

Samuel sees the same, catching his grandson's eyes, nodding at the only entrance towards the larger opening. Both of them walking fast and quiet, trained hunter steps. With machetes tight in hands, dead man's blood in the back pocket, just in case.

The place is quiet. Too quiet. Even their silent footsteps might become the source of an echo.

And then, there is the sound of fighting again. Yelling and pulling, metal hitting each other, fist punching face.

They dash into the main ball room.

Dean is covered in blood, his own or others they do not know. The bigger vampire that bit him earlier has a smirk on his face, pulling his collar and throwing him into the ground like he weighs nothing. Dean lets out an angry growl, rolling on the ground in time to dodge a fierce direct blow in the face, grabbing the knife he dropped and jumping back on his feet, circling the other vampire, eyes bloody, pupil dilated.

Sam hesitates. Samuel eyes him.

"Don't want to hurt Dean." Sam whispers, not moving ahead, not throwing himself into the vampire fight.

Dean gets wrestled and tripped by the other vampire, legs entangled, can't move easily. That monster is so much stronger than he is. And by the look of fighting, several hundred years of living isn't teaching him nothing.

Dean can't breathe, fingers fumbling on the face of the bigger man, scratching his eye socket, leaving bloody fingernail marks, but the other man does not move away. Dean's movement gets slacker, arms slumping to the ground.

The other vampire lets the grip loose, Sam catches the break and marches forward, but he's still two steps too far away when the vampire dives to the silver knife Dean left behind, cuts his head off in clean move. Sam's machete slides through his throat right in the next second.

Two heads roll away from their bodies, blood spilling everywhere, mostly on Sam's face.

Sam flinches, staring at his brother's head, gasping loud. "Dean!"

Dean's eyes are still wide open, green, reflecting the colors on the reflective carving glass on the high ceiling. And then the lights go out. The fangs still out, ugly, covering his own teeth.

"Oh my God!" Sam kneels down by his brother's body, hands on his shoulder, inhaling heavily.

Samuel looks away, swallowing hard.

So much for going out swinging.

So much for the half retiring and apple-pie life.

Sam helps him close the eyes. And knits his head back to his body, later. With floss.

He burns his brother's body on a pyre. And then drives away in his car.

The town is left behind in the rear mirror.

Soon, the whole state of Illinois is left behind miles away.

The vampire nest was set to fire before they left. Any other bodies or signs of life burned to the ashes.

<br>

Dean wakes up in a gasp, touching his neck reflectively. The skin on the neck complete, his head still connected to his body.

"What the hell?" He looks around. The sky grey, the trees all half dying around him. The whole place creeps him out, but the most creepy thing is, he seems still alive.

He touches his upper gum. The fangs are still pointy there, mostly hidden, for now.

"Okay? So not dead, but still a fucking vamp." He says to himself, disgusted. Eyeing around again, his fingers fumble to the back of his belt, but fail to find a weapon.

Hunter's instinct kicks in just in time, his body moves before his ears catch the sound. Something jumps on him from the back, Dean rushes around, elbowing it in the face, arms wrapping its neck until it stops moving. Dean drops the body and recognizes the face of a young boy -- the young vampire boy he sure as hell cuts the head off no more than a few hours ago, before he somehow gets transmitted into this weird land.

"You're dead." Dean frowns at the motionless -- probably just passed out -- body, thinking aloud. Realization dawns on him. "Which means I'm dead too. God dammit!"

Dean kicks on the trunk of a tree closest to him with all his force, frustratedly. "Fuck!"

It's just a vampire case, very everyday job. He does not expect to check out just like that. Not today. But apparently he did.

He kicks again, as if it can make him feel better. "So what? This is some monsterland the dead vamp would go and I'm stuck here forever?"

No one answers his question, except for some more creatures lurking closer because of his noise.

Looks like more than vampires then, Dean concludes, thinking he sees something that definitely look like a werewolf and another like wendigo. Every freaking monster he and his brother and every hunter has ever killed would be here then. And if they remember him in the whatever afterlife memory thing they still have, they sure as hell would be thrilled to see him hanging around with them. Dean realizes.

That's when he picks a direction, and starts running into the creepy woods. The growls and howling of every kind of monsters that ever existed sounding around him like the most dedicated freaky monster symphony.

He has nothing but his hands and feet. And his fangs. Almost like a weird comfort now, come to think of it.

It's gonna be a bloody long eternity.

<br>

Sam is two states over when Cas drops by.

The case looks like an angelic weapon case. Sam tells him, people dying because of telling truths.

"Looks like it's your department?" Sam points at a picture of Gabriel's Horn of Truth to him.

Cas flies away and back in two seconds. Nothing angelic in the town. He tells him.

Sam snorts. "Where did you look?"

"Everywhere." Cas looks him in the eyes, then looks around. It's a single bed motel room, the bedsheet on the only bed unruffled. One duffel bag on the ground.

"Where is your brother?" Cas frowns.

"Dean's dead." Sam tells him, plainly.

"What?!" Castiel snaps. "You prayed for me for a possible horn but didn't think of letting me know that Dean's dead?"

Sam looks at him, also frowning. "What's there to pray for if he's already gone?"

Cas opens his mouth, unbelievable, wetting his lips, but not saying anything. He shakes his head, walking several steps away, back towards Sam.

"How?" His voice low and grave.

"Vampires." Sam deadpans. "It's a vampire nest, we went in there too late, Dean killed most of them but got taken down by the largest one. I killed it, after."

"You let Dean go into a vampire nest all by himself? Without backup?" Cas turns around, furious.

"Dean volunteered." Sam says it like it's obvious.

"And why would he do such a stupid thing?" Cas's eyes narrow.

"Because he's a vampire himself."

That is the dropping bomb.

Cas stares at him, eyes so startlingly widened -- if Sam doesn't know better, he'd say Cas almost looks horrified.

And then with a sound of wings flapping, Cas is gone.

Sam goes back to the case.

<br>

Heaven is heavily guarded, nowadays. By Raphael's troops and his loyalists. Cas's army is on the far periphery of the Heaven, still gathering around but far too few in number and in power. Going into the private chamber area where the souls are secured is no less than suicide mission. He goes anyway.

Sneaking into the white corridor reflected by too bright light from all four directions, he looks for the names on the doors. With everyone that has a last name "Winchester", he finds John and Mary, he finds Henry, their distant cousins from other branches, people not related but has the same last name. But there is no Dean. In all the human history with all the human named "Winchester", there is no "Dean" in the Heaven, born 1979, died 2010. Not in John and Mary's chamber, not anywhere.

"What's the matter, lost your little human pet?" A patrol angel notices him, approaching. Raphael's man.

Cas slides his angel blade into grip, ready to fight. The angel throws himself at him, young and unexperienced. Cas throws his blade out, right into his chest. The angel bursts into bright light and lumps into nothing but a pile of vessel.

Cas sighs, eyeing the corridor that doesn't have the person he came looking for, picking up the Blade and rushing to the other side.

More patrols hear the noise, gathering in this direction. He has to leave the place in a rush.

<br>

Crowley is not happy to see him, not at all, to say the least.

"Why are you here again?" He's halfway poking a monster's brain, electrical pod in his gloved hand, blood stains on his apron.

"I need to find the Purgatory. NOW!" Cas sterns.

"Great! That makes the two of us." Crowley makes his voice sound cheerful. "Then why don't you go ahead with your whatever quest and bring me more Alphas, we'll figure that out soon."

Castiel takes two steps ahead, right in front of Crowley, almost nose to nose growling into his face. "You don't understand. Soon is not enough, I need it NOW!"

Crowley eyes him. "What's the rush? Already the check-mate time upstairs?"

Castiel looks away.

"Not the war then." Crowley reads his face. "Then must be the Winchesters. What, they have a sudden interest in the place as well or something?"

Cas shifts uneasily, moving further away, fluttering. "No."

"My my, can't be one of them already gone there, can they?" Crowley makes an exaggerated tsk. "No wonder you can't wait a single second. Always too fond of those two you can't focus on anything now, are you?"

Cas glares at him, snapping. "Yes! Dean's there! Okay? Satisfied?"

The demon hums, almost does sound enjoying himself too much. "All the more reasons to poke around the Alphas, don't you think? Chop, chop, Feathers, don't want to make your boyfriend wait down there for too long."

Cas thins his lips, lines tight. "Do you have more information from your side?" His head tilting towards that little creature Crowley tied to the stretcher.

The demon gives it a shock as he speaks, the monster moans at the electric strike. Crowley listens to the sound like it's music. "Nothing yet. I'll drop a dine when I find anything --"

"Good." Cas cuts. Within a blink, he flies away.

Crowley puffs out a laugh. "Talking about motivations."

<br>

### Chap. 1-2

> **Outline:** Dean fights, tries to come back but can't go through human portal
>
> Cas finds rogue reaper Ajay, tries to go purgatory as angel but fail to leviathans (Naomi: took a lot angels to fetch Cas)

Dean is so tired. His body does not weary, but his mind is way too overloaded.

He doesn't know the days and nights, there is no sun or moon, there is no time. There is just hunting and hunted, chasing and chased, killing and killed.

His mind blurred with the repetition of the same movement -- being attacked from all directions, individually or in group, at once or in turn, then his body goes into autopilot mode to fight. He doesn't even need to think much about any movement, and given time, the monsters would all become a pile of flesh and blood by his feet. Sometimes even himself is surprised that he's the last one left standing. But call it survival instinct or whatever, he's fighting his way out.

There must be a way out. Dean tells himself.

If the past thirty years of living this life teaches him anything, it's the fact that any problem can have a solution. And now he has a problem -- stuck in this monsterland afterlife as a vampire, so he just get to find the solution to leave here and fix himself. And hopefully, fix Sam too.

The last glint of memory flashes by and he sees Sam's face twitching as he was bitten, and later, as he was being killed.

And fix Cas too, now that he really think about it. There is something wrong with Cas too, without seeing him for almost a year, the things he said about not having the luxury of caring about torturing a kid, or caring about anything, it seems. Whatever angel civil war thing that is going on, they'll figure that out too, together. Once he's back.

God, so many problems.

Dean waves the new bone blade he just grabbed from a dead vampire, feeling its weight in his hands, sensing some comfort for having a real weapon finally.

"Okay," He tells himself. "One thing at a time then."

He spots a stream at the edge of the woods, and starts following it, moving downstream.

<br>

As it turns out, if an angel really puts its mind into hunting, they can be a damn good hunter -- the best hunter in the world that a hunter could ever be, actually.

The vicious things give off a dark vibe, not as evil as demons, but also different from the humans. Cas can sense them, pick them out from the crowd like picking out peas from rice. He drags the random werewolves, shapeshifters, vampires, or djinns out of their nest, sometimes he drops them to Crowley's lab, other times he fries their brains out himself when reading their minds.

He doesn't have the luxury of taking things slowly now, he tells himself. Every minute wasted on the Earth, every minute spent talking to a monster when he can just reach inside and read, he thinks of Dean in the Purgatory, being hunted and chased by the millions of monsters in there, he thinks of Dean dead, there, alone, and as a vampire.

Castiel's eyes grow into blue white lights, the two vampires in front of him vaporized. They don't know anything about Purgatory or their Alpha anyway, or if they do, they refuse to give them up. Castiel decides they do not worth his patience.

"I think that's far enough, Angel." A low male voice sounds up behind him.

Castiel turns around, the grace in his eyes barely recedes. He has the angel blade ready.

The man has a strong built, decent suits and outfits, at the first sight he can probably fit perfectly into the upper class, drinking afternoon tea and talking horse racing with the ladies and gentlemen. Except the tea is probably made of human blood. Castiel can see the fang just as he can see the man's skin and clothes.

"Alpha vampire." Cas speaks, almost like a greeting.

"You killed enough of my children." The vampire has a slow almost elegant tone -- the tone of someone who's live for centuries. "I understand you want to schedule an appointment."

"Where is the Purgatory?" Cas asks the only thing he cares about.

"Why would you want to know?" Alpha vampire asks, almost politely.

But Cas's patience is wearing out fast. He takes a few steps closer. "Would you believe if I say it's actually to save a friend? Who gets turned into one of you?"

The thought of Dean being a vampire hurts just as much as knowing he's in the Purgatory. Cas thinks, almost winces by just thinking it, but he makes sure it doesn't show. He shuts that train of thoughts off. They'll figure that out later, once he finds the place and finds him.

"Dean Winchester, is it?" The Alpha studies his face. Cas maintains his expression straight, even if there is any uneasiness of being scrutinized, he makes them blank.

"So you know him." He says as an answer.

"Not just know him, I see through his mind as he sees through mine." The vampire states it factually.

That makes Cas squints. He tilts his head. "What do you mean?"

The Alpha Vampire smiles. "Our minds, think of it as a hive. I can feel all of my children, no matter where they are, and they can feel mine. So when Dean was one of us, he was no exception."

"Was?" Cas can't help noticing.

"Purgatory isn't exactly the signal cover zone, you may say."

Cas swallows, pushing down hard at the thoughts that Dean might be dead that's why the connection breaks, dead even in the afterlife, pushing away the pondering of where he would go next. He doesn't have time for this twisting and sick feeling curling low in his stomach now. He pushes them all down to the bottom.

Cas raises the angel blade higher, more menacingly. "Do you know how to get there?"

"I might." The vampire says, unshifted by the look in Cas's eyes or his blade, knowing far too well about how negotiation or leverage usually work.

"And?" Cas tries hard not to sound too desperate but fails.

"And while I can't take you there personally, I know someone who can. It's no problem." The vampire looks at him in the eyes, grinning wider. "Now, shall we talk terms?"

It is not a good deal, technically. Cas knows it far too clear, so does the Alpha Vampire. But he gets what needs, so he gives the monster what he asks too -- not to hurt any other vampires like he did before, to exchange for a name that hopefully is a real deal and knows the pathway to the Purgatory.

Cas gives him his words. "But I can't promise other hunters would do the same, the vampires would still get killed."

The Alpha shrugs. "A few of you kill some of us, some of my children feed on a few of humans, that's called balance. That's nature. Only what you were doing, wiping out the board to get to me, that's something I can't allow. I have to protect my children, that you must understand."

Cas nods at that.

They part ways.

<br>

The taxi driver is sitting in the driver's seat of a yellow cab, reading a newspaper, at a back alley in Warsaw, Missouri. Cas knocks at the window.

"Ajay?"

The man looks at him. "You know my name."

"And what you do." Cas gives him a look.

"What, you want a ride?" Ajay glances back, hinting at the "taxi" sign on top of the vehicle.

"A ride, yes, but going down." Cas says. "To Purgatory. I know reapers have way, and rogue ones do that for a profit. Like you."

Ajay steps out of the car, looking him up and down. "And why would an angel want to go to the Purgatory?"

"That is my business." Cas states, blankly.

Ajay shrugs. "Sure, and if you get killed down there, also not my business. Not exactly having an insurance around here."

Cas says, "I understand. One ticket down, two tickets up. How does that work?"

Ajay raises his brow. "I didn't say I'd do that yet. What's your payment?"

Cas frowns. "What do you want?"

The rogue reaper curls his lips. "A little fuel in stock would be nice, just in case some days I need it, as good as human souls."

Cas glares at him. "You want my grace?"

"Not all of them, just a tiny bit, you'll grow back, don't you?" The slimy reaper magics a glass vial in his palm, holding straight. "So do we have a deal?"

It's not a large vial, to be honest, but still, losing grace -- trading it -- is unholy. There are so many spells others can do with that bit of grace he gives away to hurt him, or even kill him. And if Ajay is corrupted by Raphael and it's his way of getting to him, then...

But Dean is waiting. Cas's mental image shifts. Dean has been in the Purgatory for so long, and if he doesn't get to him soon, if he's too late then... the death in the afterlife, would that mean forever gone?

Cas grabs the vial and uses the angel blade to cut his left forearm. The sparkling light of grace flow out of the wound, filling into the small glass container. Cas's human body inhales in the pain from the cut. He covers the wound with the other palm, the wound is healed when he removes the palm, but the loss of grace still makes him stumble slightly, as if the legs can't exactly hold his whole body's weight for a moment, or the head becomes too heavy and dizzy.

He hands the vial back, ignoring the uncomfortable feeling.

"Lead the way." He tells him.

<br>

The end of stream leads to an opening. The woods are sparse. The water looks clean.

Dean drops to his knees to scoop up some of the clear liquid to drink. The coolness washes down the dirt in his gullet, he breathes easier. He washes his face and hands too, but doesn't bother cleaning all the other blood stains on his cloth or skin.

In the reflection, Dean sees a face he can barely recognize, with the stubble covering his jaw, the dark bag around his eyes, bruises and cuts here and there. And the fangs, the ugly uneven fangs pointing out, visible whenever he opens the mouth, refusing to contract however hard he demands his body to. Dean claps on the surface to break the image, to not have to look at that face again.

He leaves the water side, heading towards the middle of the opening where, according to some of the old creatures he killed earlier, there would sometimes be some disturbance of air flow, no one in here knows where the stir comes from, but if Dean has to guess, this is where the vail is the weakest.

If long shot is all he can get then Dean would take it. He walks towards the said position. Waving his blade at the nothingness in the air, observing, thinking, waiting. The air is unmoved, but his gut is giving him a drag, hair on the back of his head straighten up, expecting something or someone approaching.

Dean stares at the middle of the ground hard, blade in hand, counting his own bumping heartbeat. Waiting.

<br>

The back alley where the taxi is parked is connected right to a small opening surrounded by four painted walls. The drawings are wild and over colorful, dizzying and frantic. Looking at them for too long might make one's head ache if they are human. Cas looks at them for a moment and then looks away.

"You'll have thirty minutes. I'll see you where I drop you. Don't miss the ride, alright?" Ajay gives him a sly grin, starting the ritual without waiting for an answer.

The air swirls, sands and dirt rise from the ground, creating a small sandstorm. In front of him, the wall painting comes alive, opening up and swallowing him in.

The next blink, the surrounding shifts. The walls and streets disappear into bleak woods and grey sky. Monster growl in the distance. Except --

It's not really in the distance.

Black smoke dropping to the ground around him like debris of an asteroid crashing onto a planet. Creatures with no face but all teeth emerges from the smoke, surrounding him and shrinking the circle.

"What?--" That is the only syllable Cas can make before the attacking begins.

They are fast, and strong. So strong even as an angel he can't compete their strength. Cas is thrown into the air by this one and that, sharp black teeth sinking into his flesh. He does not know if it's his vessel or his grace that is being devoured. He screams in pain and feels strength losing quick.

"We are Leviathans." One of them enjoy too much in its feast on him they actually bother answering his question.

Castiel gasps in disbelief. The prebiblical monster that would devour every living thing that ever exists, devour the whole planet and world if given the chance, God has to create the whole Purgatory to lock them away. He has heard of them like a story baby angels would heard from guardian angels as a bedside story. And now, he's in the middle of their dinner table.

For a split of second, Cas thinks this might be his way of dying -- his true and final death. Becoming shared food of the Leviathans, without having a chance of finding Dean or saving him from this place. His internal twists. Cas focuses all his attention on the scrape of grace he still have left, trying -- thinking -- about exploding himself one last time just to get rid of these filthy creatures that live in the same dimension as Dean. That is when he feels the grips and teeth on his body loosens.

Flashes of a blade shines in front him, the teethy head flying up before dropping to the ground, rolling a few steps away, leaving black liquid mark in its trace.

Castiel drags himself up, looking at the figure fighting the creatures that are now starting to surround --

"Dean!" He cries out his name.

"Cas?" Dean answers automatically, looking in his direction, over joyfully, eyes sparkling.

But just that blinks of distraction leaves enough of a fatal gap, the Leviathan he was fighting with gets the jump on him, the three layers of teeth opening up, angling itself to bite on Dean's shoulder. Dean is pinned to the ground, immobilized.

"NO!!" Castiel rages, eyes blaring bright. "Close your eyes!" He manages to shout at the last moment, can't see if Dean has covered his eyes or not, pouring his power onto that Leviathan that is going to hurt Dean. Castiel can't think or see anything else.

When the light is out, Dean pants. The Leviathans are still there, even more than before. The one baring Cas's angelic power backs off a few steps, but it doesn't seem to hurt, not fatally anyway. It widens the ugly mouth, laughing. It's voice as sharp as its teeth, and it says, smirkingly, "Rock beats scissor, Leviathans beat angel."

There is no way they can win them, no way to even get a head start to run away from them long enough to reach back to the ride the rogue reaper promised.

"Dean!" Cas is desperate, don't even have time to check if Dean is hurt. His vision blocked by more apparently irritated Leviathans attracted from the light show. There is no way he can make it out alive, but Dean, if Dean can make it to the rendezvous point, then maybe --

"Dean! You have to go! I'll distract them! The -- the ride is coming soon --" The attacks already restart, the angel blade is doing very little, more teeth and black goo sinking into his flesh and bones, he screams in his true voice.

<br>

The yell of pain is the first thing that catches Dean's attention. The familiar trench coat the second.

The black smoke turns into monsters he's never seen before, all teeth no face, the ugliest thing one can ever imagine. But luckily, it seems beheading can do the charm, just like all the other creatures in this place -- at least temporarily.

Cutting his way through the surrounding circle, he sees Cas. Being tearing apart alive. Blood and grace floating from the wounds, he can't even tell what's the vessel and what's the angel.

Cas.

For that blink of time, emotions pour into him so quick Dean's almost dizzy with feelings, his steps stumble for the briefest instant, then immediately aiming the blade towards the closest uglyass thing.

Adrenaline pumping in his temple, blade raising and falling, heads falling, black blood spluttering, it almost becomes mechanic.

"Cas." Dean breathes out the name, looking him up and down, overturned by the joy of seeing him. But there is no time for catching up, no time for a single word to say how extremely brightened up he is to see him, but also how pissed he is that these uglyass things seem only appear when he appears and now they seem to be in a bigger trouble than handling wolves and vamps.

When he is pinned to the ground, watching the black goo dripping onto his face and teeth of the monster ready to take a bite on him, with the last bit of strength, Dean throws the last glimpse at Cas, who actually seems okay and meets him in the eyes. Despite the new wounds and cuts on the face and body, he can still straighten up and walk over, looking alive and concerned. Cas is okay. Dean tries to pull a smile at him, only to see his eyes filled with the familiar bright color. He shuts his eyes off. The pressure on top of him releases.

But it is not over. The monsters back away, but they do not leave. Immune to angel power even, if he has to guess. They took the hit like a bear to a rock thrown onto its head.

Circling around them only to look for the next opportunity to attack. There is no way the both of them can get out of here alive. And he's not going to let Cas "be the distraction" as he said.

The air in the opening brightens up not too far away from them. Even closer to the full circle of the Leviathans.

"Dean! You HAVE to go now!" Cas's voice is mixed with the shrieking high pitch of unrecognizable frequency and human words.

"I'm not leaving without you!" Dean shouts back, fighting his way towards the angel.

The blade cuts through the monsters, leaving bodies tumbling around them. The one that still has its teeth on Cas's leg, Dean makes sure it gets chopped into even smaller pieces, kicking its body far sideways.

"Come on! I got you!" He drags Cas up, holding his arms on his shoulder, rushing towards the lighted exit.

And then he stumbles, feeling the pull on his own legs, a monster is dragging him back. Dean loses balance and drops to the ground, but they're so close now. Within two steps to the exit at most, he shoves Cas forward.

"You go ahead and you take care of Sammy for me." He yells.

"No, Dean!" That is the last of Cas's voice he catches before the lights are out. No more exits.

He lets out a long breath. At least one of them are out.

Turning over to face the monsters on his tail, Dean raises his bone blade that is as long and sharp as their teeth.

Dean creeps a smile. "Game time?"

<br>

### Chap. 2

> **Outline:** Cas turns himself to monster (disturbing form, distorted wings etc.), challenges Raphael with death wish, gets killed as he wants, goes to purgatory, finds Dean. Both not recognize the other at first, fight, almost kill each other
>
> (Cas finds out Sam's soulless)
>
> (Ajay is killed by Crowley/Alpha/Raphael, so no going from that again)

Castiel tumbles onto the cement ground, the body crashing onto the solidity of the real world. His mind takes a second to register.

He looks behind him instantly. But there is just the air, the wall, the empty surrounding.

No tree, no monster, no Dean.

"No, no, no, no, no!" He jumps to his feet, fists punching the colorfully painted wall, as if it can tear apart the brick to find the opening again. As if Dean is right on the other side of the wall.

"You have to take me back again, Ajay!" He calls out behind him.

"I don't think Ajay can take you anywhere now." The voice makes his blood cold. Castiel turns around, realizing the whole place's air is buzzing with archangel's angelic power. The lights over head blinking and blow up.

"Raphael." He turns around, back pressed on the wall. Caged.

Raphael is in a female vessel this time, the woman body is a few inches shorter than him. But the true form behind that vessel's face is still gigantic and dazzling bright.

Cas reaches to his inside, testing his grace. The fuel in tank so low that he can barely feel them, flowing sluggishly like the last drop of water in a bottle. He knows he has zero chance this time.

Raphael steps towards him, looking up at his face. The vial with his essence that he gave Ajay not long ago swirls inside the glass, soft and bright. The rogue reaper's body is limp by his cab on the ground, eyes burned out. Two other angels stand by the body.

"You killed him." Castiel shifts his eyes from the body back to the archangel, thinking hard, buying time.

"Thanks to you." Raphael shakes the vial slow, the grace inside there turns faster like a tiny whirlpool. "It's beyond stupid even for you, Castiel. I'm disappointed, actually. I wasn't expecting you to be so... reckless. But in the end, dare to fight against me already tells that."

The human heart bumps hard and fast inside his chest. Is he human enough now for the spell to work? Cas feels the throbbing pain in the tears on his legs and over the whole body, wetness dripping from the wound. He takes the bet. The angel blade sliding into his palm behind his back.

"What are you going to do to me?" He looks at the archangel, questioning, not letting his eyes blink, not showing any fear that the other might be looking for.

"Kill you, of course." Raphael is only two steps away now. "I don't see God or Balthazar or any of the Winchester boys helping you this time."

Cas swallows, reflectively, at the bare mention of the word "Winchester", thought drifting away at the echo of yell Dean threw at him right before he pushed him out, letting himself be pulled away by the monsters. Oh God. He winces.

Raphael must notice that. The female face shows a slight hint of joy. "Feeling the fear now, finally? A little too late for that." The archangel raises his blade. "Good bye, Castiel."

Cas ducks aside, showing the angel banishing sigil he was drawing on the wall with his own blood. Palm pressed on the center of the sigil, it brightens up, blasting Raphael and two other of his followers away. The blast gives himself a small heated burn on the side of the body that is closest to the wall, but that is all that does.

The small alley returns to the dark and silence, hopefully no human poking their head out from their window to witness any of it. Castiel leans back to the bloody wall, rubbing at his own eyes, ignoring the dripping blood from the sliced palm.

Dean is still Purgatory, he is exhausted and low in grace, the only being that can smuggle him to the Purgatory is dead. He needs a plan, but he can't think of one.

Castiel opens his eyes, looking up at the sky that is darkening slowly as the night falls, desperate. Dean would know what to do if he was here, he always can think of something. A next step, a joke to cheer up, an idea, something.

What would Dean do?

Castiel asks himself, and he gets an idea.

<br>

Cas appears in the middle of Bobby's living room. Bobby jumps, almost shot him with the gun by his hand. And Sam actually did, far across the room from the couch. The bullet pierces through his shoulder, flying out from the other side, sinking into the wall on the other side.

"Sam?!" Cas gasps in pain, staggering two steps back by the impact. Blood streaming down from the new wound.

Bobby rushes to him.

"Sorry, panicked." Sam says, slightly apologetically, stuffing the gun back into belt.

"You need to wear a bell next time." Bobby is in front of him now, eyeing the wound that is making his coat a mess. Looking back into his eyes, Bobby's frowns deepens, "Why ain't it healed already?"

Cas presses a palm on the new wound, vainly trying to stopping the pained sensation but it's doing nothing. More exhausted than before, he starts to think it might be a bad idea to come here. "My grace, I'm drained." He tells them.

"You were in a fight?" Sam asks him.

"Not just any fight."

He tells them about the Purgatory, and Ajay, and Raphael, manages to leave out the piece with the Alpha and Crowley though. Bobby wraps his shoulder and some obvious wounds on the legs in some bandage and he says thank you.

"Wow." Sam blinks at the eventful afternoon.

"I know." Cas looks down, sitting down on the chair by the diner table, resting the wounded arm on the armrest.

"No, I mean, you actually went to Purgatory to look for Dean?" Sam looks amazed. "Not even I would think of something like that. I don't think anyone ever would or had."

"Well, maybe you should!" Cas stares at him. "He's your brother, and he needs our help."

Looking closer, he squints, remembering Dean's yell again. He faces Sam, "What happened to you? You used to care about Dean a lot more."

Sam shrugs. "Nothing." Then, he returns the stare, throwing it back. "What happened to you, Cas? You used to care about Dean a lot less."

Castiel looks away, eyes lingering on the window half covered by the flowing curtain. It's all dark outside now. Is the Purgatory darker in the night or would the sky there remain the same lifeless bleach and grey forever?

"Seems like you two just balanced out then." Bobby comments behind them. Sam huffs a laugh, Cas does not.

"I just want to fix this." He says, quieter. He didn't tell them every single detail about the monsters and Leviathans, and how Dean looks like during that brief moment they met down there. The eyes flashed with relief and shortly covered by anger again. He chews on the image and the look.

"What happened to 'The dead should stay dead' and not upsetting the natural order?" Sam raises his brows.

Cas drags his thought back, feeling the bone-deep exhaustion and pained sensation all over him that is dumbing but spreading, sprawling on every inch of his muscle and skin. Does human always feel like this when they are hurt? Does Dean?

"It's... he's just in another place. We can still bring him back." This is what Cas manages to land on. Not exactly an answer, but hopefully it's enough.

"Listen, Angel, I want Dean back as much as you do," Bobby chimes in. "But how? You said yourself, there is no elevator going down there and no more taxi driver to help, any genius idea now?"

"I was hoping to find some answer here." Cas looks at the old hunter, pointedly.

Bobby blinks. "I ain't get nothing."

Castiel nods at the mountainous books on the floor and on the shelves. "Your books might."

<br>

Cas pauses on a page, reading it over, and rereading it. Thinking hard.

He stands up and walks towards the cabinet where Bobby keeps most of his spell ingredients. The other two men look up from their books.

"Find anything you want to share with the class?" Bobby's eyes follow his steps.

Cas's steps are still stumbling, the bandage that covers the hole on the calf leaks hints of black, the one on his shoulder red. He reaches the top level with the uninjured hand.

Bobby grabs the book that he was reading. Castiel already knows what he's going to hear.

"You can't possibly think about doing THAT?!" Bobby snaps, passing the book to Sam.

"Figured you'd say that." Cas doesn't stop the movement, answering without looking back at him.

"Cas, come on, there gotta be another way."

"What if there is no other way?" Cas puts the myrrh and salvia into a pot, starts grinding them, face calm the first time since he entered the room. Eyes focused. "What if we wait for too long to look for a different solution only to be too late for Dean?"

"You don't know what the spell would do to you!" Bobby tries again.

At that, Cas looks up. "Well, technically, we do. It would turn me into a monster. Because that's the point, isn't it? Only the monster could go to the Purgatory, so it makes sense if I become a monster, then I can go and find Dean."

"After you are dead!" Bobby walks over, puts his hands on Cas's grinder, stopping him for a moment. "Godammit, can you stop and think for a second? Do you think Dean would want that?"

Cas stares back. "I don't know! I don't know what Dean would want because he's not here! Why don't you let me do this so I can ask him myself?"

Bobby loosens the grip but snaps with more exhaustion. "How on earth did Winchesters get that problem infected to you too? Just can't wait to sacrifice yourself for one another, you're just like their third brother now, you know that?"

Cas doesn't answer. But Sam does, "For the record, I think it's a good plan, reasonably speaking."

Bobby turns the stare to him, unbelievable. "Great, that makes me the weird one in the room. I'm gonna get whiskey then. You two knock yourself out doing... whatever you want to do, why do I bother saving your asses."

He leaves the room, heading for the kitchen, probably.

<br>

The three main ingredients on the list: demon blood, monster blood, and unholy man's blood -- the mixed blood that is so blasphemous that can turn an angel to a monster.

Cas goes to fetch demon blood and monster blood, Sam says he'd take care of the last one.

They meet back at Bobby's in a few hours, each have jars of blood in hands. Bobby eyes them, both more bloodier than before heading out.

"Do I even want to know how did you get that human blood?" Bobby glances at Sam but looks away shortly.

"Probably not." Sam says, too easily.

Cas frowns. "Did you kill a man?"

Sam just hands him the jar. "Like I said, you probably don't want to know."

"But I do, Sam." *You go ahead and you take care of Sammy for me.* Cas closes his eyes for a brief moment, opens it again, looking at Sam in his eyes. "Who is it?"

"Some priest in the jail, I don't know, sexual assault or something, figured that should be unholy enough." Sam breaks the look, walking further away, sitting down on the couch. "There, happy?"

"No." Cas follows him, frowning deeper. "What happened to you?"

"I don't know! I swear to God if anyone ask me that again I'm gonna punch them in the face." Sam gnaws.

*You go ahead and you take care of Sammy for me.* These are not Dean's last words, Castiel has to remind himself, Dean's not dead, he's just... in a different place. But still, it does feel deeply utterly like some will.

Cas swallows. If Dean's here, he'd want him figuring out what's wrong with Sam and help him. Take care of him like Dean would.

"I'm doing this for Dean." Castiel tells him, right before he poking an arm into Sam's chest, searching for a soul, but only find a vast blank cavity where the soul should be.

Sam screams in agony, Cas has to shove down the feeling again, some ponderings of if it is his fault, some impressions of it is a problem that he needs to fix. He stops that train of thought again, redirecting them back to the bleak trees and sky and Dean running in between, blade in hands, Leviathans not far behind.

One problem at a time.











### Chap. 3

> **Outline:** Dean&Cas recognize each other because of slipping habits/catch phrase that's too familiar (e.g. "son of a bitch"). Cas confesses all secrets he's hiding this year, Dean gets pissed, decides to go back outside first together

### Chap. 4

> **Outline:** Cas sees leviathans and everything, only way out is he juice up, so in order to bring Dean back, Cas absorbs souls in purgatory (tries best to avoid leviathans so stay sane mostly), blows up a hole in purgatory to push Dean out (heal him too, transform back to human again), tries to stay behind to keep everything in purgatory not escape by using his body as patch to the hole (and guilty for leaving Sam's soul behind, self-punish)

### Chap. 5

> **Outline:** Dean insists him out too or else he'll jump back in & they'll help fix Cas's leviathan problem, Cas complies finally, drooping leviathan ooze occasionally but mostly can hold them back, goes to hell, steals Sam's soul back and fixes him

### Chap. 6

> **Outline:** Cas fights Raphael with his leviathan part ("rock beats scissor, leviathan beats angel"), cancels out both problems (explodes, Dean freaks out, Cas survives), all problems solved, world in peace again
