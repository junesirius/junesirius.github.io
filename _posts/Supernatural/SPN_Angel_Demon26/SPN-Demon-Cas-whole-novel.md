## Draft

### Title

**Stairway to Heaven, Highway to Hell**

Stairway to Heaven: Led Zeppelin song

Highway to Hell: AC/DC song

### Idea

(initial demon!Cas prompt 335+335.5)

maybe because of the S04E01 siege when saving Dean, or other times he has to go to Hell, Cas is affected by something in the Hell, and "all that has been to Hell remains in Hell", he becomes unclean, and his grace fails bit by bit (or quickly), and eventually showing demon signs, demon eyes, demon wings, and ultimately turn into a black-eyed demon.

They panic, notice signs and doesn't know what to do. Or could fast-forward/jump start, directly start the story with Cas being a demon, trace back to figure out why or how, and the transformation process that he undertakes alone. Painful, lonely, more self-loath, self-punishment behavior.

But never evil, he's basically still Cas, kinda like Crowley, good-hearted, actually doesn't have much change all things considered, except for the black eyes. At most a bit more mischievous and very slightly moral ambiguous. (Meg is a decent, good-hearted demon too later. Kinda like later season Meg. could add a little Meg/Crowley teasing Cas? teach him how to be demon, what to watch out, salt/iron/holy water) He even still has wings, or even fixed his broken wings (if it's post-S8 divergent), but he knows the white feathers are black now. He's utterly disgusted by his own wings, his own everything. Might even has some suicidal attempt, but stopped by Dean at last moment, or those attempts fail to kill him, or he does succeed and Dean has to go looking for him and resurrecting him from Empty. He has to continue exist as demon.

(somewhat like Ma'lak Box MoC!Cas → prompt 335.5)

Maybe the "not evil" part is only the beginning, when Cas still can have enough self-control, have consciousness, have good-heart, but it's a losing battle. The change is still happening underway, making his heart more black, hard, cold-blooded, blood-thirsty, brutal, cruel, by each day. They notice it, try hard to keep Cas on human/angel good side, reason with him to see the good choice, be good, be kind. Because if Cas loses it, he'd fully, completely, irreversibly become a demon. Maybe they find some solution, but it's like newly-turned vampire/werewolf reverse spell, it would only work if he doesn't cross some last line. Cas is losing control and painful, and Dean/everyone is trying their best to help him.

And maybe Cas still loses it, or something really bad happened. Maybe he attacks Dean with his demon-controlled darkened mind, remembering the harm and pain Dean does to him. Cas accuses Dean, Dean is too guilty to resist, and Cas (accidentally or forcefully?) kills Dean (≈ "Into the Fire" MoC!Dean, kills Cas when controlled, heavy angst). Cas comes back to himself briefly and pains too much, and turns completely to a demon in his heartbroken moment.

have to figure out a way to turn Cas back and save Dean again, maybe Cas doesn't care anything anymore and goes to Heaven to find Dean, which should burn him alive and kill him (which he doesn't mind and thinks he actually deserves it), which end up purifying him and cure him. And the solution is basically because of the love he has for Dean is too strong, demonization process is stripping out the emotions, but love is not an emotion, not just a thread of feeling, it's everything, it's integrated into him, so strong and focused and pure that it becomes the spark that weave the rest of his consciousness back and gets rid of the demonness. So it's not Heaven that purifies the demon, it's seeing Dean when he's in Heaven and the willingness to self-sacrifice for him that heals/reverse-changes him.

The two of them go back to Earth together again. HE.



the whole "turning to demon" is because of MoC, Cas died when he still has MoC and resurrected by Mark and becomes a demon

somewhere in the process there must be one plot he beats the shit out of Dean and almost kills Dean, just for the S10E22's sake

one solution to help him stay human, similar to demon trial Crowley, human blood can purify demon, so Dean tries to purify demon!Cas with his blood, making Cas very openly addicted to Dean's blood and express love

some talk about putting him to Ma'lak Box, divergent from S15E09 monster ending because Dean doesn't put Cas into Ma'lak Box, they won't end up becoming vampires, MoC!Cas help smite so many monsters, he's more powerful/strong than usual (similar to S05E04 Dean seeing the AU ending if he doesn't say yes to Michael, the world becomes that, but his takeaway is to not distance Sam; so S15E09 Sam's takeaway from the AU ending, is they don't put Cas into Ma'lak Box, they'll help him, they can win this monster ending, at least die trying)

to release the Mark Dean has to do the spell and kill Cas, what if the timing is off, they rely on Mark to resurrect Cas then to remove Mark

potential solution: split and transfer the Mark to all living souls, the whole human race everyone takes a piece to lock God away, maybe be a little darker and living longer (still morally ambiguous? not all human sign up for this, they're playing God to make the decision for whole human race, distain the whole human race basically, and they don't know it would work before they try, too much risk, they might end up killing all humans, but the alternative is all monster killing all human, practically the same risk; need to think if there's a better solution)

### Outline

(mimic *The last of Us* title caption style, using day count to note changes, matching dates on Chuck's watch)

#### Day 1 (01/16/2020)

S15E09 Chuck shows Sam the monster ending, Dean/Cas show up with the orb. Sam doesn't lose hope, breaks the orb, locks Chuck up, Cas gets MoC, they officially start move toward the other monster ending's alter timeline.

They go back bunker, Dean asks what Chuck shows him, Sam explains a bit (or in detail), Dean asks why he remains hopeful and decides to still lock Chuck up (even with that horrible ending for them, both having chills, but not any worse than S05E04): similar to S05E04 Dean seeing the endverse ending if he doesn't say yes to Michael what the world would become, but his takeaway is to not distant Sam; so here S15E09 Sam's takeaway from the monster ending is, they don't put Cas into Ma'lak Box, they'll help him, they can win this monster ending (at least die trying)

Dean/Sam watch/observe Cas carefully, very cautiously tip-toe around him. Cas gets more self-conscious, snaps, already starts showing more grumpy and more tend to argue/retort/right. Dean notices/points out, Cas falls quiet. (slight unpleasant parting, each go back to own room; Dean might worry Cas would leave bunker, glad Cas just goes sulk in his room)

#### Day 11 (01/26/2020)

(case fics, could be short highlighted, summarized. Cas might help with the cases, but at a cost of huge collateral damage due to his decisions. Dean tries to steer Cas back to doing right thing.)

(Cas's MoC symptom: have sudden flashbacks/visions; more violent, more grumpy)

Cas's grace distained by MoC bit by bit, going dark/crazy day by day (currently the change is still small), but already starts showing worse temper, uneasy to stay in bunker with them, fights with Dean/Sam more, more fidgety, wants to take action/move/kill, more unlike old Cas by each day, attempts to leave bunker

Dean/Sam slight panic/huge worry about him, keep close eyes on him, not sure what to do. Dean follows him around a bit (too much), mother-hens, tries to make sure Cas's okay; Cas snaps at him, annoyed; Dean is taken aback, Cas apologizes.

Cas finds a case, missing people in Florida (canon alligator case changed). They go hunting, find five Wendigos (hint abnormal monster number), Dean spends time fighting them, Cas seems to enjoy the physical fight a little too much, getting himself all bloody and physical before smiting all of them, heals Dean/Sam. Dean suspects why he's enjoying the fight, Cas denies. Victims alive in the nest, one of them gets eyes burned out by the smiting grace (not shut in time, scream in pain), Cas heals the rest (only very slightly bothered, almost unbothered), Dean/Sam notices, more worried.

Back to bunker, Sam secretly examines Ma'lak Box in the middle of night (or just hangs around there pondering), has quiet argument with Dean, overheard by Cas. Cas misunderstands they'd still want to lock him away, not trust him, storms out; Dean goes to catch him. some bad-tempered trust-issue-related fight.

Dean manages to coo Cas, calms him down, leads him back to bunker. Physical touch helps, it sooths Cas more. They talk about how it feels to bear MoC, Dean understands and remembers, knows how difficult it is, Cas tells it's like a constant pull at the back of head and the skin is humming with energy (he doesn't feel this much power since godstiel time, it scares him). Dean understands and calms him, good quiet bonding moment.

#### Day 93 (04/17/2020)

(The day Claire would have been killed by vampires)

Jody calls about vampire nest. Cas goes to help hunt with Dean/Cas. So many more vampires, Jody/Claire arm to the teeth, still all of them overwhelmed, Claire almost died. Cas rages, blows the whole building/area flat (overreact), takes everyone out, heals Claire. Claire is a bit spooked by unusually furious Cas, notices something off. Dean talks privately with Claire, covers for Cas. Dean talks with Sam, shares concern. Dean talks with Cas, caring, worried, wants to know how it's progressing.

Cas is seeing bloody violent visions. Some bad bloody memories, some haven't happened, some people die. Cas sees himself kill Dean. Cas is spooked around Dean, keeping distance with Dean, scared he'd hurt him. Dean tries to comfort him (shared memory again).

#### Day 126 (05/20/2020)

(The same day in 2014 is S09E23 MoC Dean dies and becomes demon Dean)

Cas sees flashback of Michael hurting/forcing/menacing John/Dean back in S4/5, Michael refusing to help them fight Chuck in S15. Cas thinks/hopes Michael might know how to release his bloodthirst feeling.

Cas finds Michael, locates him (location is on his laptop/map/phone, or phone is tracked by Dean later; in Church, St. Michael), leaves bunker to go to Michael alone. Their talk turn into heated argument, Cas starts getting controlled/overwhelmed by MoC, holds grudge it's Michael's fault he's like this now (Michael can see his physical/angelic form changing too, mention it to him), gets violent, starts attacking Michael. Michael self-defenses, or getting impatient, or it's accident, or Cas threatens/kills Adam when Adam switches out to try to talk him down. (Michael still has grudge to Cas too, ass-butts and Molotovs him and leaves him in Cage for ten earth-years.) Michael rages (or accident), his archangel blade stabs Cas, kills him.

Dean just gets to the spot right on time to see Cas is killed by the blade. Torched wingspan on church ground.

Dean enters mourning mode, demands/pleads Michael to bring Cas back. Sam remembers one can't be killed if they bear MoC (Michael doesn't know)

Dean hopeful, all waiting. Cas's eyes snap open, black demon eyes.

#### Day 127 (05/21/2020)

(next day)

Cas opens demon eyes, makes demon growling sound, looks at them one by one, stares at Dean, then flies away.

Dean panics, tries to deny, makes random theories. Michael can see the celestial/non-vessel change, tells them MoC brings Cas back alive and confirms it turned Cas to a demon (demon wings, demon eyes, the transformation process is still in progress, Cas must be not want to be seen like that so he flies away, but he's getting dangerous)

(from now on below, Cas is a demon with MoC. turning a bit darker, a bit more mischievous/sour/bitter/sarcastic, a bit more morally ambiguous. Cas needs to learn how to live as a demon, vulnerable to salt/iron/holy water/demon trap)

Dean tries to pray and phone call Cas, Cas doesn't reply or come back. Dean worries. They go back bunker.

(Cas can't hear Dean's prayer now because he's not angel anymore, explain later)

(some Cas POV to show the damage he did? the pain he's in realizing he's a demon now? fallen demon wing shatters in the places he's been?)

(can morph/combine a bit from the next chapter about Dean's searching if this chapter getting too short)

#### Day 171 (07/04/2020)

(Six weeks and two days later, same duration as S12E09 Dean is gone and Cas can't find him; Independence Day)

Dean finds evidences that monsters are being killed all over the country, with sulfur traces with them. Almost always have casualty or victim on site. Demons and ghosts are being killed too. (some conversation between Dean/Sam, talking about the time when Dean was a demon with Crowley; Dean hopes demon Cas can do better than him, but still too worried, a bit mourning widower state of mind too)

Dean/Sam use spell to go to Hell (like S15E08 they just came back from there, or phone call? "You know you can just call me" number 666) to ask if Rowena can locate Cas (now that he's a demon, but Cas is not in her charge). Rowena uses tracking spell to locate Cas (like S13E20 tracking Gabriel, taste like haggis, can be sensed if powerful).

Dean/Sam goes to the location Rowena gave them, still too late, monster there is already killed, remaining trace of sulfur. (demon hunter, like S06E20 deja vu)

Dean/Sam go home miserably, thinking they'd never catch up with Cas again, surprisingly find Cas outside of bunker.

#### Day 172 (07/05/2020)

(next day)

Dean powers down bunker's demon-proof defense system to let Cas in. Cas comes back because he senses Rowena's tracking spell on him, knowing it must be Dean/Sam looking for him.

Sam scares of Cas's demon eye. Dean fears him too but talks to him, wants him stay. Cas is in demon mindset, wants to kill them (like S10E03 Dean, a bit *Shining* horror moment), very cold-blooded, murderous, blaming them for past mistakes and suffers (changed dramatically over the unseen six weeks). Dean guilty but determined to save him, strategically leads him to demon trap in dungeon, traps him there, ties him up. Sam helps too, the scare was half performance to let Cas's guard down against him.

Dean injects Cas with his blessed human blood (like S08E23/S10E03 hell trial 3, using human blood to cure/purify demon). Cas is in pain during the transition, boiling, screaming. Dean apologizes and in pain while continues to do that, tears when he thinks he could be killing Cas for doing that ("I promised you I won't let you become a monster" "I already am." "No, you're not. You're Cas.")

Cas's demon eye reverse to normal, more back to himself now (first sentence: "Hello, Dean. You look worried.")

Dean asks if he's fully cured/reversed. Cas spreads wings, from the shadow, Dean/Sam can see leathery demonic wings, not fluffy feathery. Cas disgusts of his current wings (but complete, can fly).

Dean sprays him holy water, Cas still gets burned. (Why not fully cured/reversed, just barely help him in control: human blood return human-turned-demon to human, Cas was angel-turned-demon, he'd need angel blood to be cured. The only angel they know is still around is Michael, but Michael's the one killed him, so out of option.)

#### Day 179 (07/12/2020)

(a week later)

Cas promises to behave. Dean/Sam let him out of demon trap in dungeon, still very very cautious. Cas is more sentimental than usual, very emotional (like S09 human-blood-addicted Crowley).

demon!Cas is addicted to Dean's human blood now, getting more clingy, a bit more handsy and sexual. When Cas is overwhelmed by the need of Dean's blood, he get very openly expressive, confesses to Dean he loves him, indicative of doing more between them (like S05E04 drug-high endverse Cas), and injects Dean's blood to get himself sated when he's allowed. (binge-watches chick-flicks in his room?)

Dean in denial of Cas's love confession, says it's demon talking, says Cas isn't himself and it's not real (even if he clings to the touch a bit and closes his eyes, has to pull himself away), a bit jumpy.

Cas upset at the denial, gets even darker when Dean doesn't accept him, demon symptom deteriorates worse, loses control, runs loose, breaks free, out of bunker. big collateral damage along the way, big massacre outside the town, blood-bath (cattle mutilation, remote deserted factory/location explosion → monster/gangster death, a lot of bad guy death, but unsure if deserve it fully; Chicago? Cas alone kills the whole five monster families in Chicago, S09E20)

#### Day 180 (07/13/2020)

(next day)

Dean reads news, goes to Chicago, finds Cas.

Cas is in control of MoC/demon dark side for now when Dean finds him, in one of the bombed site, in the middle of a lot of monster bodies, all torched (Cas doesn't have grace, but still have super demon power, like Crowley). more self-loath, self-disgust, self-punishment, painful, lonely, thinks he doesn't deserve, thinks sure it's why Dean won't ever love him, self-harm, self-hatred, suicidal. ( warning before chapter, heavy angst, bloody and violent and really really bad, suicidal attempts, self-harm)

Cas prepares holy water and angel blade for himself, hesitating only because he doesn't know what would happen after death, if MoC would turn him into something even worse, he can't die, but he can still feel pain. Cas cuts himself on the wings with angel blade (clips black bat-like leathery wings, misses his white feathery wings, ultimate self-loathing), writes farewell letter for Dean (like Dean's suicidal farewell trip in S05E18), very very emotional, but thinks he deserves it, it must be his purpose and final punishment.

Dean arrives right on time when Cas's about to try again to kill himself (or poke his demon eyes out, while stare at mirror, hate his own demon eyes, blood streaming, but self-heals/healed by MoC), Dean stops him, pulls him into a hug. Cas surprised, pulls away, thinks Dean must loath him, but still can't help addicted to Dean's blood. Dean cuts himself and lets Cas drink his blood, to make Cas feel better. Cas drinks and calms down, demon eyes return to normal blue eyes.

Cas is haunted by the vision he'd be the monster that kills Dean/Sam then murders the world (+memory from S08E17+S07E01). Cas begs Dean to lock him into Ma'lak Box before he loses control again, then throws him into Mariana Trench or deepest Hell (he's a demon now, he belongs to Hell anyway, hope Rowena has enough ways to keep him there), he'd do it if he could do it himself, but he needs Dean lock him up from outside.

Dean refuses, no matter what he says. Cas doesn't understand, or thinks he's still worried about Chuck's monster ending, tries to comfort him that he'd already kill most of the monsters in US, the remaining ones should be able to be under control just from hunters' works. Dean resents that he doesn't understand, Dean finally allows himself to love, to accept Cas as is. Dean kisses Cas ("You won't become a monster, because I'll be here.")

(the big argument about putting Cas to Ma'lak Box eased out by the kiss (sex? not yet?) and Dean's confession/insistence; continue to diverge from Chuck's monster timeline, as long as Cas is not in Ma'lak Box)

Dean brings Cas back to bunker.

#### Day 344 (12/24/2020)

(case fic: djinn, to save Eileen; the day Eileen would have been killed; Christmas Eve)

Cas gets stronger/more powerful as demon/MoC affect, goes to hunt monsters with them, smite monsters easily. When Dean's good and kind to him, he's in control, they save people. Dean's very cautious about his own temper now too, becoming more caring and patient (because if Dean loses control, Cas is more easily losing control; Dean self-controlling is also for Cas's sake).

(Cas would still lose control but redirect to monsters, keeping world-wide monster issue under control. but also show very clearly the change is still happening underway, making him more cold-blooded during hunting, blood-thirsty, brutal, cruel, dark. He tries hard to resist and keep control, not affected by visions and voices, but MoC needs to kill, it's a losing battle for him. They all can see it.)

The current case is djinns, Eileen is in danger. They are thrown into different vision. Cas is temporarily hallucinated into the djinn world where he and Dean live a happy peaceful retirement life near beach, Dean has a small bar, Sam goes to live with Eileen and has family. Everyone happy.

Then Cas sees his own demon reflection from djinn world mirror (like S03E10 Dean sees demon!Dean), he loses control, explodes temper/blood-thirst, kills Dean and everyone, the last is kills himself, wakes up, kills all the djinns (overreact explosion again), everyone is saved. Cas is scared again and wants to fly away again.

Dean gives him soft moment again, shows him love, he's okay, he's in control, knows what's right, he's better than MoC, better than MoC!Dean. So Cas does exactly that, keeps himself together. Love is the only strongest thing in Cas that can't be darkened or taken, so Dean keeps doing that. Both of them try very hard to keep Cas on good side, see good/right choices, be good/kind.

Discussion between Dean/Cas about what is love ("If I murder the world, would you still love me?" If yes, then what is it exactly that you're in love with? "You. Just you. All of you.")

#### Day 357 (01/06/2021)

(start more monster-of-the-day cases. This one, case fic: werewolves; the day in monster ending, shown to Sam)

The place is packed with werewolves, the victims are bleeding out. They would have needed to wait, but Cas charges in and kills all the werewolves, big grand fight scene (Dean always amazed when Cas is in big awesome action scene). Cas heals the victims, saves everyone. They burn down all the werewolf bodies and the whole building.

Dean says they wouldn't be able to save any of them if it's not for Cas to be there. Sam recognizes this is exactly one of the timestamps Chuck showed him in the monster ending vision, and they really already changed it, just because Cas is there.

They're sure they're on the right track doing the right thing now, they'll save Cas and the world, everything is going to be fine.

Cas is more fidgety than ever.

At night, Dean/Cas snuggling time, they're getting more intimate (because Cas needs that to remain calm, and Dean's willing to give him anything, practically together now). Cas is more worried, Dean distracts him with more intimate actions, let him not think of the alternatives for now. (insert dream sequence? Cas sleeps but nightmares of the possibilities that he can still ruin everything? to show it's still unsettling.)

#### Day 491 (05/20/2021)

(the date: one year anniversary of Cas reviving as demon)

(more close calls)

Shapeshifter case, with Donna/Jody/Alex/Patience. (the day Donna and the girls would have been killed, make Jody the suicidal version in monster ending)

More than one shapeshifter, change into Dean/Sam/Donna/Jody/girls. Cas gets messed up by the monsters, vision overlaps with reality, sees Dean dead, the shapeshifter!Dean mocks him. Cas turns demon eye. Dean appears, saying he is him; shapeshifter saying the same. Cas can't tell. Dean trusts he can tell, just let him make the decision, but quickly, others are dying and need him to save; shapeshifter is roughly also the same. Cas loses control, very very close to kill the real Dean, real Dean meets his eyes without fear, shapeshifter scares. Cas kills the shapeshifter, Dean is relieved. They help the others, all safe and saved.

Jody sees Cas's demon eyes, Sam explains for Cas, Dean rushes out after Cas trying to leave the scene very quickly. Cas wants Dean to keep distance with him, stay far away from him, he's dangerous, looks at Dean with demon eyes, ashamed of himself. Dean asks instead how did he find out. Cas: "You're never scared of me. Even when I could kill you. I should go. I could kill you." Dean: "I don't care. You're staying."

Dean reminds Cas he was about to kill Sam too when Dean was a demon, and what Cas said then was "Does Sam want a divorce?" "It would take a lot more than trying to kill Sam with a hammer to make him want to walk away." It applies to them now. (joke around "divorce"? "That means we'd have to have a relationship first. Oh God, am I your boyfriend?" → established relationship now?)

#### Day 658 (11/03/2021)

Vampire case, with Dean/Sam. (the day Dean/Sam would have been turned to vampires)

The more Cas uses his demon power the more easily he'd be controlled by demon/MoC dark side (like S4 Sam). They try to limit Cas use power, mostly hunt with knives/blades/guns like normal human hunters (just like Dean/Sam) unless absolutely have to.

A lot of vampires, overwhelm them. Normal knives/blades/guns aren't enough, Dean is pinned down by vampires, almost bitten. Cas has to use demon powers, shows demon eyes (like Crowley with red eyes in S10E22). Most vampires are killed, they let guard down, think it's over, Dean goes to check on Cas, gets jumped by one last surviving vampire, Cas throws himself before Dean, vampire bites Cas, vampire is dead immediately (poisoned by demon blood poison). But vampire venom makes Cas lose control, poisons Cas.

Cas loses control, worse than ever, all demonic side are triggered, completely overwhelmed by dark side. When Dean checks on him, Cas beats Dean up and almost kills Dean (like S10E22 MoC!Dean). Cas remembers/accuses all the harm/pain Dean brings to him, all the times he died for Dean, for once Cas thinks for himself and it's not fair. Dean is too guilty to resist, completely not fight back, just let him beat, just keep saying it's not him, he believes Cas can wake up, "It's me. I need you." Cas cruel: "I know it's you." that's why he'll kill him.

Killer blow. Cas raises blade high, grabs Dean at collar, ready to kill. Dean meets his eyes, actually ready to be killed, bloody and dying, mouthing "It's okay. I love you." Cas ends up resisting the killing instinct, stabs blade on the ground two inches away from Dean's face. "It won't miss next time." Dean is relieved.

Sam jumps in, injects Cas with human blood (Dean's, pre-prepared? Dean wants to use on Cas during fight but can't quite?), mixed with holy water, boiling Cas up from inside, controlling him. Dean: "What are you doing!" Sam: "Save you!" Dean furious: "You're killing him!" Sam: "Or he'll kill you!" Dean ignores that part: "But you're killing him!" Dean pissed at Sam for making Cas in pain. Sam: "Unbelievable. You're welcome." Dean: "I got him!"

#### Day 666 (11/11/2021)

(date: one week later; also for demon number 666)

Dean/Sam bring Cas back to bunker.

Cas in demon cuffs in dungeon inside demon trap, Dean is there with him, physically exhausted and wounded too but doesn't leave. Dean does the blood purification therapy for Cas all over again. The effect is visibly smaller and smaller, Sam: "Resistance?" Dean: "Is that even possible?" Dean wants to increase the dose. But it would literally practically drain his blood, he can't extract any more of his blood. Sam calls in for blood donation help from Jody (in the background). They're not alone in this, Dean isn't the only one trying so hard to save Cas, Jody/Donna/Eileen/Claire all saved by Cas, now willing to save him too.

Cas wake up, dozed on and off from all the human blood injection, floating between in and out of control. Cas regrets he hurts Dean, knows he's losing control, he's gone crazy, no way he'd be able to be sure Dean would be safe near him. Cas tries to persuade Dean again to put him into Ma'lak Box, he loses the battle, Dean/Sam would continue fighting, pretty sure it deviates from Chuck's monster ending long enough, they should be safe now.

Even if it's true, even if it wouldn't go back collide onto Chuck's monster ending, Dean refuses. Dean reminds Cas what Cas said to him in S10E22 when Dean's MoC: "I'm the one who will have to watch you murder the world", now he's doing the same for Cas for as long as he can. Cas: "What would happen to me after you die?" Dean's mortal, it's not going to be forever. For the first time demon/MoC!Cas shows vulnerable, scared, he's scared of getting left behind alone, when no one is going to stop him murder the world, when Dean's not there, died of old age, he'd continue exist with MoC for eternity, not recognizing himself. That's his biggest fear. That's the real reason he'd want to be buried into Ma'lak Box, at least the world would be safe from him.

Dean can only hold him close and tight, repeating they'll work it out. He promises he'll not let Cas be buried or completely gone to dark. They'll work it out. (hopeful, desperate, devastated, actually helpless, he has no idea how to solve this)

#### Day 1059-1 (12/09/2022)

(the day Dean/Sam would have died) (before-chapter warning: heavy angst, temporary MCD, suicidal thoughts)

(demon/MoC!Cas actually kills Dean)

Cas is semi-permanently locked to dungeon demon trap, human blood injection has no affect on him now. Dean's still there with him, just as company, it's their new routine now (been like this for a while). Cas is still pleased to see him there. Dean's reading and finds out Ma'lak Box is more than just a lock, the word and spell means "angel", it's actually angel medical box, anything locked in there maintain its state for as long as eternity, no cell would change, time is frozen in there (like DW Pandorica). But not sure if it's true, the only one knows about it for sure would be Billie.

Dean plans to temporary suicide to go ask Billie to be sure (if it's real, it means immortal for him if he goes in there, the solution for them could be Dean/Cas both get locked inside Ma'lak Box, not lonely, not endangering anyone). Cas doesn't want him to "temporarily die", thinks it's too dangerous, he could really die, or Billie doesn't let him back. They argue, Dean has the syringe, they fight, Cas loses temper, shoves Dean. Dean falls, or Cas just accidentally instinctively attacks, or just somehow holds the syringe and stabs Dean, or to make a point to show if Dean really wants to die, there are easier ways, like Cas can do exactly that if that's what he wants and attacks and stabs him. (S10E14 Cain to MoC!Dean: "Then you'd kill the angel, now that one, that I suspect would hurt something awful" reversed, "Into the Fire" reversed, heavy angst)

Dean is really killed, Cas comes back to himself later, pains/regrets/self-blame too much, heavy angst, heartbroken.

Cas frantically tries to use his power to heal/resurrect Dean but can't.

Sam comes back (temporarily out for a sec to do something mundane? library/grocery) horrified.

Cas breaks demon trap (some spell or raw power to shatter dungeon floor, break the sigil), moves Dean to Ma'lak Box.

Cas goes to Heaven to look for Dean (to apologize/make up/save him), while Sam medically tries to save Dean. (Sam doesn't trust Ma'lak Box's saving power, calls 911, entrusts modern medical)

#### Day 1059-2 (12/09/2022)

Cas doesn't care about anything anymore and goes to Heaven to find Dean (should burn him alive and kill him when he passes the heaven gate portal, which he doesn't mind and thinks he deserves it, end up purifying him, reverts demon!Cas back to angel!Cas, but MoC still there → this revert is basically because his love is too strong, demonization process is stripping out emotions/feelings, but love is not an emotion, not just a thread of feeling, it's everything, it's integrated into him, so strong and focused and pure that it becomes the spark that weave the rest of his consciousness back and gets rid of the demonness. so it's Heaven purifies demon, it's seeing Dean and the willingness to self-sacrifice for him that heal/revert the demon part in him)

When in Heaven Cas sees Dean's heaven version of Cas and the two of them are basically doing same thing when they're on Earth, express love/feeling/hug/kiss, basically the same as before, except Dean seems truly happy/peaceful, not worried. Cas thinks Dean deserves the peace in afterlife, better not disturb him now, but stopped by Dean ("Where do you think you're going"), because Dean can tell the memory!Cas is not real Cas ("I'd rather have you", not perfect, darkened, but real). maybe they never really have sex before (or never penetrated) but here in heaven, for the first time, they do it for real, push one step further in their relationship, Dean reassure Cas he doesn't blame him for killing him, appreciate him coming to Heaven for him. Dean can see Cas's wings for real this time (because they're in Heaven, different dimension, different realm, different physics rule), Cas's wings are feathery again, Dean tells Cas he's beautiful (even with MoC)

while having those moments in heaven, inserts background noise like beeping sounds, Dean realizes it's Sam sending his body to hospital, they're still doing emergency CPR on him, almost claim his death. But they still have a chance of going back if they want. Dean/Cas decide they want to continue a second (huh) chance, so Dean comes back; in hospital, it looks as if it's a electroshock worked, medically resurrected ("Dude you're dead for nine hours" "Nine hours, eighteen minutes", very rare but not impossible, called Lazarus Syndrome, the world record is seventeen hours "Don't encourage him")

"What now, Cas?"

#### Day 1111 (01/30/2023)

(retirement ending)

Like Cain, Cas tames MoC, retires as a bee-keeper (loves honey too), Dean stays there retiring with him. Dean would have been aging but Cas uses his power (limitless now, angelic now, fueled from MoC) to keep Dean young and alive. balance for each other, watch out for each other, live a retired beekeeper domestic life for eternity.

It's like a God guard duty, Cas has been on guard duty watching Earth for millions of years before being charged with humans (Dean/Sam), now just shift to guard the lock to not let God out.

Dean: "I'm with you." "You don't have to." "I want to."

<br>

abandoned other solution/endings (propose as their potential plans to save Cas):

the same spell they use to save Dean (Dean will have to kill Cas to release it, and let MoC resurrect Cas before removing it → what if the timing is off, Cas will be really dead)

split and transfer the MoC for more than one people to bear, Dean shares the Mark with Cas, both grey, but no one black

split and transfer the MoC to all living souls (whole human race, everyone takes a piece to lock God away, this is the day Man defeat God → everyone live a little darker and longer; morally ambiguous proposal, not all human sign up for this, they're playing God to make the decision for whole human race, distain the whole human race, and they don't know it would work before they try, too much risk, they might end up killing all humans, or all humans turn too dark and kill each other (but alternative is Cas kill the world or monster kill the world, the world is doomed anyway, same risk) → "This is nuts" need to think if there's better solution)

monster god ending: Chuck warns them his existence is the only reason why monsters don't overwhelm mankind, meaning it's his credit to keep monster number in control, meaning he'd have to keep working. so Cas has to keep working to smite monsters to keep human safe, he's like Chuck here for the balance, so he'd have to work eternity (but Chuck has been gone for centuries, monsters are in control all the time, earth and human is fine without him, he's a liar; can go back to retirement ending)

retire ending: like Cain, Cas tames MoC, retire as a bee-keeper (loves honey too), Dean be there retire with him. Dean would have been aging but Cas uses his power (limitless now, fueled from MoC, but every time use it he'd be darker) to keep Dean young and alive (or partially as the split solution). balance for each other, live a retired beekeeper domestic life for eternity

##### 01/16/2020 (present time): lock Chuck up

they open the Rift and shut Chuck with MoC

##### 04/17/2020 11:42:02 PM: vampires kill Claire

Sam, Eileen, Dean, Cas are having a relaxed evening in the Bunker, when Jody rings to tell them Claire was killed when they were hunting vampires and there turned out to be more than expected.

> (That man who disappeared in Florida turns out he was eaten by an alligator.)
>
> A bruised and bloody Jody sits behind the wheel (of her truck) -- her arm's injured, but she's made a crude tourniquet. Right now, she's pale -- quiet. Tamping down her anger and grief.
>
> Jody: "It... it was only three vamps. Me, and Claire, we went in armed to the teeth -- but there were more. So many more."
>
> And Jody starts to break down.
>
> Jody: "She's dead. Claire's dead."
>
> 04/17/2020 11:46 PM

##### 01/06/2021 09:09:18 PM: werewolves kill victims, Cas was already locked

Sam and Dean are in the Impala, having just fought a pack of werewolves and failing to save any of the victims. They mention that Cas is gone and Dean muses that the monsters are winning. The scenery that they drive by shows buildings on fire.

> Sam and Dean drive back from a Hunt. They look battered -- fresh bruises mingle with old scars. Dean white-knuckles the wheel, as Sam stares out the window, lost in thought. The car passes some kind of still burning FIRE... the flames' reflections streak across the car. Sam doesn't even flinch.
>
> Dean: "I know what you're thinking, but -- we did everything we could."
>
> Sam: "We could've gone in sooner."
>
> Dean: "Place was crawling with wolves, we <u>had to</u> wait."
>
> Sam: "And the victims died -- bled out on the floor."
>
> Then-- more regretful, almost wishful--
>
> Sam: "Cas were still here, he could've healed them--"
>
> Dean: "Well he's not."
>
> Dean speaks almost emotionlessly-- it's an already old wound.
>
> Sam and Dean both gone quiet -- we can now hear the RADIO, babbling quietly...
>
> Radio Newscaster: "... Pittsburgh has been declared a no-go zone. We spoke with Comptroller Wilkes -- city government's highest-ranking survivor."
>
> Comptroller Wilkes: (voice breaking) "Our once proud city is gone. To my fellow Pittsburghians-- take shelter where you can. And if you see one of those things-- RUN."
>
> Dean shuts the radio off. Sam and Dean are grim.
>
> Dean: "They're winning, Sammy. The monsters are winning."

##### 11/03/2021 11:42:36 AM: Donna, Claire, Eileen were all already dead

Sam and Dean have returned from a vampire hunt, and Sam is keen to head out again. Dean is feeling hopeless -- there are just too many monsters and they aren't even saving people anymore. They mention that after Cas took on the MoC as part of the plot to cage Chuck, he went crazy and had to be locked in a Ma'lak Box. The monsters are everywhere and all their friends are either dead or they've quit hunting, except for Jody and Bobby. Dean suspects that they all carry a death wish: Jody after Donna, Claire, and the other girls were killed; Bobby always had a death wish; and Sam after Eileen was killed.

> Sam arms up, even more battle-scarred than the last time-- almost dead-eyed.
>
> Dean: "What are you doing? We just got back--"
>
> Sam: "We don't act now -- nest'll move on."
>
> Dean: "No. Sam -- I'm worried about you."
>
> Sam: "What are you saying?"
>
> Dean: "What I've been trying to say for months. It's time. To-- stand down."
>
> Sam: "You want to-- quit? What's happened to you, Dean? Ever since--"
>
> Sam stops himself.
>
> Dean: "Ever since, what? Since we've lost just about everybody we care about? Since the Mark drove Cas crazy? Since I had to <u>bury him</u> in a Ma'lak Box, since... (collecting himself) Monsters are everywhere. What we do now isn't even Hunting, it's whack-a-mole-- we don't even <u>save people</u>. Every friend we ever had is either dead-- or they've gotten wise and packed it in."
>
> Sam: "Jody's still fighting. Apocalypse Bobby is too--"
>
> Dean: "He has a death wish. After what happened with Donna and the girls-- Jody does, too. And after Eileen-- <u>so do you</u>."
>
> A beat on Sam, bristling at the diagnosis. Then--
>
> Sam: "So-- what? We spend the rest of our lives in this tomb-- eating canned food and reading old paperbacks til we die? What happened to Butch and Sundance? Going out swinging?"
>
> Dean: "We can't-- we <u>lost</u>, Sam. I'm done."
>
> He moves out of the room, Sam follows--
>
> Sam: "Dean..."

##### 11/03/2021 12:36:38 PM: Sam/Dean get turned into vampires

Sam tells Dean he is heading out on the hunt and Dean resignedly follows him. Chuck comments that Dean should've followed his gut. This is the day they are both turned into vampires.

> Sam: "Well-- I'm raiding that nest-- with or without you."
>
> On Dean-- giving into Sam's nihilism.
>
> Dean: "Then-- guess I don't have much of a choice."
>
> And Dean starts leading Sam out of the bunker--

##### 12/09/2022 03:11:38 AM: Sam/Dean get killed as vampires by Jody/Bobby

Sam and Dean prepare to take a last stand in a hotel room. Two hunters and Jody and Bobby approach. They storm the room -- to kill Sam and Dean who have been turned into vampires. They kill the hunters and Jody manages to shoot Sam with a dead man's blood bullet. Dean bites and kills Jody, and Bobby beheads Sam. The vision ends with Sam's death, leaving Dean and Bobby's ultimate fates unknown.

> We are in a dirty flophouse-- stained mattress on the floor, bare walls. Dean and Sam throw some crates against a door, barricading themselves. They seem grimier, more battle-scarred than before-- but they're keyed up, in high spirits--
>
> Sam: Only way in.
>
> Dean: We'll be ready for 'em.
>
> Sam: We're outnumbered.
>
> Dean: What else is new?
>
> He gives Sam a big, reassuring smile--
>
> Dean: Those bastards take us down-- at least we go down together.
>
> Sam: Butch and Sundance.
>
> Dean: Go out swinging.
>
> Off their oddly joyful nihilism, we BEGIN AN INTERCUT--
>
> FOUR HUNTERS (in post-apocalyptic Hunterwear) charge up the stairs-- JODY and AU!BOBBY among them. They're making their way to Sam and Dean's refuge. As they get closer--
>
> AU!Bobby: Hold up!
>
> AU!Bobby stops Jody-- Jody signals to the others to wait.
>
> AU!Bobby: Sure you're ready for this? (off her look) It's Sam and Dean, Jody.
>
> Jody: No, Bobby-- those things? They ain't our boys.
>
> BACK IN THE FLOPHOUSE-- Sam and Dean share a look-- and FANG OUT! Holy shit-- they're vampires!
>
> As Sam and Dean prepare to fight for their (vampire) lives--
>
> BACK IN THE STAIRWELL-- Jody levels with AU!Bobby.
>
> Jody: We're doing this <u>for</u> Sam and Dean. <u>This</u> is what they would've wanted.
>
> Off AU!Bobby's nod, and Jody's grim resolve--
>
> BACK IN THE FLOPHOUSE-- as Sam and Dean take position. Ready for the coming onslaught. Finally--
>
> THE DOORS BUST OPEN! It's chaos-- four Hunters against Sam and Dean! As Dean and Sam get their hands full with the two REDSHIRTS... making quick work of them--
>
> Jody does a stealthy ROLL across the floor-- finding Sam's flank. She aims at his side with a PISTOL-- FIRES!
>
> Sam's hit! He lets go of his Redshirt, clutches his side-- Dead Man's Blood coursing through his veins. He's PARALYZED, watching as Jody charges towards him-- Dean leaps at Jody's neck, tears out her jugular.
>
> As Dean snarls, feeding on a DYING JODY-- BACK ON SAM-- fading... AU!Bobby coming up behind him with a machete. As Dean drops Jody's corpse, finally seeing AU!Bobby's approach on Sam--
>
> --too late. AU!Bobby's machete slices towards Sam's neck. As it makes contact--
>
> (back to present)

> Sam: It'll be better. If we win, if we beat you-- I'll <u>make</u> it better--
>
> Chuck: You can't Sam. You, Sam Winchester, have been playing fast and loose with the laws of magic and nature for a long time-- you and your brother. Always breaking the rules. I-- <u>I love that about you,</u> Sam. It's so heroic, so-- Promethean. (then) But there's so much about the fabric of the universe you still don't know-- that you <u>can't</u> know. 'Cause-- you're only humans. (then) But I'm <u>God</u>.
>
> Chuck: You think as long as you don't kill me, everything'll be fine-- all of existence won't collapse. Okay. But trapping me, taking me off the board-- you didn't think there'd be <u>consequences</u>? (then) Think about what I showed you, look past the Mark, look past you and Dean fanging out-- heartbreaking, but <u>not</u> the headline news.
>
> Sam: The monsters.
>
> Chuck: ("now you've got it") <u>The monsters</u>.
>
> Chuck: I know you see me as the bad guy, now. But my role in the universe, it's always been mixed-- more "chaotic neutral." (then) I do good, too.
>
> Sam: Like what?
>
> Chuck: I keep a balance-- a hand on the scales. I make sure you and your brother win more often than you lose. (then) Haven't you ever wondered why there aren't more monsters? Why vamps aren't out there breeding like bunnies? Me. That's me. Right here. (then) And without me-- it's a law of nature. Dark forces prevail, monsters rule. And you, your brother, and everyone you love will die.
>
> On Sam, crestfallen.
>
> Chuck: Can you really live with that?
>
> Off Sam, devastated, his faith in his plan shattering--

#### Side notes about destiel in Purgatory

> Dean: We should split up.
>
> Cas: What?
>
> Dean: You go that way -- I'll try this way. Meet back at the Rift. (off his look) We'll cover twice the ground -- improve our odds.
>
> Cas: Yes. It will also improve our odds of getting lost. Or killed.
>
> Cas is firm. On Dean -- seeing Cas's point.
>
> **Cas: I know you're worried about Sam. But -- however much we'd both like a break from each other right now -- splitting up's too risky.**
>
> Dean knows Cas is right -- but he's worked up, frustrated.
>
> Cas: Come on.

> Dean: Cas. Can you hear me?
>
> Dean: I hope it's not too late, that wherever you are-- you can hear this. (then) I should've stopped you.
>
> Dean: **When Mom died-- I blamed myself. Plenty. But even then-- I had plenty left to go around. So I put what I couldn't take on you. (then) I wanted you to stay-- of course I wanted you to stay.** You're my best friend. (then) But-- I let you go, 'cause it was easier than admitting I was wrong, and...
>
> Dean: <u>I'm sorry</u>.
>
> He's lost Cas in Purgatory, he doesn't have the Blossom, and he's running out of time. Off Dean, shattered, DEFEATED--

> Cas: We were en route. I waited-- until I saw this.
>
> And Cas holds out a Leviathan Blossom. On Dean-- holy shit.
>
> Cas: It got a bit-- smushed. (then) Once I had the Blossom, I fought-- caught them off guard. They fought back... I managed to get away...
>
> Dean: **It's-- amazing. You did-- amazing.**
>
> Cas: They're still looking for me. We should hurry--
>
> Cas trudges to the Rift. On Dean.
>
> Dean: Cas. I--
>
> Cas: Dean-- you don't have to. (then) I heard your prayer.
>
> As Dean and Cas, victorious and reconciled, enter the Rift--

> Dean and Cas hurriedly perform a spell-- Michael's spell. The BLOSSOM rests in a bowl-- as Cas chants above it.
>
> Dean watches, nervous-- as Cas pulls out a knife.
>
> Dean: Cas, you sure?
>
> Cas solemnly nods-- cuts himself, BLEEDS into the bowl.
>
> Cas: You've already taken the Mark. You can't take it again. <u>I</u> can. (then) It's the only way.
>
> Oh shit! Cas is taking the Mark! (And thanks to Chuck's flash forwards, we know how badly that ends.) As Cas resumes chanting... and the Blossom sputters with MAGICAL SMOKE--
>
> --Dean holds out an ORB (the orb we saw in Chuck's flash forward), catching the smoke as it rises... completing Michael's spell--

(Use for 2027 DCBB?)

## Main

> (mimic *The last of Us* title caption style, using day count to note changes, matching dates on Chuck's watch)

### Chap 1: Day 1 (01/16/2020)

> S15E09 Chuck shows Sam the monster ending, Dean/Cas show up with the orb. Sam doesn't lose hope, breaks the orb, locks Chuck up, Cas gets MoC, they officially start move toward the other monster ending's alter timeline.
>
> They go back bunker, Dean asks what Chuck shows him, Sam explains a bit (or in detail), Dean asks why he remains hopeful and decides to still lock Chuck up (even with that horrible ending for them, both having chills, but not any worse than S05E04): similar to S05E04 Dean seeing the endverse ending if he doesn't say yes to Michael what the world would become, but his takeaway is to not distant Sam; so here S15E09 Sam's takeaway from the monster ending is, they don't put Cas into Ma'lak Box, they'll help him, they can win this monster ending (at least die trying)
>
> Dean/Sam watch/observe Cas carefully, very cautiously tip-toe around him. Cas gets more self-conscious, snaps, already starts showing more grumpy and more tend to argue/retort/right. Dean notices/points out, Cas falls quiet. (slight unpleasant parting, each go back to own room; Dean might worry Cas would leave bunker, glad Cas just goes sulk in his room)

### Chap 2: Day 11 (01/26/2020)

> (case fics, could be short highlighted, summarized. Cas might help with the cases, but at a cost of huge collateral damage due to his decisions. Dean tries to steer Cas back to doing right thing.)
>
> (Cas's MoC symptom: have sudden flashbacks/visions; more violent, more grumpy)
>
> Cas's grace distained by MoC bit by bit, going dark/crazy day by day (currently the change is still small), but already starts showing worse temper, uneasy to stay in bunker with them, fights with Dean/Sam more, more fidgety, wants to take action/move/kill, more unlike old Cas by each day, attempts to leave bunker
>
> Dean/Sam slight panic/huge worry about him, keep close eyes on him, not sure what to do. Dean follows him around a bit (too much), mother-hens, tries to make sure Cas's okay; Cas snaps at him, annoyed; Dean is taken aback, Cas apologizes.
>
> Cas finds a case, missing people in Florida (canon alligator case changed). They go hunting, find five Wendigos (hint abnormal monster number), Dean spends time fighting them, Cas seems to enjoy the physical fight a little too much, getting himself all bloody and physical before smiting all of them, heals Dean/Sam. Dean suspects why he's enjoying the fight, Cas denies. Victims alive in the nest, one of them gets eyes burned out by the smiting grace (not shut in time, scream in pain), Cas heals the rest (only very slightly bothered, almost unbothered), Dean/Sam notices, more worried.
>
> Back to bunker, Sam secretly examines Ma'lak Box in the middle of night (or just hangs around there pondering), has quiet argument with Dean, overheard by Cas. Cas misunderstands they'd still want to lock him away, not trust him, storms out; Dean goes to catch him. some bad-tempered trust-issue-related fight.
>
> Dean manages to coo Cas, calms him down, leads him back to bunker. Physical touch helps, it sooths Cas more. They talk about how it feels to bear MoC, Dean understands and remembers, knows how difficult it is, Cas tells it's like a constant pull at the back of head and the skin is humming with energy (he doesn't feel this much power since godstiel time, it scares him). Dean understands and calms him, good quiet bonding moment.

### Chap 3: Day 93 (04/17/2020)

> (The day Claire would have been killed by vampires)
>
> Jody calls about vampire nest. Cas goes to help hunt with Dean/Cas. So many more vampires, Jody/Claire arm to the teeth, still all of them overwhelmed, Claire almost died. Cas rages, blows the whole building/area flat (overreact), takes everyone out, heals Claire. Claire is a bit spooked by unusually furious Cas, notices something off. Dean talks privately with Claire, covers for Cas. Dean talks with Sam, shares concern. Dean talks with Cas, caring, worried, wants to know how it's progressing.
>
> Cas is seeing bloody violent visions. Some bad bloody memories, some haven't happened, some people die. Cas sees himself kill Dean. Cas is spooked around Dean, keeping distance with Dean, scared he'd hurt him. Dean tries to comfort him (shared memory again).

### Chap 4: Day 126 (05/20/2020)

> (The same day in 2014 is S09E23 MoC Dean dies and becomes demon Dean)
>
> Cas sees flashback of Michael hurting/forcing/menacing John/Dean back in S4/5, Michael refusing to help them fight Chuck in S15. Cas thinks/hopes Michael might know how to release his bloodthirst feeling.
>
> Cas finds Michael, locates him (location is on his laptop/map/phone, or phone is tracked by Dean later; in Church, St. Michael), leaves bunker to go to Michael alone. Their talk turn into heated argument, Cas starts getting controlled/overwhelmed by MoC, holds grudge it's Michael's fault he's like this now (Michael can see his physical/angelic form changing too, mention it to him), gets violent, starts attacking Michael. Michael self-defenses, or getting impatient, or it's accident, or Cas threatens/kills Adam when Adam switches out to try to talk him down. (Michael still has grudge to Cas too, ass-butts and Molotovs him and leaves him in Cage for ten earth-years.) Michael rages (or accident), his archangel blade stabs Cas, kills him.
>
> Dean just gets to the spot right on time to see Cas is killed by the blade. Torched wingspan on church ground.
>
> Dean enters mourning mode, demands/pleads Michael to bring Cas back. Sam remembers one can't be killed if they bear MoC (Michael doesn't know)
>
> Dean hopeful, all waiting. Cas's eyes snap open, black demon eyes.

### Chap 5: Day 127 (05/21/2020)

> (next day)
>
> Cas opens demon eyes, makes demon growling sound, looks at them one by one, stares at Dean, then flies away.
>
> Dean panics, tries to deny, makes random theories. Michael can see the celestial/non-vessel change, tells them MoC brings Cas back alive and confirms it turned Cas to a demon (demon wings, demon eyes, the transformation process is still in progress, Cas must be not want to be seen like that so he flies away, but he's getting dangerous)
>
> (from now on below, Cas is a demon with MoC. turning a bit darker, a bit more mischievous/sour/bitter/sarcastic, a bit more morally ambiguous. Cas needs to learn how to live as a demon, vulnerable to salt/iron/holy water/demon trap)
>
> Dean tries to pray and phone call Cas, Cas doesn't reply or come back. Dean worries. They go back bunker.
>
> (Cas can't hear Dean's prayer now because he's not angel anymore, explain later)
>
> (some Cas POV to show the damage he did? the pain he's in realizing he's a demon now? fallen demon wing shatters in the places he's been?)
>
> (can morph/combine a bit from the next chapter about Dean's searching if this chapter getting too short)

### Chap 6: Day 171 (07/04/2020)

> (Six weeks and two days later, same duration as S12E09 Dean is gone and Cas can't find him; Independence Day)
>
> Dean finds evidences that monsters are being killed all over the country, with sulfur traces with them. Almost always have casualty or victim on site. Demons and ghosts are being killed too. (some conversation between Dean/Sam, talking about the time when Dean was a demon with Crowley; Dean hopes demon Cas can do better than him, but still too worried, a bit mourning widower state of mind too)
>
> Dean/Sam use spell to go to Hell (like S15E08 they just came back from there, or phone call? "You know you can just call me" number 666) to ask if Rowena can locate Cas (now that he's a demon, but Cas is not in her charge). Rowena uses tracking spell to locate Cas (like S13E20 tracking Gabriel, taste like haggis, can be sensed if powerful).
>
> Dean/Sam goes to the location Rowena gave them, still too late, monster there is already killed, remaining trace of sulfur. (demon hunter, like S06E20 deja vu)
>
> Dean/Sam go home miserably, thinking they'd never catch up with Cas again, surprisingly find Cas outside of bunker.

### Chap 7: Day 172 (07/05/2020)

> (next day)
>
> Dean powers down bunker's demon-proof defense system to let Cas in. Cas comes back because he senses Rowena's tracking spell on him, knowing it must be Dean/Sam looking for him.
>
> Sam scares of Cas's demon eye. Dean fears him too but talks to him, wants him stay. Cas is in demon mindset, wants to kill them (like S10E03 Dean, a bit *Shining* horror moment), very cold-blooded, murderous, blaming them for past mistakes and suffers (changed dramatically over the unseen six weeks). Dean guilty but determined to save him, strategically leads him to demon trap in dungeon, traps him there, ties him up. Sam helps too, the scare was half performance to let Cas's guard down against him.
>
> Dean injects Cas with his blessed human blood (like S08E23/S10E03 hell trial 3, using human blood to cure/purify demon). Cas is in pain during the transition, boiling, screaming. Dean apologizes and in pain while continues to do that, tears when he thinks he could be killing Cas for doing that ("I promised you I won't let you become a monster" "I already am." "No, you're not. You're Cas.")
>
> Cas's demon eye reverse to normal, more back to himself now (first sentence: "Hello, Dean. You look worried.")
>
> Dean asks if he's fully cured/reversed. Cas spreads wings, from the shadow, Dean/Sam can see leathery demonic wings, not fluffy feathery. Cas disgusts of his current wings (but complete, can fly).
>
> Dean sprays him holy water, Cas still gets burned. (Why not fully cured/reversed, just barely help him in control: human blood return human-turned-demon to human, Cas was angel-turned-demon, he'd need angel blood to be cured. The only angel they know is still around is Michael, but Michael's the one killed him, so out of option.)

### Chap 8: Day 179 (07/12/2020)

> (a week later)
>
> Cas promises to behave. Dean/Sam let him out of demon trap in dungeon, still very very cautious. Cas is more sentimental than usual, very emotional (like S09 human-blood-addicted Crowley).
>
> demon!Cas is addicted to Dean's human blood now, getting more clingy, a bit more handsy and sexual. When Cas is overwhelmed by the need of Dean's blood, he get very openly expressive, confesses to Dean he loves him, indicative of doing more between them (like S05E04 drug-high endverse Cas), and injects Dean's blood to get himself sated when he's allowed. (binge-watches chick-flicks in his room?)
>
> Dean in denial of Cas's love confession, says it's demon talking, says Cas isn't himself and it's not real (even if he clings to the touch a bit and closes his eyes, has to pull himself away), a bit jumpy.
>
> Cas upset at the denial, gets even darker when Dean doesn't accept him, demon symptom deteriorates worse, loses control, runs loose, breaks free, out of bunker. big collateral damage along the way, big massacre outside the town, blood-bath (cattle mutilation, remote deserted factory/location explosion → monster/gangster death, a lot of bad guy death, but unsure if deserve it fully; Chicago? Cas alone kills the whole five monster families in Chicago, S09E20)

### Chap 9: Day 180 (07/13/2020)

> (next day)
>
> Dean reads news, goes to Chicago, finds Cas.
>
> Cas is in control of MoC/demon dark side for now when Dean finds him, in one of the bombed site, in the middle of a lot of monster bodies, all torched (Cas doesn't have grace, but still have super demon power, like Crowley). more self-loath, self-disgust, self-punishment, painful, lonely, thinks he doesn't deserve, thinks sure it's why Dean won't ever love him, self-harm, self-hatred, suicidal. ( warning before chapter, heavy angst, bloody and violent and really really bad, suicidal attempts, self-harm)
>
> Cas prepares holy water and angel blade for himself, hesitating only because he doesn't know what would happen after death, if MoC would turn him into something even worse, he can't die, but he can still feel pain. Cas cuts himself on the wings with angel blade (clips black bat-like leathery wings, misses his white feathery wings, ultimate self-loathing), writes farewell letter for Dean (like Dean's suicidal farewell trip in S05E18), very very emotional, but thinks he deserves it, it must be his purpose and final punishment.
>
> Dean arrives right on time when Cas's about to try again to kill himself (or poke his demon eyes out, while stare at mirror, hate his own demon eyes, blood streaming, but self-heals/healed by MoC), Dean stops him, pulls him into a hug. Cas surprised, pulls away, thinks Dean must loath him, but still can't help addicted to Dean's blood. Dean cuts himself and lets Cas drink his blood, to make Cas feel better. Cas drinks and calms down, demon eyes return to normal blue eyes.
>
> Cas is haunted by the vision he'd be the monster that kills Dean/Sam then murders the world (+memory from S08E17+S07E01). Cas begs Dean to lock him into Ma'lak Box before he loses control again, then throws him into Mariana Trench or deepest Hell (he's a demon now, he belongs to Hell anyway, hope Rowena has enough ways to keep him there), he'd do it if he could do it himself, but he needs Dean lock him up from outside.
>
> Dean refuses, no matter what he says. Cas doesn't understand, or thinks he's still worried about Chuck's monster ending, tries to comfort him that he'd already kill most of the monsters in US, the remaining ones should be able to be under control just from hunters' works. Dean resents that he doesn't understand, Dean finally allows himself to love, to accept Cas as is. Dean kisses Cas ("You won't become a monster, because I'll be here.")
>
> (the big argument about putting Cas to Ma'lak Box eased out by the kiss (sex? not yet?) and Dean's confession/insistence; continue to diverge from Chuck's monster timeline, as long as Cas is not in Ma'lak Box)
>
> Dean brings Cas back to bunker.

### Chap 10: Day 344 (12/24/2020)

> (case fic: djinn, to save Eileen; the day Eileen would have been killed; Christmas Eve)
>
> Cas gets stronger/more powerful as demon/MoC affect, goes to hunt monsters with them, smite monsters easily. When Dean's good and kind to him, he's in control, they save people. Dean's very cautious about his own temper now too, becoming more caring and patient (because if Dean loses control, Cas is more easily losing control; Dean self-controlling is also for Cas's sake).
>
> (Cas would still lose control but redirect to monsters, keeping world-wide monster issue under control. but also show very clearly the change is still happening underway, making him more cold-blooded during hunting, blood-thirsty, brutal, cruel, dark. He tries hard to resist and keep control, not affected by visions and voices, but MoC needs to kill, it's a losing battle for him. They all can see it.)
>
> The current case is djinns, Eileen is in danger. They are thrown into different vision. Cas is temporarily hallucinated into the djinn world where he and Dean live a happy peaceful retirement life near beach, Dean has a small bar, Sam goes to live with Eileen and has family. Everyone happy.
>
> Then Cas sees his own demon reflection from djinn world mirror (like S03E10 Dean sees demon!Dean), he loses control, explodes temper/blood-thirst, kills Dean and everyone, the last is kills himself, wakes up, kills all the djinns (overreact explosion again), everyone is saved. Cas is scared again and wants to fly away again.
>
> Dean gives him soft moment again, shows him love, he's okay, he's in control, knows what's right, he's better than MoC, better than MoC!Dean. So Cas does exactly that, keeps himself together. Love is the only strongest thing in Cas that can't be darkened or taken, so Dean keeps doing that. Both of them try very hard to keep Cas on good side, see good/right choices, be good/kind.
>
> Discussion between Dean/Cas about what is love ("If I murder the world, would you still love me?" If yes, then what is it exactly that you're in love with? "You. Just you. All of you.")

### Chap 11: Day 357 (01/06/2021)

> (start more monster-of-the-day cases. This one, case fic: werewolves; the day in monster ending, shown to Sam)
>
> The place is packed with werewolves, the victims are bleeding out. They would have needed to wait, but Cas charges in and kills all the werewolves, big grand fight scene (Dean always amazed when Cas is in big awesome action scene). Cas heals the victims, saves everyone. They burn down all the werewolf bodies and the whole building.
>
> Dean says they wouldn't be able to save any of them if it's not for Cas to be there. Sam recognizes this is exactly one of the timestamps Chuck showed him in the monster ending vision, and they really already changed it, just because Cas is there.
>
> They're sure they're on the right track doing the right thing now, they'll save Cas and the world, everything is going to be fine.
>
> Cas is more fidgety than ever.
>
> At night, Dean/Cas snuggling time, they're getting more intimate (because Cas needs that to remain calm, and Dean's willing to give him anything, practically together now). Cas is more worried, Dean distracts him with more intimate actions, let him not think of the alternatives for now. (insert dream sequence? Cas sleeps but nightmares of the possibilities that he can still ruin everything? to show it's still unsettling.)

### Chap 12: Day 491 (05/20/2021)

> (the date: one year anniversary of Cas reviving as demon)
>
> (more close calls)
>
> Shapeshifter case, with Donna/Jody/Alex/Patience. (the day Donna and the girls would have been killed, make Jody the suicidal version in monster ending)
>
> More than one shapeshifter, change into Dean/Sam/Donna/Jody/girls. Cas gets messed up by the monsters, vision overlaps with reality, sees Dean dead, the shapeshifter!Dean mocks him. Cas turns demon eye. Dean appears, saying he is him; shapeshifter saying the same. Cas can't tell. Dean trusts he can tell, just let him make the decision, but quickly, others are dying and need him to save; shapeshifter is roughly also the same. Cas loses control, very very close to kill the real Dean, real Dean meets his eyes without fear, shapeshifter scares. Cas kills the shapeshifter, Dean is relieved. They help the others, all safe and saved.
>
> Jody sees Cas's demon eyes, Sam explains for Cas, Dean rushes out after Cas trying to leave the scene very quickly. Cas wants Dean to keep distance with him, stay far away from him, he's dangerous, looks at Dean with demon eyes, ashamed of himself. Dean asks instead how did he find out. Cas: "You're never scared of me. Even when I could kill you. I should go. I could kill you." Dean: "I don't care. You're staying."
>
> Dean reminds Cas he was about to kill Sam too when Dean was a demon, and what Cas said then was "Does Sam want a divorce?" "It would take a lot more than trying to kill Sam with a hammer to make him want to walk away." It applies to them now. (joke around "divorce"? "That means we'd have to have a relationship first. Oh God, am I your boyfriend?" → established relationship now?)

### Chap 13: Day 658 (11/03/2021)

> Vampire case, with Dean/Sam. (the day Dean/Sam would have been turned to vampires)
>
> The more Cas uses his demon power the more easily he'd be controlled by demon/MoC dark side (like S4 Sam). They try to limit Cas use power, mostly hunt with knives/blades/guns like normal human hunters (just like Dean/Sam) unless absolutely have to.
>
> A lot of vampires, overwhelm them. Normal knives/blades/guns aren't enough, Dean is pinned down by vampires, almost bitten. Cas has to use demon powers, shows demon eyes (like Crowley with red eyes in S10E22). Most vampires are killed, they let guard down, think it's over, Dean goes to check on Cas, gets jumped by one last surviving vampire, Cas throws himself before Dean, vampire bites Cas, vampire is dead immediately (poisoned by demon blood poison). But vampire venom makes Cas lose control, poisons Cas.
>
> Cas loses control, worse than ever, all demonic side are triggered, completely overwhelmed by dark side. When Dean checks on him, Cas beats Dean up and almost kills Dean (like S10E22 MoC!Dean). Cas remembers/accuses all the harm/pain Dean brings to him, all the times he died for Dean, for once Cas thinks for himself and it's not fair. Dean is too guilty to resist, completely not fight back, just let him beat, just keep saying it's not him, he believes Cas can wake up, "It's me. I need you." Cas cruel: "I know it's you." that's why he'll kill him.
>
> Killer blow. Cas raises blade high, grabs Dean at collar, ready to kill. Dean meets his eyes, actually ready to be killed, bloody and dying, mouthing "It's okay. I love you." Cas ends up resisting the killing instinct, stabs blade on the ground two inches away from Dean's face. "It won't miss next time." Dean is relieved.
>
> Sam jumps in, injects Cas with human blood (Dean's, pre-prepared? Dean wants to use on Cas during fight but can't quite?), mixed with holy water, boiling Cas up from inside, controlling him. Dean: "What are you doing!" Sam: "Save you!" Dean furious: "You're killing him!" Sam: "Or he'll kill you!" Dean ignores that part: "But you're killing him!" Dean pissed at Sam for making Cas in pain. Sam: "Unbelievable. You're welcome." Dean: "I got him!"

### Chap 14: Day 666 (11/11/2021)

> (date: one week later; also for demon number 666)
>
> Dean/Sam bring Cas back to bunker.
>
> Cas in demon cuffs in dungeon inside demon trap, Dean is there with him, physically exhausted and wounded too but doesn't leave. Dean does the blood purification therapy for Cas all over again. The effect is visibly smaller and smaller, Sam: "Resistance?" Dean: "Is that even possible?" Dean wants to increase the dose. But it would literally practically drain his blood, he can't extract any more of his blood. Sam calls in for blood donation help from Jody (in the background). They're not alone in this, Dean isn't the only one trying so hard to save Cas, Jody/Donna/Eileen/Claire all saved by Cas, now willing to save him too.
>
> Cas wake up, dozed on and off from all the human blood injection, floating between in and out of control. Cas regrets he hurts Dean, knows he's losing control, he's gone crazy, no way he'd be able to be sure Dean would be safe near him. Cas tries to persuade Dean again to put him into Ma'lak Box, he loses the battle, Dean/Sam would continue fighting, pretty sure it deviates from Chuck's monster ending long enough, they should be safe now.
>
> Even if it's true, even if it wouldn't go back collide onto Chuck's monster ending, Dean refuses. Dean reminds Cas what Cas said to him in S10E22 when Dean's MoC: "I'm the one who will have to watch you murder the world", now he's doing the same for Cas for as long as he can. Cas: "What would happen to me after you die?" Dean's mortal, it's not going to be forever. For the first time demon/MoC!Cas shows vulnerable, scared, he's scared of getting left behind alone, when no one is going to stop him murder the world, when Dean's not there, died of old age, he'd continue exist with MoC for eternity, not recognizing himself. That's his biggest fear. That's the real reason he'd want to be buried into Ma'lak Box, at least the world would be safe from him.
>
> Dean can only hold him close and tight, repeating they'll work it out. He promises he'll not let Cas be buried or completely gone to dark. They'll work it out. (hopeful, desperate, devastated, actually helpless, he has no idea how to solve this)

### Chap 15: Day 1059-1 (12/09/2022)

> (the day Dean/Sam would have died) (before-chapter warning: heavy angst, temporary MCD, suicidal thoughts)
>
> (demon/MoC!Cas actually kills Dean)
>
> Cas is semi-permanently locked to dungeon demon trap, human blood injection has no affect on him now. Dean's still there with him, just as company, it's their new routine now (been like this for a while). Cas is still pleased to see him there. Dean's reading and finds out Ma'lak Box is more than just a lock, the word and spell means "angel", it's actually angel medical box, anything locked in there maintain its state for as long as eternity, no cell would change, time is frozen in there (like DW Pandorica). But not sure if it's true, the only one knows about it for sure would be Billie.
>
> Dean plans to temporary suicide to go ask Billie to be sure (if it's real, it means immortal for him if he goes in there, the solution for them could be Dean/Cas both get locked inside Ma'lak Box, not lonely, not endangering anyone). Cas doesn't want him to "temporarily die", thinks it's too dangerous, he could really die, or Billie doesn't let him back. They argue, Dean has the syringe, they fight, Cas loses temper, shoves Dean. Dean falls, or Cas just accidentally instinctively attacks, or just somehow holds the syringe and stabs Dean, or to make a point to show if Dean really wants to die, there are easier ways, like Cas can do exactly that if that's what he wants and attacks and stabs him. (S10E14 Cain to MoC!Dean: "Then you'd kill the angel, now that one, that I suspect would hurt something awful" reversed, "Into the Fire" reversed, heavy angst)
>
> Dean is really killed, Cas comes back to himself later, pains/regrets/self-blame too much, heavy angst, heartbroken.
>
> Cas frantically tries to use his power to heal/resurrect Dean but can't.
>
> Sam comes back (temporarily out for a sec to do something mundane? library/grocery) horrified.
>
> Cas breaks demon trap (some spell or raw power to shatter dungeon floor, break the sigil), moves Dean to Ma'lak Box.
>
> Cas goes to Heaven to look for Dean (to apologize/make up/save him), while Sam medically tries to save Dean. (Sam doesn't trust Ma'lak Box's saving power, calls 911, entrusts modern medical)

### Chap 16: Day 1059-2 (12/09/2022)

> Cas doesn't care about anything anymore and goes to Heaven to find Dean (should burn him alive and kill him when he passes the heaven gate portal, which he doesn't mind and thinks he deserves it, end up purifying him, reverts demon!Cas back to angel!Cas, but MoC still there → this revert is basically because his love is too strong, demonization process is stripping out emotions/feelings, but love is not an emotion, not just a thread of feeling, it's everything, it's integrated into him, so strong and focused and pure that it becomes the spark that weave the rest of his consciousness back and gets rid of the demonness. so it's Heaven purifies demon, it's seeing Dean and the willingness to self-sacrifice for him that heal/revert the demon part in him)
>
> When in Heaven Cas sees Dean's heaven version of Cas and the two of them are basically doing same thing when they're on Earth, express love/feeling/hug/kiss, basically the same as before, except Dean seems truly happy/peaceful, not worried. Cas thinks Dean deserves the peace in afterlife, better not disturb him now, but stopped by Dean ("Where do you think you're going"), because Dean can tell the memory!Cas is not real Cas ("I'd rather have you", not perfect, darkened, but real). maybe they never really have sex before (or never penetrated) but here in heaven, for the first time, they do it for real, push one step further in their relationship, Dean reassure Cas he doesn't blame him for killing him, appreciate him coming to Heaven for him. Dean can see Cas's wings for real this time (because they're in Heaven, different dimension, different realm, different physics rule), Cas's wings are feathery again, Dean tells Cas he's beautiful (even with MoC)
>
> while having those moments in heaven, inserts background noise like beeping sounds, Dean realizes it's Sam sending his body to hospital, they're still doing emergency CPR on him, almost claim his death. But they still have a chance of going back if they want. Dean/Cas decide they want to continue a second (huh) chance, so Dean comes back; in hospital, it looks as if it's a electroshock worked, medically resurrected ("Dude you're dead for nine hours" "Nine hours, eighteen minutes", very rare but not impossible, called Lazarus Syndrome, the world record is seventeen hours "Don't encourage him")
>
> "What now, Cas?"

### Chap 17: Day 1111 (01/30/2023)

> (retirement ending)
>
> Like Cain, Cas tames MoC, retires as a bee-keeper (loves honey too), Dean stays there retiring with him. Dean would have been aging but Cas uses his power (limitless now, angelic now, fueled from MoC) to keep Dean young and alive. balance for each other, watch out for each other, live a retired beekeeper domestic life for eternity.
>
> It's like a God guard duty, Cas has been on guard duty watching Earth for millions of years before being charged with humans (Dean/Sam), now just shift to guard the lock to not let God out.
>
> Dean: "I'm with you." "You don't have to." "I want to."
>
> <br>
>
> abandoned other solution/endings (propose as their potential plans to save Cas):
>
> the same spell they use to save Dean (Dean will have to kill Cas to release it, and let MoC resurrect Cas before removing it → what if the timing is off, Cas will be really dead)
>
> split and transfer the MoC for more than one people to bear, Dean shares the Mark with Cas, both grey, but no one black
>
> split and transfer the MoC to all living souls (whole human race, everyone takes a piece to lock God away, this is the day Man defeat God → everyone live a little darker and longer; morally ambiguous proposal, not all human sign up for this, they're playing God to make the decision for whole human race, distain the whole human race, and they don't know it would work before they try, too much risk, they might end up killing all humans, or all humans turn too dark and kill each other (but alternative is Cas kill the world or monster kill the world, the world is doomed anyway, same risk) → "This is nuts" need to think if there's better solution)
>
> monster god ending: Chuck warns them his existence is the only reason why monsters don't overwhelm mankind, meaning it's his credit to keep monster number in control, meaning he'd have to keep working. so Cas has to keep working to smite monsters to keep human safe, he's like Chuck here for the balance, so he'd have to work eternity (but Chuck has been gone for centuries, monsters are in control all the time, earth and human is fine without him, he's a liar; can go back to retirement ending)
>
> retire ending: like Cain, Cas tames MoC, retire as a bee-keeper (loves honey too), Dean be there retire with him. Dean would have been aging but Cas uses his power (limitless now, fueled from MoC, but every time use it he'd be darker) to keep Dean young and alive (or partially as the split solution). balance for each other, live a retired beekeeper domestic life for eternity
