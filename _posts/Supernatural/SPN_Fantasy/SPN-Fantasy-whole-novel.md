  - 8AD, Venice, colored glass window
- colored glass architecture development timeline:
  - Gothic 12-16th

#### What is the colored glass/What is color

- **each color is a thought** (Cas's mind is made of colors)
- blue: **color of Cas's real form, Cas transform/born from the blue color**
- glass color as the memory note, bearer of the memory, used for self remind/catch up
- **it's a letter and a promise to keep, each blue line is a time when Cas reincarnate and the used up life force and memory are saved on the glass, already happened 13 times since 4k years ago, 300 years=1 line, Dean wait and guard for 4k years**
- blue is Dean's notes because when he ages he would forget, he uses it to remind himself of Cas's each life
- it's a curse or just how their life forms are supposed to be, **they shouldn't have been able to sustain this long but they use the glass to preserve them, the initial glass before any blue is added is their combined art work, they know each other from that age and already become really good and close but Cas would age Dean wouldn't**, (reverse of canon, a bit like Aziraphale/Crowley + Amy/Rory 2k y centurion)
- The Glass is: **a secret, treasure, love letter, promise, memo, memory, thought, missing, yearning**

#### What is Dean/Cas

- Cas is ice/wind/sky/comet, Dean is earth/rock/wolf/oak tree, both forget their true form, know they're not human but forget what they are
- one long life, one reincarnated short life creature: Dean is long life but will forget, Cas lives a human life time (100 year of living every 300 years)

- amnesia Cas/Dean
- Dean from planet of color and light, brighter than Earth, Earth is less colorful, too much grey, especially winter, his planet is more blue, more spring, more happy, homesick Dean, want to go back, doesn't want to give up, struggling but still managing, strong life force as well; troubled Dean, Dean magical creature/alien pretending to be human, suppressing special ability of transformation, good student trying to not use the special ability, struggling in human interaction, staring at window for long hours

- ~1400BC Dean dying of old age (avg age 45, already surpassing most, already credit to Cas), Cas still young, bc not really living, not human, share life force, fade back to color on the glass again, promise he'll be back, as long as Dean remembers him and he can create him again; Dean paints down blue, brings the glass and travels the world, paints all different kinds of blue on it
- 1200BC Egypt, Cas reemerges as life form, reunite and live together for 100y, fades again bc use up the life force too fast (being human exhaust the energy really fast); Dean: "I'll wait for you again", Cas: "I'll wait for you again"
- fast forward: 1AD Roman, Medieval, Gothic, Renaissance, now

## Draft

### Outline notes

(mystery solving, keep asking questions, reveal slowly)

**The question:** "What is he looking, what is the glass"

**beginning:** a secret, a treasure

**answer:** love letter, promise, memo, memory, thought (missing, yearning)

**a twist revelation**: thought it's Cas doesn't remember, Dean remember, notes are Dean writing to remind Cas; actually it's Dean doesn't remember, Cas remember, notes are Dean writing to remind himself not to forget Cas or else he won't be back

**revelations:**

1. Cas is blue (Act 2 start point)
2. Window is letter (Act 2 midpoint)
3. 3rd POV man is Cas (Act 3 start point)
4. Dean is forgetting (Act 3 last twist)



two-part story-telling, start modern, date back to ancient setting, evolve from ancient to modern, the colored glass is ancient old and still beautiful and complete

story start as urban legend of the campus, 3rd person view, a young man (which turns out to be Cas's newest incarnation, alias "Cael", lead to the twist revelation of who's forgetting)

~~story-telling tone, Dean: "There are so many stories, half of them are true, the other half, just haven't happened yet." (quote DW, used)~~

question-answer form, asking about each line for story and Dean tells them

the process of ask-answer and retell the stories is actually Dean re-reading the notes and re-remembering process



1500BC, Dean born in Mesopotamia, working as a metalsmith, love color, invent colored glass, invent the blue, put enough emotion in, Cas is created from the blue (he *is* blue, Dean name him angel of blue)

~1400BC Dean dying of old age, Cas still young, bc not really live, share life force, fade back to color on the glass again, promise he'll be back, as long as Dean remembers him and he can create him again; Dean paints down blue, brings the glass and travels the world, paints all different kinds of blue on it

1200BC Egypt the Red Sea (bluest water), Cas reemerges as life form, reunite and live together for 100y, fades again bc use up the life force too fast (being human exhaust the energy really fast); Dean: "I'll wait for you again", Cas: "I'll wait for you again"

### Outline compiled

(Dean POV, story-telling tone)

The story starts from an urban legend of the campus, rumor says the colored glass window in the south campus facing the lake is thousands of years old, and there is a man guarding it since the age before dawn. Then show there is a weathered man sitting on the bench before the glass, not aged, but his eyes worn and lonely. Out of place and doesn't look like a part of the school, but almost looks like a part of the building. A young student sits down next to him, asking him about what he's thinking, why he's here. The weathered man with green eyes starts telling a story:

In 1500 BC, there was this man born in Mesopotamia, named Dean. He worked as a metalsmith, loved colors, and when he was working on constructing metals and weapons, he added rare metal to the heated melting quartz and invented colored glass. He experimented, and invented the most beautiful blue he (and the world) had ever seen. He loved the color so much, put enough emotion in it, and even named it. The name he gave the blue is Castiel, angel of blue. This is the age before dawn, the age before Roman and Greek, the age when magic was not a legend and god walking among them. And when gods and angels were created from man's belief. So Angel of Blue got his life, because Dean stared at the color long and lovingly. Castiel came to life.

For a life time, Dean spent with Cas, building things together, the glass, the metal, the inventions, the art, the creations. They create together, they spend a hundred year together. By 1400 BC, Dean was near the end of his human life. It's already longer than any man at that time, he had no regret except for having to leave Cas alone. Cas was still young, looking exactly the same the day he was created, because neither of them really knew if the form Cas was in, that human form out of the trueform, is it really him and is he really a living being. He was not human, but he had life force.

On Dean's deathbed, he was telling his last words to Cas, his love and his happiness and luck in that hundred years, Cas couldn't see him die, so Cas shared his life force with Dean, and faded back to a strip of blue on the colored glass they built together. He promised he'd be back, as long as Dean remembered him. He gave him life once, he could create him again.

Dean continued to live as a young man, he painted down all different kinds of blue colors on all different materials. He travelled across the world, always carrying the small piece of colored glass with him, with that one strip of blue. People thought he was weird, mad even, because he looked at it as if it were the love of his life. And he never aged.

In 1200 BC, Red Sea, Egypt, Dean saw the bluest water ever, and painted it down, Cas reemerged as a life form, they reunited and lived together for a hundred years. The clock started ticking for Dean again because he was really living the life. By the end of another hundred years, Cas had to do it again, shared his own life force, so Dean could be young and live again, and Cas faded into the second line of blue on the glass Dean carried. They both knew it was not a farewell. Dean said he'd wait for him again. And Cas said the same.

That was how their story kept going, the history fast-forward:

1 AD, they met in Roman, Venice had the bluest sky, they witnessed the Roman Empire

600 AD and 900 AD, they reunited at the Medieval time when people had the bluest beliefs, they witnessed the crusades

1200 AD Gothic time, the bluest music at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, France

1500 AD Renaissance, the bluest poetry in Italy, Petrarch's Sonnets to Laura

1800 AD Gothic Revival, the bluest story, Wuthering Heights, England

The weathered man tells the story as he points out the color on the glass window. There are thirteen long and short strips of blue, thirteen times they've met and lived. The window is a memoir, the color is a language, he's reading it like looking at a love letter. Even if either of them forgot their past lives, they could remember if they just looked at the notes, and got reminded. Even if they forget who they are or forget each other's name and face, they look at the glass and remember. He's Dean.

The young man sitting next to him whom he thinks is a student asks him if he finds the pattern in the times Cas comes. Dean thinks every time Cas comes to him is when there is something so blue that his emotion has become so strong, that the life force condensed and conjured Cas into life. The young man asks, "Then what is so blue now?" Dean: "Me." This is the bluest winter, his loneliness, alienness, he's homesick, cold, doesn't belong to this time and place, people look at him funny. He thinks of Cas so much, because now he needs him the most, misses him the most. Even though it's been another three hundred years, and he can hardly remember what Cas looks like. And the young man looks at him with his blue, blue eyes, "Hello, Dean."

### Summary

The man has been sitting there for ages, looking at the colored window facing south, not moving an inch, as if he's been there since the dawn of time. The afternoon sun shines on the window, casting a shade of blue on the marble floor. His eyes follow the color, deep, weathered, and indescribably sad.

A kind, young student sits next to him, asking if he's okay.

The weathered man says, "Let me tell you a story. A story from four thousand years ago, about a man named Dean, and a color of blue."

The man has been sitting there for ages, looking at the colored window facing south, not moving an inch, as if he has been there since the dawn of time. The afternoon sun shines on the window, casting a shade of blue on the marble floor. His eyes follow the color, deep, weathered, and indescribably sad.

Every campus has legends of their own, and rumor says, the colored glass window in the south campus facing the lake is thousands of years old, and the man guarding it is even older. Young art students pass the corridors, passing the man as if he is not there. He doesn't look like a part of the place, but almost like a part of the building, a part of the wall and window, a statue.

A kind, young student sits next to him, asking if he's okay.

The weathered man says, "Let me tell you a story. A story from four thousand years ago, about a man named Dean, and a color of blue."

<br>

In 1500 BC, there was this man born in Mesopotamia, named Dean. He worked as a metalsmith. The furnace burned hot and melted metals, he waved hammers to break the hardest metals and build them into weapons. The weapons that would be used for wars, for attacking, for defending. For violence.

He looked at the spears and shields created in his hands, thinking, the world should be more than that. More than violence. More than blood. More than things that could be used to kill others. He looked at his hands, and decided, those should be used to create, not to destroy.

He went looking for colored stones and ores from mines, and he added to the heated melting quartz in his furnace. Metals moltened into liquid, and when they solidify, they turned into the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. The translucent glass shimmered with a gleamer of blue, like sky, like sea, but so much more. He held his breath, taking the colored glass against the sun.

It was the most beautiful color he had ever seen -- the world had ever seen. It shifted under the sun, swam in the solidified glass, like a life portrait in a painting, like a statue, so vivid yet so still. The blue was otherworldly, ethereal. Dean forgot to breath, and believed he had a glimpse of Heaven just through it. Tears came down from his face and dropped on the colored glass.

He loved the color so much he carried it with him all the time. He held it in the place close to his heart. He stared at it every time he thought about it, and every time that blue grasped his breath away with its beauty. It shimmered under the sun, gleamed with life. Dean thought, it must be alive, how else could it be so astonishingly beautiful? He thought, it must be an angel that he caught eyes on.

He called it the Angel of Blue.

It was the age before dawn, the age before Roman and Greek, the age when magic was not a legend and gods walking among mankind. And that was an age, that gods and angels were created from man's belief.

It must be how it happened, Dean thought. That was how the Angel of Blue emerged from the colored glass, from the color itself, standing before him. Because he stared at the color long and longing, because his tears dropped on it, because he put it near his heart for days and nights.

The Angel of Blue came to life.

And he had the bluest eyes.

"Does he have a name? The Angel of Blue?" the young student asks.

The weathered man looks at the colored window, deep in thought. "I think he does," he answers dreamily, more sadness seeping out of his eyes. "I think he does, but it's a story from a long time ago now. Too long, and the name was lost."

"Dean would give him a name as beautiful as the color," the young student says gently.

The weathered man turns to him slightly, a small smile curling on the tip of his lips. "Yes, yes, it is! I remember now. That most beautiful name is 'Castiel' -- he called him 'Cas'."

<br>

For a life time, they spent together, Dean with his Angel of Blue, his muse of creation, in the age of dawn. They built together, they created together -- glass, metal, art, inventions, creations. They lived together.

For a hundred years, they walked the Earth together, traveling from one land to another. For a hundred years, Dean wondered if it was a dream. He kept the very first colored glass with him for all his life, closest to his heart. His fingers caressed that astonishingly beautiful shade of blue whenever he thought of him, and Cas would hold his hands and tell him, "That was me. I am right here now."

A hundred years was long, for a Mesopotamian, for a human -- it was already so much longer than any other man he knew, but it still didn't feel long enough when he lied on the bed, aged and withered. Cas sat by his bed, holding his hands, looking just as young and beautiful as the first day he appeared. Exactly same shining blue eyes, same hair, same face. The color of blue did not age, nor did him.

"I have no regret in my life but one," Dean, old man that he was, told Cas with a weak smile, "that I'll have to leave you alone now."

His breath faded thin, but he struggled with the last thread of that breath to tell Cas how much joy and luck he had in that hundred years. "I was a lucky man to find you, and you came to me." Dean smiled at him, gentle, loving. "Remember all the places we went together? All the metal we created together? I wouldn't trade a single day with anyone else."

"I love you," he told his angel, his blue, the love of his life. "I told you a hundred years and I will say it one last time. Goodbye, my love."

"No --" Cas knelt before his bed, holding his hands. Tears falling from his face, just like the tears fell from Dean's the first time he saw the color of blue that was Cas.

"I could not see you die," he cried. "I was not even human, but you gave me life. So now, I'm giving this life back."

He took out that beautiful little piece of glass Dean held dearly to his heart, and touched it with a sad, but happy smile. "So you can continue to live now."

He started fading, like a fairy going back to the flower that conjured him. He was going back to be just a strip of blue, a color on a glass, the true form that he was. He still looked at Dean with those beautiful, bluest eyes as he faded, "Goodbye, Dean."

The age left Dean, reversed like clock turning backwards, as Cas fading. He sat up from the deathbed, holding Cas's hands with more tears. "No, Cas --" he cried, "Why are you doing this? Will I ever see you again?"

With the last strength as human, Cas smiled at him. "You will, Dean. You gave me life once, you could create me again. Remember me, and I will be back."

With that, he faded entirely.

The colored glass had an extra strip of blue with more bright and shimmering life in it.

Dean thought, he could still see Cas's smile in it, and his eyes. He kissed the blue and promised him, "I will remember you."

"Did he remember?" the young student asks. "Did Cas come back, like he promised?"

The weathered man walks to the big colored window before them, touching long strips of blue patterns inlayed in the Mosaic. "Not at first," he says, looking through the color. "For two hundred years, Dean lived alone, never aged a day, never forgot his Angel of Blue. But he was afraid he might, and he knew, if he did, Cas would never come to life again. The thought of never seeing him again troubled him tremendously."

"But the blue on the glass, he would always remember when he looked at that blue, didn't he?" the young student asks him softly, following his gaze.

The weathered man turns to him slightly. "Yes," he smiles a little, thinking, "the blue on the colored glass, it's so much more than color, do you know that?"

The smile makes his eyes younger -- the weathered man is not old, he has a young man's face, but it's the eyes that gives away the time he must have seen. And now, they are brightening up, as he watches the colored glass closely.

His finger traces the pattern. "It's a letter, a notebook. It has everything that needs to be remembered, if you know how to read it."

He glances at the young student. "You have lovely blue eyes, too, just like him."

The young student smiles warmly, nodding at the window, "What does it say?"

<br>

Dean continued to live as a young man. He painted down all different kinds of blue that he saw on his way, on all different materials. He added different stones to the furnace, and created new things from them.

He came back to Mesopotamia, but he didn't stay for long. It was a new land to him, just like all the other lands, with no one he knew. He travelled to Babylon, to Egypt, as far as India, even China.

He travelled across the world, always carrying that small piece of colored glass with him. He looked and kissed the two strips of blue on it. People thought he was weird, mad even, because he looked at it as if it were the love of his life. They laughed at him. Dean never argued.

And he never aged. He thought it must be because the life was shared by Cas, and Cas did not age.

He never had any companion for his travelling -- his wandering and drifting, really, for he didn't have a home to come back to -- he didn't think he needed one. He was just waiting for someone to come back.

In 1200 BC, at Red Sea, Egypt, Dean saw the bluest water ever, and painted it down. "I wish you can see this, Cas," he spoke to the water, dangling his feet on the shore. "It's so beautiful, it reminds me of you. But I know, if you *are* here, it would look as pale as cloud in a rainy sky."

The colored glass in his chest warmed up, and a voice sounded up behind him, "I'm here now."

Cas reemerged, just as he rememberd. The blue eyes, the black hair, the curl on his lips -- nothing changed from the last time he saw him.

Dean grabbed him and held him for a long time, buried his face on his shoulder. "I missed you," he told him. "I waited for so long."

Cas held him tight, leaning his cheek on his. "I missed you, too, Dean," he said, quietly sobbing.

For another hundred years, they lived together, travelling the world together. The clock of life started ticking for Dean again, because with Cas, he started really living the life.

The world was different from the last time they were here, they went to the places they had seen, and places they hadn't. It didn't matter where they went, Dean thought, happy, even if everything was the same, even if everyday was the day, with Cas, he was content.

By the end of another hundred years, Dean was too aged to move another step. They sat by the riverbank of Red Sea, Dean's eyes were closing.

"It's so good to see you again, Cas," Dean told his Angel of Blue, the love of his life. "But now, I have to go now. I already had twice the life than anyone, I was a lucky man. My only regret is I can't stay longer for you, for I am only a mortal, yet your true form is so much more eternal."

Cas leaned on him, resting his lips on Dean's cheeks, tears falling. "I will not see you die, Dean. My true form is nothing but a strip of color, it's you who gave me life and let me know the world and life has so much to see. I have to give it back to you now."

Dean sobbed, for he knew what would come. He hugged Cas like his life depended on it. "I will wait for you again," he told him.

Cas wiped his tears away with his fingertips. "It's not a farewell," he comforted him softly, with a teary smile of his own, and said the same. "I will wait for you again."

As Cas faded away, Dean turned from an old man to young, and the colored glass he carried, added a new strip of bright blue. As blue as the Red Sea water before him, reminding him of everything the past hundred years they have spent together.

That was how their story unfolding, the wheel of history turning, and they walked among it together.

For three lives, they travelled the Earth before the Common Era. The lands were wild and free, and they saw the rising of the bluest architecture made of glazed bricks, the Ishtar Gate of Babylon.

They met in Roman again, in 1 AD. Venice had the bluest sky, and they witnessed the lively cities of Roman Empire.

For three times in the dark age of Medieval time, they reunited when they witnessed the crusades from people with the bluest beliefs.

They listened to the bluest music at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in France, in the Gothic time of 1200s.

By the time of Renaissance, they went to hear the bluest poetry in Italy, when Petrarch was creating *Sonnets to Laura*.

They read the bluest story together in 1800s from the talented and lonely girl from Brontë family, the story of *Wuthering Heights*.

And that was the last time Dean had seen him.

### Act 4

> current time, 2000AD (bluest winter -- loneliness, alienness, homesick, cold; combine with chap 1's passing line about out of place)

> who is the one forgetting: Dean

The weathered man tells the story as he points at the color on the glass window.

"Dean made that piece of colored glass large," he tells the young student. "So there can be more space for Cas to return to."

He chuckles a little, thinking. "It's like making him a bigger room to stay before he comes to life again. A bigger house."

The young student smiles with him, "I'm sure he appreciate that."

The man tilts his head, looking back at the glass. The afternoon sun is setting slowly, the brightened pattern is dyed with a warm orange color. But the blue lines on there are still vigorously shimmering with the color of sea and sky. Winter frost on the other side of the window layers it with icy crystal, making the color even more ethereal than it already is. There are thirteen long and short strips of blue -- thirteen times they've met and lived.

"I never knew color can be a language," the man says slowly, "or they can have life. Maybe I did, and I forgot."

He lowers his head, staring at the lowest strip of blue, the one that has the darkest color. When he raises his head again, there are glimmers of tears in his eyes. He asks, "What if I'm forgetting things? I feel old every time I am alone, but I can't remember how old. I feel like I forget a lot of things, even my own name, sometimes. All I remember is only that story. All I know I can't forget is that story. What should I do if I forgot some really important things?"

The young student puts a hand on his shoulder, rubbing him gently. "Why don't you look at the glass then? It's like a memoir, isn't it? Maybe just read some more, and you'll remember."

The man sits back at the chair before the colored glass, reading it like a book, a diary, a long journal. The other man sits next to him, watching him studiously.

"Do you remember now? Who are you?" he asks patiently.

"Yes," the weathered man blinks rapidly, breathing out, drops of tears tangled on his eyelashes. "I'm Dean. I'm the one from the story I thought was someone else's."

His young companion smiles encouragingly.

"And I think, after all these times, I finally find out the pattern in the times Cas came." Dean says, contemplating.

"What is that?"

"When there is something so blue that I could never hold it back again, it stirred in me, consumed me; when I miss him so much it's going to kill me, eat me alive; when the life force is about to leave me, that's when he'd come to life, to save me, to bring *me* to life again." Dean huffs quietly with realization, the drop of tear falls from the corner of his eyes. "He comes to me when I need him the most. God, I miss him so much."

He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand.

"Then what is so blue this time?" his young listener asks.

"Me," Dean tells him.

It's the bluest winter. He tells him his loneliness, his alienness. He doesn't belong to this time and place. He's homesick, and he's cold. They are on a land so far away from the land he was born. He misses the sun and wind of Mesopotamia but he can never go back again. He thinks of Cas so much, because he's the only one who knows him, who will understand. He's the only one he can feel at home, when home is no more. He thinks of Cas every living second with every inhale and exhale of his breath, his chest hurt from the pining.

Several students walk by the corridor they're in, schoolbags on their backs, chatting with their friends, casting curious looks at them. They walk on with fast pace, forgetting about them the moment they walked by, as if they are nothing more than a tree by the road, a window on the wall, a statue in the campus.

Dean's eyes linger on the tiles they stepped on, then wander back to the quiet listener sitting next to him. He realizes he doesn't have a schoolbag, nor is he wearing school uniform. He doesn't know why he assumed he's just another student of the campus -- they don't usually stop and sit down with strangers, and spend hours listen to their long and old stories.

"It's been almost another three hundred years," Dean whispers, devastated, "I missed him so much but I can barely remember his face. I was afraid I wouldn't recognize him even if he stands right before me."

His voice trembles, then, when he asks, "Who are you?"

The man sitting next to him reaches out to take his hands, landing a kiss on the back of his hands, with their eyes locked and a small smile emerging.

Cas looks at him, with his blue, blue eyes: "Hello, Dean."

> The weathered man tells the story as he points out the color on the glass window. There are thirteen long and short strips of blue, thirteen times they've met and lived. The window is a memoir, the color is a language, he's reading it like looking at a love letter. Even if either of them forgot their past lives, they could remember if they just looked at the notes, and got reminded. Even if they forget who they are or forget each other's name and face, they look at the glass and remember. He's Dean.
>
> The young man sitting next to him whom he thinks is a student asks him if he finds the pattern in the times Cas comes. Dean thinks every time Cas comes to him is when there is something so blue that his emotion has become so strong, that the life force condensed and conjured Cas into life. The young man asks, "Then what is so blue now?" Dean: "Me." This is the bluest winter, his loneliness, alienness, he's homesick, cold, doesn't belong to this time and place, people look at him funny. He thinks of Cas so much, because now he needs him the most, misses him the most. Even though it's been another three hundred years, and he can hardly remember what Cas looks like. And the young man looks at him with his blue, blue eyes, "Hello, Dean."

**Revelation:** POV man is Cas, Dean is forgetting
