> Dean: Cass, are you there? Sammy's hurt. He's hurt, uh – he's hurt pretty bad. And, um... I know you think that I'm pissed at you, okay? But I don't care that the angels fell. So whatever you did or didn't do, it doesn't matter, okay? We'll work it out. Please, man, I need you here.

> Dean: Screw it. Okay, listen up. This one goes out to any angel with their ears on. This is Dean Winchester... And I need your help.

> Death: Well, I had to come myself.
>
> Sam: I bet you get off on this.
>
> Death: Perhaps. But not in the way you assume. I consider it to be quite the honor to be collecting the likes of Sam Winchester. I try so hard not to pass judgment at times like this – not my bag, you see, but you... <u>Well played, my boy.</u>
>
> Sam: I need to know one thing.
>
> Death: Yes.
>
> Sam: If I go with you... can you promise that this time it will be final? <u>That if I'm dead, I stay dead. Nobody can reverse it, nobody can deal it away... and nobody else can get hurt because of me.</u>
>
> Death: I can promise that.

> April: Funny. You don't look like the knife-fight type. Or the homeless type, actually.
>
> [She starts cleaning his wound.]
>
> Castiel: Yes. Well... I guess I trusted the wrong person.
>
> April: Bad investment advice?
>
> Castiel: No, vanity. I thought I was more important, more effective than I am, that I could... fix everything. Now all I can do is keep running.
>
> April: Well, all patched up, but, God, your delts are in knots. You got to relax.
>
> Castiel: Ah, it's all new to me. Hunger. Cold. <u>This feeling, being all alone.</u>
>
> April: You're not alone tonight.

> Castiel: Why didn't you just attack me right away?
>
> April: My briefing said you were dangerous and powerful. And you did arrive armed, so... I needed information, so I had to gain your trust.
>
> Castiel: <u>And that required intercourse?</u>
>
> She laughs.
>
> April: Well, I am allowed some leeway for executive decisions.
>
> [She straddles his lap.]
>
> April: <u>And I can't say I didn't find you attractive.</u>

> Dean eyes the angel blade still sticking out of Castiel's chest. Sam gets up to face April but before he can make a move she punches him across the face and sends him back to the floor. April turns around just in time for Dean to stab her in the chest, killing her in a flash of brilliant white light. Dean turns to Castiel.
>
> Dean: Cass. Cass. Cass!
>
> <u>Dean shakes Castiel but he is cold and unmoving. Dean's voice breaks.</u>
>
> Dean: Cass! No.
>
> Sam regains consciousness and rises from the floor as Dean realizes:
>
> Dean: Sam, he's gone.
>
> Sam approaches Castiel, quietly and solemnly. Dean looks up and realizes that it's actually Ezekiel, not Sam. Ezekiel kneels down and gently places his hand over Castiel's chest. With another bright white light, all of Castiel's wounds quickly heal themselves.
>
> Ezekiel finally finishes healing Castiel and stumbles backwards, weakened. Castiel gasps back to life as Ezekiel slumps back to the floor, unconscious again. Dean goes to help Ezekiel/Sam but stops and turns when Castiel speaks.
>
> Castiel: Dean.
>
> Dean: Hey. Hey! Yeah.
>
> Sam wakes up again, evidently shocked by the scene he's woken up to.
>
> Castiel: And Sam.
>
> Sam: Cass. You're okay.
>
> Castiel looks equally as confused as Sam.
>
> Dean: <u>(To Castiel) Never do that again!</u>

> Castiel is on a ladder, changing a fluorescent tube bulb.
>
> Nora enters.
>
> Nora: Hey, Steve? I found this in the supply closet. (She holds up a plastic bag with … toothpaste ? in it) Do you know whose it is?
>
> Castiel: Um... (comes down from the ladder) That's mine. Thanks.
>
> Nora: I also found a rolled-up sleeping bag behind the tool locker.
>
> Castiel: Yes, <u>(thinking fast) I wanted to be thorough with inventory, so I worked late last week, and taking a nap here was easier than going back home to my bed. Which I-I have, of course – a bed...and a home.</u>
>
> Nora: Wow, Steve. You're so... responsible.
>
> She walks away, and he turns to go back to the ladder.

> Dean clicks the phone closed. <u>He stares at the Gas'n'Sip convenience store, and Castiel, visible through the window, bagging a purchase for a customer. Dean thoughtfully taps his cell on the car.</u>

> The next customer in line is Dean.
>
> Dean: I'll have some beef jerky and a pack of menthols.
>
> Castiel: What are you doing here?
>
> Dean: <u>Gee, it's nice to see you, too, Cass.</u>
>
> Castiel: It's … Steve now. (gesturing towards his employee name tag) And... uh, you know you surprised me.
>
> Dean: Well, the feeling is mutual. I mean, I knew you had to lay low from the angel threat, but, uh, wow. This is some cover.
>
> Castiel: My Grace is gone. What did you expect? Do you have any idea how hard it was? When I fell to earth, I didn't just lose my powers. I – I had nothing. <u>Now... I'm a sales associate (proudly).</u>
>
> Dean: A sales associate?
>
> The beer delivery guy hands "Steve" a clipboard.
>
> Delivery Guy: Hey, Steve. Sign here?
>
> Castiel takes the clipboard and signs it, continuing to speak to Dean.
>
> Castiel: <u>I'm responsible for inventory, sales, customer service. I keep this place – (he hands the clip board to the delivery guy, who says "Thank you" and leaves) – Thank YOU (to the delivery guy) – clean and presentable. And when my manager's busy, I even prepare the food.</u>
>
> Dean: Wow. So you went from fighting … heavenly battles to nuking taquitos?
>
> Castiel: (nodding) Nachos too.

> Baby crying. Castiel walks in tentatively.
>
> Castiel: Hello? Um... Please – please don't. Um … Okay. Oooo-kay, okay. (Picks up the baby.) How 'bout – how 'bout a lullaby? Um... Okay. Shh. Shh!
>
> Castiel singing "Believe It or Not" (the theme from "The Greatest American Hero"):
>
> ♪ <u>Look at what's happenin' to me</u> ♪
>
> ♪ I can't believe it myself ♪
>
> ♪ suddenly I'm up on top of the world ♪
>
> ♪ it should've been somebody else ♪
>
> The baby stops crying.
>
> ♪ oh, believe it or not ♪
>
> ♪ I'm walkin' on air ♪
>
> ♪ I never thought I would feel so free-e-e ♪
>
> ♪ flyin' away on a wing and a prayer ♪
>
> ♪ who could it be? ♪
>
> ♪ Believe it or not, it's just me ♪
>
> ♪ believe it or not, it's just me ♪
>
> Castiel tries to put the baby down and she starts crying again. He picks her up again.
>
> Castiel: <u>Shhh. I know, I know.</u>

> Castiel is sitting in a chair with the baby, holding and rocking her.
>
> Castiel: <u>(to the baby) Nobody told you. Nobody explained. You're just … shoved out kicking and screaming into this human life, without any idea why any of it feels the way it feels, or why this confusion, which feels like it's … a hair's breadth (The baby stops crying.) from terror or pain. You know, just when you think you do understand, it'll turn out you're wrong. You didn't understand anything at all. Guess that's just how it is when you're new at this. You know, it wasn't that long ago when all I'd need to do to ease your pain was touch you.</u>

> Castiel is putting the baby into the crib. She's not crying at this moment, actually!
>
> Castiel: It's a fever, Ephraim. It will pass.
>
> Ephraim: You remember my name? I was just a nobody when we met, but you – <u>you were a legend</u>. You've been here before. This is my first time, and it's ... intense.
>
> Castiel: You know, there's a lot you don't understand about humanity at first. If you would just stop—
>
> Ephraim: Stop? I won't stop … until I wash the planet clean of all suffering.
>
> The baby starts fussing again. Ephraim steps towards her:
>
> Ephraim: Allow me.
>
> Castiel: (standing in his way) <u>Don't. Touch. Her.</u>
>
> Ephraim: You think I came for her? No, Castiel. I came for you.
>
> He moves around Castiel to the baby. Castiel appears stunned.

> Ephraim is talking, as villains are wont to do. While listening, Castiel runs his hand on the thorny rose he brought for Nora.
>
> Ephraim: So much pain and despair, so many voices begging out for relief.
>
> Castiel: How'd you find me?
>
> Ephraim: Because you're warded? The same way I find all my patients – <u>I just followed the sound of your pain. You have no idea how loud it is. I could hear you for miles.</u>
>
> Castiel is walking away from the baby's room; Ephraim is following.
>
> Castiel: Do you really think you're doing Heaven's work down here?
>
> Ephraim: I know I am.
>
> Castiel: Well, you're wrong. Earth can be a hard place. <u>But these humans, they can get better. They're just doing the best they can.</u>
>
> Ephraim: Is that what you think you're doing, Castiel – the best you can? Well, I'm sorry. But if this is the best that <u>the famed Castiel</u> can do, you're a more urgent case than I thought. <u>I used to admire you. You failed more often than you succeeded. But at least you played big.</u>
>
> Ephraim looks down – and notices that Castiel is drawing a sigil on the door in his own blood. He grabs Castiel's hand before he completes the sigil, bending it sharply; there's a cracking sound and Castiel yells in pain. Ephraim shoves him away from the door, and still holding Castiel by the wrist, forces him to his knees, palm upward.
>
> Ephraim: Now what are you doing? Burying your head in the sand. Right when your kind needs you the most.
>
> Ephraim twists Castiel's wrist painfully and Castiel gasps.

> Ephraim: Shh-shh-shhh. It'll be over soon. I'll take the pain away.
>
> Castiel: <u>I want to live.</u>
>
> Ephraim: But as what, Castiel? As an angel? or a man?

> Ephraim: You say you want to live. But you can't see what I see. By choosing a human life, you've already given up. <u>You … chose … death.</u>
>
> Ephraim lifts a hand to Castiel's forehead.
>
> Dean slides the knife across the floor towards Castiel.
>
> Castiel grabs it and stabs Ephraim. White light bursts out of Ephraim and he screams; Dean ducks his head to shield his eyes from the blinding white light. A torrent of white light streams out of Ephraim's mouth as his scream continues. The body of the formerly-possessed, now-dead, husband falls to the floor.
>
> Dean pants. Castiel looks solemn.

> Nora and Castiel are leaving her house.
>
> Castiel: (awkwardly) I'm, uh, sorry I overreacted. Um. My friend gave me a tip. A low dose of acetaminophen brought the fever right down.
>
> Nora: Oh, that's okay. Date was a bust anyway. (pause; Castiel walks down the stairs) Steve? (Castiel stops and turns to look at her.) <u>The part of you that overreacted, that cares so much? That's what makes you special.</u>
>
> Nora smiles at Castiel-as-Steve sentimentally and turns to go back into her house as he goes out through the gate.

> Castiel gets out of the car, looks in through the window at Dean, and they wave goodbye to each other. Castiel walks to the Gas'n'Sip and unlocks the door as Dean starts up the Impala.
>
> Castiel does the coffee, puts the cash drawer in the cash register. Turns on the TV:
>
> TV News Announcer: *It's been weeks since the massive meteor storm, yet Idaho Falls astronomers still have unanswered questions. NASA and Washington are both continuing to study the phenomenon.*
>
> Castiel switches off the TV and goes to look out the window, moodily.

> [Sam sighs heavily and sits on the bed.]
>
> Dean: What's up?
>
> Sam: What if there is something wrong with me -- something...really wrong?
>
> Dean: You're just crapped out, man. You need some rest.
>
> Sam: Oh, it's more than that. I mean, Vesta said I was practically dead inside.
>
> Dean: Oh, and she's in the circle of trust now?
>
> Sam: Why would she lie?
>
> Dean: It's probably the trials, okay? Probably some sort of a, you know, aftereffect. It's not like you're bouncing back from the flu here. I mean, you were glowing with freaking trial juice.
>
> Sam: I don't know.
>
> Dean: Well, what else would it be?
>
> Sam: Why does it have to be something else? It's always something else. We're always scraping to find some other explanation <u>when maybe it is... just me</u>.
>
> Dean: Oh, come on, Sam.
>
> Sam: <u>I'm a mess, Dean. You know it. And sometimes, I feel like maybe I'm never gonna actually be all right.</u>
>
> Dean: You will. All right, 'cause whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
>
> Sam: <u>Or this is... just the way I am.</u>
>
> <u>[Dean closes his eyes in resignation. He shakes his head and goes to sit next to his brother.]</u>
>
> Dean: <u>I can't. I can't let you put this on yourself. Listen to me. It's not you, Sam.</u>

> Sam: (in faux FBI-colleague voice, smiling) “Agent.”
>
> Castiel: (pleased to be in on the game with the lads) Agent.
>
> Dean: (cutting in, no fun at all) Cass. What the hell are you doing?
>
> Castiel: Um, (sotto voce) I still have that badge you gave me.
>
> Dean: Yeah. Uh, what the hell are you doing?
>
> Castiel: The murders were all over the news. I, I thought I might be of help.
>
> Sam: Yeah, but Cass, you know that this is an angel situation, right? I mean, you left that night because angels were on your ass.
>
> Dean: (uncomfortable, interjects) Yeah, and you were living the life, you know? Early retirement, working your way up the Gas-n-Sip ladder.
>
> Castiel: If angels are slaughtering one another, I have to do what I can to help. It is a risk we should be willing to take, don't you think? (Sam shrugs in agreement, seeing the point.) <u>Hey. Cass is back in town.</u>
>
> Dean: Seriously, did you – (to Sam) did he just say that?

> Castiel: It is so good being together again. <u>You know, this is my first beer as a human. I hope it's okay, me joining you?</u>
>
> Sam: Why wouldn't it be okay?
>
> Dean: (looks alarmed at this turn of the conversation) You know, Cass, are you sure you're ready to jump back into all this? I mean, it seemed to me like you'd actually found some peace.
>
> Castiel: Hey, you once told me that you don't choose what you do. It chooses you.
>
> Dean: Huh?
>
> Castiel: I'm a part of this. (clinks beer bottles with Dean) Like it or not.
>
> Sam: All right, well, then, in that case, we have to figure out, uh, who are we up against, what do they want, and how do we stop them.
>
> Castiel: Well, Bartholomew wants to reverse Metatron's spell. Presumably to – to retake Heaven once his following is large enough. That's according to April.
>
> Dean: The reaper you banged.
>
> Castiel: Yeah, and you stabbed.
>
> Dean: Yeah. (awkward pause) She was hot.
>
> Castiel: <u>So hot. And very nice.</u>
>
> Dean: (appreciatively) Mm.
>
> Castiel: Up to the point she started torturing me.
>
> Dean: Yeah. Well, not every hookup's perfect. (Dean pats Castie's arm companionably.)
>
> Sam: (smiling at the exchange) All right. I'm gonna get us another round.
>
> Castiel: Nah. I'll get it. (Castiel hops off his bar stool, then returns.) Mm. (swigging the last of his old beer, and setting the bottle on the table.) You know, I've never done this before.
>
> Dean: (sighs) One beer, he's hammered.

> Castiel: (clears throat) <u>I, um, I noticed you look... kind of uncomfortable whenever Sam mentions my leaving. Doesn't he know that you told me to leave?</u>
>
> Dean: Here's the deal. When Sam was doing the trials to seal up Hell, it messed him up. Okay? The third one nearly killed him. If I'd let him finish, it would have. He's still messed up, bad.
>
> Castiel: You said the angel, Ezekiel, helped heal him.
>
> Dean: (looks down, avoiding the question) Look, I got to do anything I can to get him back. Now, if that means that we keep our distance from you for a little while, then... Then I don't have a choice. I don't feel good about it, but I don't have a choice. It's great to have your help, Cass. Okay, but we just can't work together.
>
> <u>Cass looks sad.</u>

> Castiel is kneeling.
>
> Castiel: (exhales) Okay.
>
> Castiel: (kneels beside the bed, closes his eyes, and folds his hands in prayer) <u>I'm... unfamiliar with this end of the process.</u> Of course, no one may be listening, um, but I – I do need assistance.
>
> Castiel: (sits on the bed in lotus position, legs folded, arms extended, thumb and forefinger touching) I have questions, and there seem to be no answers.
>
> Castiel: (kneeling prostrate on the floor) I... I wouldn't presume to ask for help if I weren't desperate, but I need help.
>
> Castiel: (standing upright, eyes closed, arms extended, palms upward) I'm lost.

> Castiel: (lying on the bed, legs bent, feet down, hands over his eyes) I need your guidance.
>
> Castiel: (kneeling, hands folded, eyes closed) Please hear my prayer.

> Castiel: I don't know how humans do it.

> Giving up for now, Castiel walks over to the TV, and tries to turn it on. It seems unresponsive.

> Theo walks and shuts the door, then returns to Castiel, and picks up a drill.
>
> Theo: I'll give you one last chance for this to end.
>
> Castiel: <u>Give me a quick death.</u>
>
> Castiel closes his eyes and holds up his face in anticipation of the blow(s).
>
> Theo: I need you to speak to Metatron. Everyone knows you have influence.
>
> <u>Castiel now opens his eyes and looks in astonishment at Theo.</u>
>
> Theo: (continuing) He'll listen to you. Ask him to raise me to Heaven. You can do this, Castiel. I'll be a soldier for Metatron, do anything he wants.
>
> Castiel: You – you serve Malachi.
>
> Theo: I thought he was the answer, but he's crazy.
>
> Castiel: You're... noticing this now? You were more than willing to do his dirty work.
>
> Theo: I did what I had to.
>
> Castiel: When you were sure he would defeat Bartholomew.
>
> Theo: But no one will survive this war.
>
> Castiel: So, you prefer to sit it out in Heaven.
>
> Theo: I can talk to him about restoring your grace.
>
> Castiel: <u>(calculating) Well, it's, um, it's true. Metatron and I do have a working relationship.</u>
>
> Theo: (smiles) I knew it!
>
> Castiel: You're clever, Theo.
>
> Theo: You're allies.
>
> Castiel: And he could use a skilled soldier like yourself. <u>(Castiel pretends to reconsider.)</u> Oh, but I don't know.
>
> Theo: I-I'm a team player, Castiel.
>
> Castiel: All right. Well? (gestures at his manacles; Theo opens them up)
>
> Castiel: I'll – I'll need a moment to make contact. (Theo waits.) And you have something that I'll need.
>
> Theo: Anything.
>
> Castiel grabs one of the medical implements and slices Theo in the throat, letting his white grace slip out; Castiel opens his mouth and swallows it.
>
> Castiel: Mm. (Castiel groans; the grace fills him up; his eyes turn blue; Theo stares in dazed recrimination, blood dripping from his neck. Castiel looks at him, then puts a hand to his forehead; Theo screams, his angelic white light bursts out of him, and he falls to the ground his eyes burned out.)
