> Hannah walks away as Castiel looks at the pictures on the wall. As she's walking Hannah removes her suit jacket and hangs it on a hook on the wall.
>
> Castiel: The best lead we have. Until we find something stronger, we should...
>
> Hannah is undressing as Castiel talks. As he turns back to face her she drops her shirt. The camera view is from behind Hannah so we see her naked back and Castiel facing her from across the room with a surprised look on his face.
>
> Castiel: ... uh... check it out.
>
> <u>Castiel is trying to NOT look at Hannah.</u>
>
> Castiel: Hannah?
>
> Hannah: Yes?
>
> Castiel: What are you doing?
>
> Hannah: I'm taking a shower.
>
> Castiel: Um... We don't need to shower.
>
> Hannah: I know. (Hannah looks confused by Castiel's reaction) Are you -- Does this bother you?
>
> Castiel: <u>Bothered? I... I'm not.</u>
>
> Hannah: (smirks) Good.
>
> Hannah turns to enter the bathroom. A door closes and we hear water running.

> Castiel: What's going on?
>
> Hannah: I'm sorry, Castiel. I'm not going with you. I'm done.
>
> Scene changes to Hannah and Castiel walking on a path along the stream.
>
> Hannah: It's hard letting go... of a story, a mission. But what of the humans whose lives we sacrifice in the name of that mission?
>
> Castiel: What of them?
>
> Hannah: We always said the humans were our original mission. Maybe it's time, Castiel -- time to put them first.
>
> Castiel: Where is all this coming from?
>
> Hannah: <u>Being on earth, working with you, I've felt things. Human things -- passions, hungers. To shower, feel water on my skin... to get closer to you.</u> But all of that was nothing compared to what I felt when I saw him.
>
> Hannah: Her husband -- his anger and his grief. And Caroline was inside of me, screaming out for him, for her life back. These f-feelings, they aren't for me, for us. They belong to her. I know it's time to step aside.
>
> Hannah smiles, leans forward and kisses Castiel on the cheek. Castiel nods.
>
> Hannah: Goodbye, Castiel.

> Claire: So do I, Castiel. My dad... Is he still in there?
>
> Castiel: <u>No.</u> The human soul, it can only occupy a body while it retains a certain... structural integrity, and <u>this vessel, it was... It was ripped apart on a subatomic level by an archangel</u>.
>
> Claire: Well, then how are you...?
>
> Castiel: <u>I was reassembled.</u> Your father is in Heaven.

> Sandra: So... Mr. Novak. I understand you want custody of your daughter.
>
> Castiel: Yes, that's uh --
>
> <u>Cass clears his throat, makes his voice less gruff-sounding.</u>
>
> Castiel: That's right.
>
> Sandra: Why?
>
> Castiel: Excuse me?
>
> Sandra: It's a simple question. You vanish, for years. No contact, not even a Christmas card. Why come back now?
>
> Castiel: I, um... I didn't, uh... I was traveling.
>
> Claire: For work.
>
> Castiel: Work. Yes.
>
> Sandra: Long trip. And what is it that you do exactly?
>
> Castiel: <u>I... uh... I fight certain deadly threats to humanity.</u>
>
> Claire: He's an exterminator.
>
> Castiel: I'm an exterminator.
>
> From the look on her face, it's obvious Sandra doesn't believe their story.

> Claire: Ketchup's a vegetable.
>
> Cass gives her a look like he's not quite sure whether to believe her or not, and she laughs.
>
> Claire: <u>You've changed. The Castiel I met? He was crappy. Like super stuck-up and a dick and you just wanted to punch him in his stupid angel face.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>I don't think I was THAT bad.</u>
>
> Claire: You totally were. And now you're just... I don't know. Nicer. And kind of a doof. No offense.
>
> Castiel: Yes, well, um... Before, I was very self-assured. I was convinced I was on this righteous path. Now I realize that there is no righteous path. <u>It's just people trying to do their best in a world where it's far too easy to do your worst.</u>
>
> Claire: Wow. Deep.
>
> Castiel: Yeah. For a doof.
>
> Claire smiles, and the waitress walks up, giving Castiel the check.
>
> Castiel: Thank you. So... where do we go next?
>
> Claire: Look. I appreciate the meal. And, you know, the felony. But you don't need to babysit me. I can take care of myself.
>
> Castiel: What do you mean?
>
> Claire: I mean you felt guilty, so you busted me out. So thanks, but we're good. Even Steven.
>
> Castiel: No, we um... We committed a crime, and you might need me again. So I -- I think we should stick together.
>
> Claire: Okay. You want to get some stuff for the road? I have to pee.
>
> Castiel: Oh. Okay.

> Outside, Claire takes the hood off her head, then starts walking away.
>
> Castiel: Claire, wait!
>
> Claire: Screw you.
>
> Dean: Whoa, hey, Miley Cyrus. Settle.
>
> Claire: Eat me, Hasselhoff.
>
> Sam: Claire, hold on a second. Look, my name's --
>
> Claire: Sam. And you're Dean. We've met, remember?
>
> Castiel: Claire. You were going to rob that convenience store?
>
> Claire: So?
>
> Castiel: "So?" So... it's -- it's wrong!
>
> Claire: <u>You want to talk to me about wrong? You killed my dad. Is that "wrong" enough for you?</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>No, I didn't.</u>
>
> Claire: Really? Because without you, he'd still be here. And my mom would still be around.
>
> Castiel: Claire, I'm --
>
> He takes a step towards her, and she pulls the gun from her pocket, cocking it and pointing it at him.
>
> Claire: Don't!
>
> Castiel: That won't hurt me.
>
> Claire: Fine.
>
> Claire turns the gun on Sam and Dean, who both take a step back.
>
> Dean: Whoa! Hey, come on.
>
> Sam: Hold on a second.
>
> Claire: Why? <u>Like you don't have it coming? You stood there while this monster took my dad.</u>
>
> She puts the gun down, then turns to Cass.
>
> Claire: <u>I used to pray to you, Castiel. Every night. I would beg you to bring him home safe.</u>
>
> Castiel: <u>I know.</u>
>
> Claire: You know... <u>My father was a good man. In what messed up world does he have to die and you get to live?</u>
>
> Castiel: I'm sorry.
>
> Claire: <u>No. You feel guilty. There's a difference.</u>
>
> Sam: So what? Now you run back to Randy? The guy you steal for?
>
> Claire: How do you know about that?
>
> Dean: Dustin.
>
> Castiel: Claire, that man is using you.
>
> Claire: He was there for me. When things got bad -- and they got REAL damn bad -- he was there when no one else was. HE'S my family. And you're just... you can go to hell.
>
> Claire walks away, leaving Cass watching after her.

> Sam, Dean, and Castiel stand outside the restaurant Castiel and Claire were at the previous night.
>
> Dean: This is why you called us? THIS is your emergency?
>
> Castiel: Yes!
>
> Dean: No, Cass! An emergency is a dead body, okay? Or -- or a wigged-out angel, or the Apocalypse, take three. Some chick bolting on you is not an emergency. That's... that's every Friday night for Sam.
>
> Sam: Dude.
>
> Dean: Well.
>
> Castiel: This isn't just "some chick." I'm responsible for her.
>
> Dean: Since when? You met her once, how many years ago?
>
> Sam: Look, Cass. Even if we do find Claire... Then what?
>
> Dean: She rolled you, and then she ran, okay? It's pretty clear that she doesn't want to play house.
>
> Castiel: I understand. But I need to know that Claire is safe. And I need your help.
>
> Sam: All right. Uh... Why don't we go ask around at the group home?
>
> Dean: Uh, you know what? We're going to stick here in case she circles back. You go ahead.
>
> Castiel: Thank you.

> Inside the restaurant, Castiel is studying a ketchup bottle intently.
>
> Castiel: Is ketchup a vegetable?
>
> Dean: Hell, yes. All right, so spill. What's with the family reunion?
>
> Castiel: I don't know. I've just been... thinking about people. <u>(Dean glances around, then switches their plates, taking Cass' burger and setting his empty plate in front of Cass)</u> No problem. I've helped some, but I've... I've hurt some.
>
> Dean: So you're having a midlife crisis.
>
> Castiel: Well, <u>I'm extremely old. I think I'm entitled.</u>
>
> Dean: Cass, listen to me. There's some stuff you just got to let go. Okay? The people you let down, the ones you can't save... You got to forget about them. For your own good.
>
> Castiel: Is that what you do?
>
> Dean: That's the opposite of what I do. But I ain't exactly a role model.
>
> Castiel: That's not true.
>
> Dean looks at Cass, then laughs, clearly not believing him.
>
> Dean: Yeah.

> Dean: Cass, I need you to promise me something.
>
> Castiel: Of course.
>
> Dean: <u>If I do go dark side, you got to take me out.</u>
>
> Castiel: What do you mean?
>
> Dean: Knife me. Smite me. Throw me into the freakin' sun, whatever. And don't let Sam get in the way, because he'll try. I can't go down that road again, man. I can't be that thing again.

> Sam: Hey, uh... Tell him about that time in New York.
>
> Dean: Oh yeah. Yeah, okay. So, uh... We were working this haunting in Long Island, and me and Sam begged the old man to let us go to the city for once.
>
> Sam: He had this thing about New York, right? Too big, too loud, too dirty.
>
> Dean: Yeah, and he hated the Yankees.
>
> Sam: Big time.
>
> Dean: Somehow, we convince him to let us go. So, we all go. We all, you know, see all the sights, and uh, ride the subway, eat too much pizza. The whole nine. Well, by about midnight, Sam and Dad are zonked, and I figure... Screw it. I'm going to CBGB.
>
> Sam: So CBGB is --
>
> Castiel: I know. It's where The Ramones and Blondie got their start.
>
> Sam looks to Dean, both of them taken aback.
>
> Dean: Right.
>
> Sam: Wow. Anyways, he was WAY underage at the time.
>
> Dean: All right, so I get there. I sneak in, and it is nuts. I mean, people are drinking and they're smoking and they're -- they're snorting whatever. There's a five-hundred pound guy on stage with a Mohawk just screaming. And, uh, my mind is blown. I don't even know what to do. Then this girls walks up and she says "Hey, why don't you come over and sit down with me and my friends at our table?" All right!
>
> Sam: Yeah, and they get him drunk. First time.
>
> Dean: But not fun drunk. I'm not quite sure what was in that stuff, but the room starts to spin, and I feel like I'm going to puke... forever. And right about that time, I hear him. "Dean Winchester!"
>
> Cass looks confused, but Sam just smiles.
>
> Dean: My old man. I don't know how, but he found me. And now I'm really freaking out, because he's just standing there, not saying anything. <u>I look around, and everybody else is freaking out, too. In fact, nobody's even looking him in the eye. And finally, this one guy with, like, a safety pin through his nose and a -- a "Kill Everything" tattoo looks up and he says, "Sorry, sir."</u>
>
> Cass smiles, and Dean shakes his head.
>
> Dean: Yeah. "Sorry, sir." To John friggin' Winchester.
>
> He and Sam take a sip of their whiskey, while Cass throws his back like a shot.
>
> Castiel: He saved you.
>
> Dean: Yeah, and you know what he got for that? Me whining about how much he embarrassed me. Me telling him that I hated him. But then he stopped and turned around and he looked at me and he said, "Son, you don't like me? That's fine. It's not my job to be liked."
>
> Sam: "It's my job to raise you right."
>
> Dean: Yeah. And he did.

Crowley：亲妈真让人头大
