# （1）主线

## Playing for time 黑梦

Don't trust that Takemura. Meet with him, sure, check him out, but keep your eyes open. He's a corporat, meaning he's looking to use you.

## Automatic Love 高级动物

So you've decided to find the chick who put on this first-class shitshow. She had a job and you took it 'cause there was no one else to knock some sense into your gonk head. I'm here now, but so what? This search and rescue bullshit's a dead end, but that's not about to stop you. Maybe Evelyn will, who knows? Sure seems like she doesn't wanna be found. 

## The Space in Between 垃圾场

If I've learned one thing from joyhouses, it's to quit while the going's good. Stare at those fake smiles too long, and all you'll see is misery. As far as clubs go they're all pretty pathetic, but at least it's in their own way. You know the chances of finding Evelyn are close to zilch, right? Like that's gonna change your mind... Anyway, let's go pay a visit to this so-called Fingers. But if we don't find Parker, you owe me a drink.

逛窑子这种事情我有经验，讲究的是爽完了拉倒。她们脸上的假笑看多了，你就会觉得特别悲催。只要是夜总会，那就全都一个样，无非是各人有各人的凄惨。找到艾芙琳的可能性约等于零，这你应该知道吧？反正你也不会改主意……好了，咱们去会会这个所谓的指头哥。不过要是找不着帕克，那你就得请我喝酒。

## Disasterpiece 祸不单行

Every city's got its shady neighborhoods and "no-go" zones. Stepping into these areas in Night City is like wading into the abyss and feeling it stare back through your soul. Anyone with an ounce of sense avoids these haunts altogether. Your average gonk's usually seen limping out, bleeding from one or more places. And you, V? Just make sure you come out intact.

## Double Life 两生花

There's nothing you can't take away from a person - you just gotta look hard enough. When all options are exhausted, you've still got a body that can be harvested, skills that can be put to good use... Oh, and let's not forget "dignity" - that's a classic. Hell, I'm starting to think I could've done worse than end up on this little Relic of yours.

一个人的身上没有什么东西是不能夺走的。就看你有没有开动脑筋。哪怕什么都没了，不是还有身体可以出卖，还有看家的本事可以利用吗? 哦，当然也别忘了“尊严”，那可是压轴戏。哼，我都开始觉得，要不是困在了你的这个Relic里，我的下场说不定会更惨。

## M'ap Tann Pèlen

Well, we know the Voodoo Boys were behind all this, so that's one step forward. Problem is, now we have to reach them somehow - two steps back. There are a lot of things to be found in Pacifica, just usually not what you're looking for. Good news is you already got your fixer: a man without a face to help you find this fart in the wind. Sounds like a fun fuckin' delight.

## I Walk the Line 勇往直前

I'm sick of this Placide motherfucker as much as you, but at least the fog has lifted, the goal is clear. You find a netrunner in the GIM and the Voodoo goons will set up a meet-n-greet with their queen. Pros? Maybe I'll actually get to see a legit netrunner, 'cause it's sure starting to feel like an extinct species these days. Someone who's got the guts to square off against the Voodoos has given me some hope, at least. But the cons? Damn near any minute your brain could start dripping out your ears. Afraid we won't have time to make pilgrimmages to the monuments of Pacifica's Golden Age.

## Never Fade Away 永不消逝【强尼】

You get nightmares, don't you V? The stubborn kind that keep coming back, night after night, like they wanna make sure you never forget a single detail, sight or touch? The kind where you can barely breathe because you know what comes next?

You ever get those? I know you do. So here - welcome to mine.

V，你会做噩梦吗? 那种挥之不去的噩梦，一个晚上接着一个晚上不停地重复，就好像它想让你记住每一个细节、每一个眼神、每一次碰触。在梦里你几乎无法呼吸，因为你知道接下来会发生什么。

你做过这种梦吗? 我知道你做过。好了：欢迎进入我的梦。

## Ghost Town 死城【赫尔曼】

Wanna track down Hellman? Start at the Afterlife. Sure, the place has changed over the years, but one thing never will: you got a question you just can't shake, head to The Afterlife. Always someone there to whisper the answer in your ear... for the right price. And if that someone's Rogue – shit, I wouldn't miss this meet for the world.

Just when you think you've solved your problem, your solution goes and starts making fucking demands. Looks like Panam'll only scratch your back if you scratch hers. Could've expected that, coming from a nomad. Know what, though? I've got a good feeling about this sand-swept desert dame. Let's see where our newfound friendship takes us. Preferably to that weasely fuck, Hellman.

## Lightning Breaks 拉闸【赫尔曼】

Panam Palmer. Gotta say, I like her. Girl's got a pair - and clearly a plan, too. Let's see if it's enough to grab Hellman. Honestly, V, never thought I'd ride with the nomads again. I know, I know she left the Aldecaldos, but you can feel it too, can't you? Clan's in her blood and bones. In her heart. Don't think she'll let us down.

## Down on the Street 荒街老友【竹村】

If someone told me I'd be taking calls from Saburo Arasaka's fucking bodyguard, I'd have laughed in their face. And now we're supposed to meet with some Takemura? Hand over all our detes? I'm not even gonna pretend like this is a good idea. But fuck it - sometimes you just gotta go all in.

## Gimme Danger 危险游戏【竹村】

Our crazed ronin shows no signs of slowing his roll. We barely get intel from Wakako about the parade and Takemura's already hatching some hairbraned scheme in Japantown. He wants to meet at the market? Fine, let's parley, but you already know where I stand. Don't let him strong-arm you into anything. Who knows how many loose screws are bouncing around that skull at this points...

## Play It Safe 虎口拔牙【竹村】

Since I wasn't invited to Saburo Arasaka's funeral, I guess this sad little parade will have to do - I'm just missing confetti. But in all seriousness, Takemura must have a death wish. He's just gonna jump onto Hanako's platform? Be my fucking guest - we'll deal with the snipers. Meanwhile, keep an eye out for an escape route. This gonna go all kinds of wrong - I can feel it.

## Search and Destroy 303号房【竹村】

Know what my downside is? No matter how much I might want to, I don't fucking make mistakes. Lo and behold! Our factory-reset ronin, hounded by every single Arasaka soldier in Night City for KIDNAPPING Saburo Arasaka's daughter. Kudos to him - I couldn't've fucked this plan up better myself. And after all this he STILL wants you to drop by? I don't know who's more whacked - him or us. Just remember to knock four times. His head, preferably - against a fucking table.

# （2）结局

## Nocturne Op55N1 夜曲

We both knew this time would come. If we don't think of something quick, you will die - and I'll go with you. It's time for our final meeting.

## 恶魔结局

### Last Caress 最后的温情【华子】

That's all, folks! Little Johnny can go to sleep while the grown-ups fix their big ol' mess. All I know's that you cut a deal with Arasaka - you help Hanako knock Yorinobu off his pedestal in return for help with the Relic. You already know where I stand. You've got better things to dream about than a rockerboy's mad ravings. Just make sure this little dream of yours doesn't turn into a nightmare.

### Totalimmortal 手足相残【华子】

Go to hell, V. You're on your own, got that? Stage is all yours. I'll just stand in the wings and watch you meet certain death, 'cause that's how this little coup against Yorinobu is gonna end. That is, unless our porcelain doll's got any aces up her sleeve. But if things go south, just jump out the window. Don't give them the satisfaction - don't let the fuckers take you alive.

Well I'll be a corporat on a stick. Yorinobu tried to take out the entire Arasaka board in one fell swoop. I'd buy the gonk a beer if I could. No doubt, the sight of Arasakas lunging at each other's throat is a thing of beauty, but it kinda throws a wrench in our plans. Now you gotta take care of Yorinobu on Hanako's terms. Looks like Lil Sis is done playing around - crazy Big Bro's gonna give up Arasaka tower one way or the other. Still, isn't it weird that we're not allowed to hurt a hair on his pretty little head after he marked her for DEATH? Maybe Hanako wants to "neutralize" him herself? One thing's for sure - the path to Yorinobu's office leads through a lot of levels... and a LOT of bodies.

## 星星结局

### We Gotta Live Together 风暴前夕【帕南】

I was gonna say that this time you'd have to go it alone, but it looks like the Aldecaldos've got some fight in them after all. Wonder what you see in them: a partner? Friend? Family? Something tells me sooner or later you're gonna have to choose one of the above, especially if it's thanks to them you get into Mikoshi.

我本来以为这次你只能靠自己了，可没想到阿德卡多还插有爷们儿的。不知道你怎么看他们: 伙伴? 朋友? 还是家人? 我有种预感，你迟早会从中做出选择。特别是多亏了他们把你弄进神舆之后。

### Forward to Death 期待死亡【帕南】

Last stop on the line. Little does the corp know that this train's not going back. It's a shame I won't be there with you, 'cuz it's looking to be one helluva ride. But hey, that's what family's for, right? Anyway, once you get to the Arasaka sublevels, that crater filled with chrome and concrete, just take a second to remember that Johnny was there. Then mow down anyone in your way and get to Mikoshi.

“终点站到了，终点站到了。”公司里没几个人知道这是条单程线。只可惜我没法一起参加，因为路上肯定很过瘾。不过，谁叫你们是一家人呢，对吧? 总之，你进入荒坂地下层的时候，就是那个尽是义体和混凝土的弹坑，一定别忘了，强尼以前也来过。然后把所有挡路的都干掉，直接杀进神舆。

### Belly of the Beast 野兽之腹【帕南】

You're almost there, V. In the heart of fucking darkness. Can you feel it? You're so close to the moment of goddamn truth. And I'm right there with you. Still. Always. Even if I'm just a blacked-out passenger in the backseat. Whatever you do, do it for us. At the very least, that's what I'm fucking counting on.

快了，V。你能感受到吗? 就在这团操蛋的黑暗中央。你就快他妈接近真相了。而我会和你同在。仍然会。一直会。哪怕我只是个晕在后座的乘客。不管你做什么，把我那份也算上。最最起码，我他妈是这么指望的。

### All Along the Watchtower 沿着瞭望塔【帕南】

So you decided to ditch the City of Dreams - start anew, start fresh. I went through a few fresh starts in my life, too. And you know what? Don't regret a damn thing. You won't either. Give my regards to the South. And when you hear Johnny's voice, go ahead and smile, but don't bother to answer. It'll just be a voice on the radio recorded long ago, a fading reproduction, a flickering memory. You'll be someone completely different. Take care, V.

这么说你决定逃离逐梦之城。重新开始，展望新生。我也经历过几次新生。知道我学到什么了吗? 千万别他妈后悔。当然你也不会后悔。替我向南边问个好。当你听到强尼的声音时，一定要保持微笑向前看，甭费心思多想。那就是很久以前电台里录的，一道淡去的回声，一段闪现的回忆。你会成为一个完全不同的人。保重，V。

## 节制结局

### New Dawn Fades 镜子中

Every story has its end. And let me tell you V, I never thought yours would mean anything but mine, too. But... here I am. Still alive and still kicking. For the first time in fifty long, long years.

If you're out there somewhere - and I think you are - take a look at me now.

每个故事都有它的结局。实话告诉你吧，V，我从没想过你的结局会和我有什么关系，我的也一样。可是……我就在这里。仍然活蹦乱跳的。这还是漫长的五十年来头一次。

如果你在什么地方，我一直觉得你在，请你现在看看我。

# （3）支线任务

## 黑拳

### Beat on the Brat: The Glen 谷地区

Time for another rumble - this time in the Glen. I'd put money on their champ being a Valentino. Yeah, I can see him now: two golden fists and a machete across his back... y'know, in case things get dicey and take a turn for the unsportsmanlike.

### Beat on the Brat: Pacifica 太平州

A throwdown in Pacifica, huh? Wonder who you're up again. I'd say a Haitian, though I guess that much is probably obvious. Careful, those Pacificans don't fight for first blood - they fight for last blood.

### Beat on the Brat: Arroyo 河谷

Heard somewhere the champ of Arroyo is a grade-A prick. Good news - should make beatin' his ass all the more fun.

### Beat on the Brat: Rancho Coronado 科罗纳多农场

A fight in an Animals' club? Oof... feel sorry for you, I do. These guys play hard, V. It won't be easy... and it won't be fun.

### Beat on the Brat: Kabuki 歌舞伎区

Don't overthink this one. You have to defeat the champion of Kabuki. You know the stakes, you know the place. Now get your ass over there and win.

### Beat on the Brat 拳霸

You're gettin' noticed, V. People can sense that hunger in you - one that can't be satiated. You want everything right now, and if you don't it...  you fight for it. You're a warrior, V. And the warrior's place is in the ring. Show 'em what you're made of. Knock the bolts off this training bot. And then, well... we'll see.

## 心中困兽【克莱尔】

### The Beast in Me: Badlands 恶土

So, you're waiting for a date with Claire and her turbo-charged pet, Beast, away from all the city's hustle and bustle. I wonder how many bodies have been left to the bake in the Badlands sun after these races? Just do a me a favor and don't become one. Watch out for tumbleweeds, bumpy patches... armored Wraith trucks... Y'know, the usual.

### The Beast in Me: City Center 市政中心

It's time to find out what really revs Claire's engine, huh? First face of the circuit takes you through the heart of Night City. Back in my time, people who won races like this could count on free drinks for a lifetime. So, y'know... not real long. But still.

### The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo 圣多明戈

Ah, Santo Domingo! The eternal fountain of shit where the only sure thing was you'd eventually step on the toes of some hot-blooded jarhead with "6th Street" tatooed on his ass. You win this race, V, you show them who's in charge around here. You got a good shot too - I don't see this Claire slowing down until she reaches the finals.

### The Beast in Me: The Big Race 生死大赛

What now, V? Gonna help Claire stick it to the corpos who offed her husband? Or are you just hunting for that top spot on the podium? You know what I'd do if it were my call, but it's your hands on the wheel, not mine. You know... Claire's not so bad, after all. Kinda feel sorry for her actually. But like I said - your call. Good luck out there, turbo.

### The Beast In Me 心中困兽

No one in Night City is only one layer deep. Take Claire for example - an Afterlife bartender who likes to burn rubber in illegal street races when she's on break. If you get the itch for a little adrenaline, I think you can snatch it at her garage.

## 回家的路【德拉曼】

### Epistrophy: Badlands 恶土

Over the mountains, through the woods, nestled on the hills beyond North Oak - that's where your pal Delamain lost one of his cabs. He's a goddamn talking car himself and, apparently, has more cars of his own. I dunno, but I just say we continue this little fairy tale, find that cab, save the princess and claim half the kingdom.

### Epistrophy: The Glen 谷地区

Ahh, the Glen. You know this used to be a college campus? Some thought that taking out colossal loans and enrolling in a biotech degree would make their lives better. Then the harsh reality kicked in - it was easier to throw yourself off a bridge than get into a corporate research lab. Makes you wonder why our rogue Delamain cab chose this place of all places.

### Epistrophy: Wellsprings 美泉区

Head to Wellsprings to find one of Delamain's missing vehicles. Or go save yourself from impending death. Up to you.

### Epistrophy: Coastview 海景区

Ever been to Coastview? Not too shabby. Had an output from there once. Sure, maybe she liked to wheeze, jab, pop and snort a little too much, but who wasn't in those days? Her name was Amanda or Amelie or something, I don't remember. Remind me to tell you the shooting range story sometime.

### Epistrophy: Rancho Coronado 科罗纳多农场

Never been a fan of Rancho Coronado, personally. If you really gotta find a cab out there, just do it quick and get back into the city, OK?

### Epistrophy: Northside 北区

I kinda like this Delamain. He's comfortable in his own code, not ashamed to be a talking car. He's asked you to find one of his rides in Northside, so I say we do him a favor.

### Epistrophy: North Oak 北巷区

A taxi in distress calls for a hero like you, V. If you want to become a legend, set out on this quest for ultimate glory. The Afterlife awaits!

### Epistrophy 回家的路

Cars didn't talk back in my day, and now this one wants to give you a job? What a time to be alive... What're you waiting for?

## Badlands

### Following the River 爱似河【瑞弗】

The Peter Pan case is done and closed, so you do know you never have to see this badge again... right? OK, fine, I get it, you crawled through shit and fire together, and now you wanna kick back and celebrate your victory. But a family dinner? Fuckin' seriously? Can't just find a decent dive to grab a tequila or ten? Smash the bottle over some corpocunt's face? You're getting soft, V.

### I'll Fly Away 飞翔鸟【蝎子】

Something about corpses draws you to their unfinished biz, V. First, it was me... now Scorpion. Mitch wants you to fulfill his final request. Gotta admit it's got my curiosity piqued, but hey, as a dead guy, I'm biased.

你这个人啊，一看见尸体就想帮他们完成未了的心事。先是我……现在又是蝎子。米契要你去实现蝎子的遗愿。我得承认，这激起了我的好奇心。不过你也不能怪我，毕竟大家都是死人嘛。

### KOLD MIRAGE 冰柜里的神迹【巴特莫斯】

Always somethin' interesting to be found at the dump. Take a half-dead, half-brain merc with an experimental chip in their head for example. Or, in this case, a freezer from 2020... a glimpse into the past.

### Meetings Along The Edge 麻木的迷醉【禅学大师】

Ok, this Zen master guy of yours is literally everywhere. He's gonna fall ass first out of your fridge tomorrow. This meditation's doing the trick for you? Listen, if it's the whole poetic aspect of it, I understand. But in that case just throw on one of my albums, dig into the lyrics, and leave this scam artist out of it.

### Pyramid Song 金字塔之歌【朱迪】

Everyone knows you can't just count on yourself in this goddamn city. You always gotta have a few chooms who owe you a favor. And a few you've got dirt on too. But when you've got the kind of choom who starts asking you for weirder and weirder shit? That's when problems start.

### Riders on the Storm 冲破风暴【帕南】

OK, this must actually be pretty serious. Tough chick like Panam wouldn't call you up for some chump chore. Must be something important. Wouldn't waste any time on this one if I were you. To the Aldecaldos' camp we go.

### These Boots Are Made for Walkin' 失而复得

Here you thought your old ride was totaled for good - yet here you are now. Like a phoenix from the ashes, it lives again. But how? Why now? You'd already closed that chapter of kickin' up sand with nomads out in the desert... But I mean, it'd be stupid if you didn't check it out... right? You never can underestimate the past. Because it sure as shit likes to take revenge.

### With a Little Help from My Friends 举手之劳【帕南】

The great nomad saga continues: Panam's up to something. That girl just doesn't know when to quit - and my God, I love her for it. You don't seem to know either, considering you wanna go back out there. Maybe you could save us all some time, pitch a tent out in the desert? Think we both know this isn't just about the job anymore.

伟大的流浪者传奇继续上演：帕南又不知道在打些什么鬼主意。这姑娘真是一刻都不得闲。要命，我爱死她了。你不是想回去吗？我看你也跟她差不多。要么干脆别浪费大家时间了，在沙漠里扎个帐篷岂不是更好？我想咱们都清楚，醉翁之意不在酒。

## City Center

### Boat Drinks 火与酒【克里】

The marina, huh? Wonder what Kerry's got up his sleeve this time. Maybe he wants to get rid of someone - toss their body parts in the bay. Or maybe he just wants an audience while he waxes poetic about yachts over shrimp cocktails. Oh well, he's your problem now. Not mine.

### Bullets 砧板上的肉

Looks like there's some justice in the world after all. My little merc wants to play dress-up like a corpo, then all the sudden a cyberpsycho kicks down the shop's door. Coincidence? Sure, probably, but a fuckin' delightful one. I hope you learn a valuable lesson today. That is, if you survive 'til the end of it.

### Imagine 想象【禅学大师】

In Night City, there's no shortage of gonks, hustlers and just plain assholes. And if you stopped to talk to each one, you might just cross the last of your wires, too. But if that's what your gut's tellin' you to do, by all means. Just watch for sticky fingers.

## Heywood

### Don't Lose Your Mind/I Can See Clearly Now 不要迷失自我【德拉曼】

Your buddy Delamain appears to be having some personal issues. How else do you explain his cabs standing in the middle of the road and blocking traffic? better give him a call. Besides, you're short on friends (present imaginary company excluded).

### Heroes 再见杰克【杰克】

I don't usually give advice, but... fuck it, here goes. Don't make the same mistake I made - say goodbye to the people you love. You know what I mean, right? Jackie Welles was your best choom, and you don't find a lot of straight-up peeps like that in NC. Best thing you can is remember them. Oh, and one more thing. If anyone asks, I didn't just say all that to you. Got it?

### I Fought the Law 向法律宣战【杰佛逊】

Initial entry:
Look, if a job starts like a classic whodunit - some femme fatale calls you up, refuses to give deets and just calls a meet - one of three things is going down: you're dreaming, you're scrollin' a shit BD or someone's hazing you good. Think you can scratch the first two.

Later entry:
First rule of "top secret" jobs - don't take 'em.
First rule of working with politicians - don't do it.
First rule of contacting the police - avoid it.
And what do you do? Break 'em all at once. Gotta say, V, I'm a little impressed.

### Only Pain 愧而为人

"To serve and protect..." Funny, would've thought "To extort and torture" might fit better. Not sure what this guy's beef is with badges, but if you don't step in, they'll be scrapin' him off the sidewalk. Once they smear him there first, of course. But I dunno... maybe it's for the best? After all, no one's in Night City's dyin' an innocent soul.

### Raymond Chandler Evening 外遇

Usually it's the customers spillin' the ugly personal stories to the bartender, yet there we were, seeing it the other way around. Pepe thinks his wife is cheating on him and he's looking for someone to confirm his worst suspicions. Classic. A cuckold, a beautiful woman, a city shrouded in darkness... Get the feeling I've read this story before.

### The Hunt 猎杀【瑞弗】

NCPD boy in blue gives you a holler and you come runnin' like an obedient dog? This ain't gonna become a habit is it? Well, whatever - sounds like he's got an errand for you, real personal kind. Least it's better than chasing dead politicians. Just do me a favor - don't get used to it.

Upon completion:
So some depraved maniac's kidnapping boys, and lo and behold, your badge is caught up in the middle of it. Gotta be honest, this doesn't look good. Peter Pan's just another manifestation of this fucked up city - probably already ended those poor brats. But on the off-chance Randy's still alive... If I were you, I'd go save him. Especially if "breaking the law" is involved.

## Pacifica

### Love Rollercoaster 我爱过山车

And they say Pacificans don't like strangers... These kids must be an exception to the rule. They found themselves a good vantage point and it'd only be better if that got that old roller coaster runnin'. At least, that's what I'd try.

## Santo Domingo

### A Day In The Life 平常的一天

Gonna sound like my gramps for a sec, but you know, in my time, being a punk meant something different. People fought against the system whatever way they could, frying the biggest fish they could catch, tearing down palaces brick by brick. Now every random gonk-brain fool thinks they're a hero for flatlining an unarmed normie. This isn't your beef, I get it... But are you sure don't wanna teach those worms a lesson?

### Ezekiel Saw the Wheel 见义勇为

Here's a joke for you: V walks into a bar... and gets robbed. The end.

Jesus, you and your shit luck. You better figure something out quick or our epic story's about to get cut short in the stupidest way imaginable. Accidental deaths don't jive too well with me. Or with the birth of legends.

### Gun Music 火上浇油

The Aldecaldos must really be desperate. To come this close to the city, and deal with scavs no less... Risky move. Sounds like they could use a hand.

### Rebel! Rebel! 反抗！反抗！【克里】

Look, I don't know if Kerry's just having a real late-life crisis, or whether his shrink's got him some on some sweet new meds, but I do know one thing: this gon' be good. Just meet with the guy. Won't be bored, I guarantee it. And Kerry needs some help. Always did. I got nothing against it, either. A friend in need is a friend indeed, and I've never been jealous of that second fiddle in my life.

### Sex On Wheels 爱车一族

Who ever said no to a free car? Not to mention it's a Quadra Turbo Fuckin' R. So quit picking your nose, head down to Rancho Coronado and get behind that wheel.

### Sinnerman 罪与罚【约书亚】

You're right about one thing - this job from Wakako stinks to high heaven. Besides, you're above doing plain ol' hit jobs. Probably no harm in talking to Bill Jablonsky and seeing what his deal is. But if I were you? I'd take a hard pass.

### Space Oddity 天外奇物

Every bum in this town dreams someday they'll hit the jackpot on something they dug up in a dumpster and it'll transform their life. A briefcase stuffed with eddies, a shard holding big company secrets, a cuttin' edge implant that'll pawn for a few dozen Gs. Problem is, usually whoever "misplaced" the thing to begin with is still lookin' for it - and they ain't in a good mood. Do these poor street rats a favor and take this case off their hands. Before the previous owner shows up and decides to make target practice out of 'em.

### Stadium Love 信仰是一颗子弹

Hey, if you wanna crash that party, I can respect that. Sometimes those parties kick the most ass. Just watch yourself - this ain't your uncle's birthday barbecue. One wrong word, one false step... there could be blood.

### The Highwayman 情比金坚

There's a still of some young guy in the garage - the heartbreaker type. Emails on the computer are from a certain James - don't have to be a genius to connect the dots. Might be worth looking for our Romeo - especially in Japantown. Got a feeling the still was snapped there. Wouldn't surprise me - kids go on dates there all the time. Shit... it always starts off so cute, doesn't it? Rarely ever ends that way.

Josie hid the Tyger boss's bike somewhere in the city, near the All Foods factory in Maelstrom turf. Said to look for a "ghost horse." All right then... Think of it like a scavenger hunt, though not the kind fixers in Night City usually pay you for.

Josie... Pretty name. Cute girl. Ugly end. This Tyger from the still... better have a word with him, V. Can't let slide what he did to this poor girl.

Another mystery, another missing person in Night City. Used to be the cops would put out a search for people like her. Today, her fate's in your hands.

### There Is A Light That Never Goes Out 皆是恩旨【约书亚】

I love these WTF situations. A guy hires you to off some other guy, and then that first guy dies, but then the second guy hires you to go somewhere with him for who the fuck knows what. But hey, it's not like you're short on work. Just don't fuck this one up, OK? I know you wanna know how this all plays out.

## Watson

### A Cool Metal Fire 金属狂人

Now, I don't ask you for much, but I gotta zero Smasher myself. That motherfucker thinks he's invincible. Worse, so does Rogue. All these years, Arasaka Tower's been haunting her. Enough's enough. I'm taking control this one time, I'm finding him, I'm wiping Adam Smasher off the face of the earth.

### Big in Japan 东瀛第一等

Find the package, and deliver it from A to B. Simple job, huh? But then why not just book some delivery guy? And why not go through a fixer? Something smells off about this one, V.

### Blistering Love 梦缠绕的时候【罗格】

Can't even remember why Rogue and I were always at each other's throats. All I remember is the good times - and how few of them there were. Now I've got one night to make it up to her. Yeah, a movie date sounds boring, but hell, we never did normal, boring things. Better late than never, right?

### Both Sides, Now 幻灭

You ever hear the saying "No good deed goes unpunished"? You hold your hand out to someone, you get bitten. You help a poor soul in need, you get fleeced for all you're worth. Save someone's life? Fill in the blank.

### Burning Desire/Night Moves 活在裆下/夜间行动

That's the great thing about Night City - no chance you'll ever get bored here. Where else could you have some dude with a smoking crotch jump into your car askin' to hitch a ride? Come on, V, show some sympathy. Get this guy to a ripper before his dick explodes all over your dashboard.

### Chippin' In 插管【强尼】

This is it, Rogue's in for the kill - she's ready to stop running from her past and catch Smasher. And when we catch the bastard, I wanna be the one to pull the trigger. But for now - you're in charge. Happy hunting!

### Every Breath You Take 你的每一寸呼吸【蓝月】

Blue Moon has a problem. One that a publicist, an agent, or even an entourage can't solve. That's 'cause this is a problem with some actual meat on it, one that calls for somebody with a half-decent brain on their shoulders and some hot iron in their holster. Someone really loves her - or loves to hate her. You gotta find this guy and take him out. For most, an opportunity to help a big-time pop icon like her only happens once in a... well, you get it.

### Fool on the Hill 山丘上的愚者【米丝蒂】

Maybe these strange images that you're seein' really do exist. Or maybe the biochip's already turned your brain into scop and salmon casserole. Whatever the case, spotting these symbols in unexpected places feels like a mystery beggin' to be solved. In your shoes, I'd have a word with Viktor of that chakra chick about these. Should interest at least one of 'em.

### Fortunate Son 换肾

Kidney failure. In the city, nothing that a stack of eddies and a few minutes won't solve. But in the Badlands... a death sentence. That is, unless a gentle soul somewhere feels like playin' guardian angel. Someone that'll get him the implant he needs before it's too late. Well, V? Think there 's anyone out there like that?

### Full Disclosure 大曝光

Sandra Dorsett... that chick you pulled out of a scavs' nest? Man, give someone an inch and they take a mile... This databank must be pretty special to her if she ain't even willing to go through a fixer. Well, damn... now I'm kinda curious. Gonna help out - or play by the rules of the game?

### Happy Together 当你凝视深渊时【巴里】

Seems like the PD's taken an interest in a neighbor of yours. Even sounded like they knew each other. Will you assume the mantle of a concerned, responsible citizen and ask what's going on? I mean, if you got a potential psycho for a neighbor, wouldn't you want to know?

### Human Nature 机械与人格

When a person dies, the world keeps chugging along without skipping a beat. Eventually, all traces of that person fade into nothing. Long story short, that's why your wheels were towed. Want my opinion? The best way to convince the world you're alive and kicking is to get your wheels back. Hell, maybe it's not the most ambitious goal, but for a minor-league merc like you, at least it's a start.

### Machine Gun 四季宝/随身小宝

So, what, You're giving Skippy to Regina? Too bad. Not everyday find a gun you can share your deepest and darkest with. And have it reciprocate, that is. On the other hand, I get you... Already got enough voices in your head, amirite?

### Paid in Full

I don't know many rippers who'd install Kiroshi optics on credit and faith. In fact, I only know one - Viktor. Maybe once you're on top you don't forget about the old guy, yeah? Pay the man what he's due.

### Psycho Killer 变态杀手

Looks like Regina wants to turn you into a one-woman/man army in the fight against cyberpsychosis. Understandable, seeing as most of our heroic badges seem to vanish from the scene at the mention of "cyberpsycho."

One thing I still don't get - why does she want them alive?

### Sacrum Profanum/Losing my Religion 全金属和尚/破戒

Among the handful of things that really piss me off, I'd say pickin' on the little guy for funsies is pretty high on my list. If I could save this monk and scrap a few tinboy Maelstromers along the way, I'd say sign me up. If you feel the same - and hurry your ass up - maybe you can even still save the guy.

### Shoot To Thrill 弹无虚发

A shooting range competition? Ho-ho, wonder what fun prizes are up for grabs. Giant teddy bear? Inflatable sword? Tiny plastic football? Whatever it is, enjoy yourself, 'cause I'm sittin' this one out. Don't much like it when people treat weapons like toys.

### Spellbound 魔法秘典【巴特莫斯】

A job from Nix? Should be interesting. Guy's got a rep for being an expert on antique tech, pre-Krash hardware. Decks, mag disks, yada yada yada. Some people'll tell you it's all as useful as a typewriter, a record player, a pile of dried cat shit. But me... I wouldn't be so sure about that.

### Talkin' 'bout a Revolution 让我们在云顶撒点野【朱迪】

There's no such thing as a free lunch, V. If someone invites you to a chow-down, someone's gonna pay. Who knows, maybe the bad guys'll saddle up - answer for all the bad shit they've done. But you know what I think? I think you're the one who's paying. And that check's well on its way.

### The Prophet's Song 先知之歌【先知盖瑞】

A clandestine meeting of reptilians at midnight? V, we're not missing this. If you want answers to questions plaguing humankind for eons, this might be your only shot. Is there life in the cosmos? Is there anyone pulling the strings? If so, why? And why the fuck do they let all this evil shit happen? And to think the Universe's greatest secrets could be found in some old factory in our humble little Night City...

### Tune Up 理赔

Fender benders are a dime a dozen in Night City. A Delamain though? A first, I'm guessing. But now he wants to hand out compensation for damages? That's just downright suspect. Way I see it, he's got a the AI equivalent of a gun pointed at his head, and this message is nothing but a coded cry for help. Nobody, and I mean nobody, doles out compensation for a little chipped paintwork. Go and see what this is about - worst case you come out a little richer.

### Venus in Furs 穿皮草的维纳斯【斯科特】

Meredith Stout invited you over to her room at the No-Tell Motel? Shit, V, don't know whether to give you props or talk you out of it... Either way, you're telling me your secret for picking up corpo chicks.

### Violence 一万次的悲伤【利琪·薇兹】

Unknown number, anonymous client, a secret hotel meet-up... The aura of mystery 'round this one's so thick I need a machete to hack my way through it. Wonder what'll happen next... and what that means for you.

## Westbrook

### Coin Operated Boy/Spray Paint 有求必应/禁止涂鸦【布兰登】

All right, so I'm feeling like a sucker for this story. Do you really think Brendan is just spitting out the sentences is was programmed for? The stuff some marketing guru thinks customers want to hear? That'd be pretty fucked even by Night City standards. In any case, we won't know until you find him.

### Dream On 美梦继续【杰佛逊】

Well, well, special favors for politicians. You think you've got any clout here? The Peralezes might seem like decent and down-to-earth folk - not sitting snug in the corps' pockets like the rest. But they're still part of the ruling elite, V. If they gotta step over you to get to the top, they won't hesitate. Don't believe even for a second that they're any different.

### Holdin' On 没有理想不伤心【克里】

The whole time I was flat on my digital ass in Mikoshi, Kerry was out there forging his glittering solo career. He'd better be real fucking chill after all these years, right? But something tells me deep down, he's still the same. Anyway, come on, guy's gonna shit himself when he sees me.

### Off the Leash 挣脱束缚【克里】

You know, Kerry's whole escapade makes me think. People do change. He did, I mean - he made it to a crossroads, and now I can see his rockerboy heart pushing him down the right path. The problem, you ask? Kerry might've changed, but the city hasn't. And I think he knows it. Hell, so do you.

### Pisces 千人千面【朱迪】

What's worse than a corpo? A wannabe corpo.

You know what? I'm not even surprised you let yourself get talked into this little uprising. Hey, back in my day I would've bum rushed the riot shields in the name of joytoys' freedom or whatever... But this Maiko chick? I've got a bad feeling about her.

### Poem Of The Atoms 原子之诗【禅学大师】

You really enjoy this meditation thing? Calms your nerves, does it? 'Cause it somehow reminds me of those black-tie musicians they stick next to the towels and mouthwash in monochromer joints so you can get taste of culture after you let out a shit. But hey, to each their own.

### Send in the Clowns 易燃易爆炸

Ozob... Quite the name. Don't know why, but the sound of it gets creepy circus music stuck in my head. Maybe the dude was an acrobat or lion tamer or some shit. Never know in this city. And we won't know till we call him and find out.

### Stairway To Heaven 通往天国的阶梯【禅学大师】

Look at that, your Zen master has reappeared. Some advertising shtick, no doubt. Thing is, I don't know fuck all about what he's trying to sell you. Stay sharp around characters like him.

### Sweet Dreams 白日春梦

Everyone knows the most gut-twisting, brain-blitzing, 'dorph-jacking braindances aren't bought in stores or feeders, but on the streets, outside normal circulation. Take our fine man Stefan, here, as proof. Seems he's got the rawest BDs in the city - not for the faint of heart. Whaddaya say? Wanna take that rush to the next level?

### **The Ballad of Buck Ravers** 巴克·拉弗斯情歌

Don't think I've gone all sentimental or anything. Honestly, I couldn't give a shit if I've got any fans left in this city. If someone hears one of my tracks and they get the itch to take to the streets, then that's fucking nova, but those old recordings don't matter anymore. Find 'em, listen to 'em, I don't care. Although while we're on the subject... Wonder how thing are over at Rainbow Cadenza...

### The Gig 买卖

Whenever we go see Wakako and walk into that pachinko salon of hers, I get this weird, like, tingling feeling on the back of my neck. I dunno, V, she's all knots of weird. Anyway, she promised a special reward for this job with Sandra Dorsett. All we have to do is go see her on Jig-Jig Street.

### They Won't Go When I Go 上帝保佑【约书亚】

Well, whaddaya know. This corpo-slut from the crucifixion BD wants you to come back to give her star a pep talk, massage his fucking shoulders and whatnot. Normally I'd tell you to drop it, find something more fun to do, but... I dunno, seems like this Jesus freak could really use your help.

你猜怎么着？那个拍十字架超梦的公司婊想让你过去给她的小明星打打气，替他捏捏肩膀，嘬嘬老二。正常情况下，我会跟你说这活儿别接了，找点其它有意思的干干，不过呢……我也吃不准，看样子这个耶稣怪胎真的需要你帮忙。

## 目击赛博精神病

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Bloody Ritual 血腥仪式

Not everyone's made for Maelstrom. Some - surprise, surprise - don't take to well to having half their face chopped off. They start hearing voices, seeing and imagining things. Then, it's enough to get their hands on a gun, and... that recipe for disaster's ready to serve.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Demons of War 事出反常必有妖

Usually, when a corpo gets his walking papers, he loses all his implants too. They dig those synth organs and cyber eyes right out of his body. But sometimes, the chrome's so far ingrown, it can't be removed safely. Even if someone really, really wants it...

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Discount Doc 打折的医生

Working on a construction site has its perks: breeze on your face, sun on your shoulders, no creepy corpo smell and tangible results you can show off to the world. It's good, honest work. 'Course Night City's always got a way of fucking things up.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: House on a Hill 山林小屋

Shots were heard on the outskirts of NC - rare given the seemingly peaceful area. We oughta go and take a closer look. Why wait for the clean-up crew when there could still be lives that need saving?

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Letter of the Law 有法必依

I have a bad feeling about this. A real bad feeling.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Lex Talionis 同态复仇

The underpass near GIM is like NC's Bermuda Triangle for the homeless. Sound like a piece of cake? In the heart of Pacifica, nothing ever is.

Enter at your own risk.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Lt. Mower 莫厄尔中尉

WARNING! CYBERPSYCHO DETECTED. MILITECH HAS LOCKED DOWN THE AREA. KEEP AWAY!

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: On Deaf Ears 充耳不闻

Hey V! Watch out. Whoever left those bodies is still hanging around.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Phantom of Night City 夜之城魅影

Ghosts? Ghosts don't exist, V. The dead can tell you that.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Seaside Cafe 海滨咖啡馆

Whoever killed them was packing a lot of hate, a lot of rage. And those feelings don't fade quickly. Be careful.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Second Chances 人生重来

Everyone deserves a second chance, V. I know that better than most. But who's granting that chance and who's getting it are important questions that oughta be asked.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Six Feet Under 入土为安

Maelstrom certainly has its own unique recruitment and retention methods. Ranks getting too thin? Well, just kidnap a few Valentinos, knock 'em out cold and bolt on some new faceplates. What could possibly go wrong with that? everything, that's what.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Smoke on the Water 水上的烟雾

If it weren't for the all the screaming, dead Scavs and that wreck of a car, be a pretty nice place. But hey, that's life. Wanna go check it out, see what went down? Try the pier first.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: The Wasteland 荒原

Does a cyclone of dust and sand stirred up by a dash cyberpsychosis sound exciting? Then I do I have some good news for you.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Ticket to the Major Leagues 跟大哥们混的资格

Not all people cope the same way when those first symptoms of cyberpsychosis show up. Some throw themselves off a bridge. Others hand themselves over to the cops. And most of the rest try to self-treat with sedatives - as many as they can get their hands on. No matter the cost.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Under the Bridge 大桥下

V, you don't have anywhere else to be? Only thing you'll stir up here is trouble. I'd beat it, but... you do you.

### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Where the Bodies Hit the Floor 兔死狗烹

There are few certainties in Night City... Super-sketch stomach-melting streetfood, politicians choked by corporate leashes and the echo of screams heard coming from the Totentanz club. Oh wait, and one more thing: if you step foot down the wrong alley, your head will probably roll out the other end.

## 其他

### Gig: Goodbye, Night City 再见，夜之城

Sometimes you need a friend to lean on. Sometimes you need a friend to break you out of an immigrant detention center at the Night City-SoCal border.

Smuggler Bruce Welby required the latter.

Bruce tried to cross the state line with hot cargo in tow, but it didn't work out as planned and now he's been chained up by Militech border security already several days. His buddy (and Militech employee), Archibald Crane, found out about the situation through the grapevine. I'll be damned if that cuckoo corpo actually decided to help his friend instead of towing the corpo line. He contacted me to get Bruce out of his cage.

You're the missing element in this friendship triangle. Find to Bruce, break him out, and escort him to his combatta, Archie. And let's make sure Militech doesn't notice a thing, OK? Get to it.

One more thing - Archie says not to kill any corpos. So, what can I say? The client's always right.

# （5）NCPD

## Reported Crime: Blood in the Air

Looks like this choomba wanted to climb the turbine to fix something. Militech didn't want him to. 1 determined person + 1 unhappy corp = 1 dead dude. Easy math.

## Reported Crime: Comrade Red

Soviets in the American desert. If that doesn't sound like a good spy story to you, go swap those ears! and check out the stash they were writing about.

## Reported Crime: Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close

See, V? Not everyone finds a new best friend in the dump. That samurai's not waking up anytime soon.

## Reported Crime: I Don't Like Sand

You know, there are some days when anything that can go wrong, will. Some days you burn your toast and forget your keys, other days... Militech comes and fucks you up for losing a car in a sandstorm.

## Reported Crime: Turn Off the Tap

Seems Sandra was a bit of a partier, but lost her cash flow when she lost her job. See, V? Better not run the EDGE of financial solvency. So - how bout we check out the car she left in the corpo lot?

## Reported Crime: Smoking Kills 吸烟有害健康

Smoking used to get a bad rap, but smokers can breathe easy this day and age. Lung cancer? Buy a new lung. Throat cancer? Again, buy a new throat. Male performance problems? Mr. Stud will turn that dangle upside down. Turns out, however, the addiction itself can still lead to death. If someone nasty's keeping track of where and when you step out for a cig, well... Maybe it was better to kick the habit after all.

以前吸烟可不是个好习惯，但现如今，老烟枪们可算是翻身把歌唱。肺癌? 那就买个新的肺。吃癌? 一样，买个新喉哆。男性功能障碍? 大钢炮帮你重振雄风。不过呢，到头来烟瘾本身还是会把人害死。要是有人不怀好意，把你习惯出门抽烟的时间地点都记了下来……那我看，还是戒了的好。

## Reported Crime: Honey, Where are You?

Looks like Night City punishes love, betrayal, or indifference. Maybe all three. What we can say is there's a dead guy with a car somewhere in town. A car full of eddies.

## Reported Crime: Roadside Picnic

Her name was Nina. And she died alone, terrified. You'll fill in the rest of the story, V.

## Reported Crime: A Stroke of Luck

The dead don't talk, but their money sure does. Check out the house on Mallagra. Mr. skunky scuba over here sure won't be needing those eddies anymore.

## Reported Crime: Disloyal Employee

HR in Night City is brutal. I mean, just look at how he left that exit interview! And the guy only stole tidbits of intel. Eh, well... No use crying over spilled milk. Wanna check out his stash? Let's see how much he managed to scrape together from his little side job.

## Reported Crime: Justice Behind Bars

Looks like the prison guard was in 6th Street's pocket. Surprised? Me neither. But clearly something way bigger was being planned here. Wonder what went wrong.

## Reported Crime: Supply Management

Another poor choom just trying to get by. All he wanted was to undercut the corps a little, make a few eds off a few boosters. Well, didn't do much for his health. Know what would give us a boost, though? A little peek at what he left behind.

## Reported Crime: Welcome to Night City

Our Wraith dealer here chose the wrong market. He made, as they say, a deadly misstep. But now you can get something out of it, right V? Just check his stash.

## Reported Crime: Dangerous Currents

Excise duty, audits, taxes, bribes, queues... If you want to transport something legally, you have to jump through a lot of hoops. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that many take shortcuts. Though as we all know, shortcuts can be dangerous...

## Reported Crime: Don't Forget the Parking Brake!

Parking on a hill? Don't forget the parking brake. Otherwise, your car might start rolling downhill... Along with that valuable cargo in the trunk.

## Reported Crime: Dredged Up

Dark, damp and the stench is enough to make you add to the muck... But there's always something interesting down there. Know what this place is? You'll find out soon enough. But before you do, better check what's in that container, see what really went down here first.

## Reported Crime: Needle in a Haystack

Thing about containers is, they're all the same. Usually not a problem, but... Well, now you got no idea which one's got the thing you want. And that's when the plot thickens.

## Reported Crime: One Thing Led to Another

Ah, the irony. Those gangoons installed a gadget to track the cops... And now the cops can track them right back. Technology servers no man, it seems. Zero loyalty!

## Reported Crime: Paranoia

The homeless in Night City are frequent decenders into madness - in part because they live in perpetual fear, povery and hunger, but also due to seeing things that shouldn't be seen. The shard you just found... It could be the ravings of just another lunatic. Or perhaps something more...

## Reported Crime: Protect and Serve

Well, well, well. This comp proves the gangoons are buying off cops right and left! We gotta do something! Like, say, grab that Tyger Claw scratch just sitting there, waiting for the police. No eddies, no corruption, right? Look at us, cleaning up these mean Night City streets.

## Reported Crime: Worldly Possessions

Say what you will, but you ever see a stiff, it's never a bad idea to do a little rummaging. People rarely die for no reason. There's usually a bone to pick that eventually gets picked. Take, for example, some gonk who's neck deep in debt. Maybe instead of payin' it off they decide to keep it safe someplace...

## Reported Crime: Another Circle of Hell

Choom wanted to grab someone's data, got himself burned. Clear? BURNED. But seriously - it could be worth checking the coords from his gear. Chooms like him usually have some nice toys.

## Reported Crime: Lost and Found

Dealer torn up by hungry junkies. It happens. So, what'll it be, V? Wanna see what they got in that stash of theirs? Might just get something outta this.

## Reported Crime: Table Scraps

Gotta have a permit to even pick through these rich assholes' sloppy seconds. Jalapeño Joe didn't, that's why he had to go. And who did him? Some fucking corpo buttlickers. Tellin' ya, the sooner we burn this city, the better.

## Reported Crime: You Play with Fire...

Smell that, V? Another scorched runner. Wonder what he said right before he sizzled.
