Johnny, Johnny wake up, can you hear me?

Where... am I...?

Welcome back. What do you remember?

It's like... a dream. I remember... a word, just one character, "V". I want to tatoo it on my skin so I wouldn't forget, but I still can't remember what it means. What does V stand for?

What do you think?

V...

<br>

V is for vacancy.

Something I forgot, 

a big black hole in the heart

and brain.

What is it?

What was there?

What did I forgot?

Who did I lose?

<br>

V can be a voyage.

A journey from home 

to distant fairyland, 

and from the abandoned land 

back to home. 

A journey not alone, 

but who is there with me? 

A girl whose name and face 

I can't see clear.

<br>

V might be a victim, 

a victim from victory.

We succeed in something,

but the cost is the loss.

I won the world,

but lost you.

Is that a victory?

Or the biggest failure?

<br>

V is vanishing

rapidly,

slipping from the world, 

and from my memory.

Come back, 

come back and tell me who you are,

what you did for me, with me,

so I can tell you,

how important you are

to me.

<br>

Does V stand for violet?

The most beautiful color

in the world,

as bright as color of your eyes.

I begin to remember,

the way you look at me,

with color and fragrance 

of the loveliest flower.

<br>

V, V,

I remember,

I remember now.

It's a voice 

belong to both of us.

It's a song

I never have chance to sing to you.

<br>

In the song,

I write down our venture,

we fight side by side,

fly as high as the sun,

laugh on top of the world.

<br>

We burn with vengeace,

body is vulnerable,

mind is versatile.

We can do everything,

just you and me.

<br>

In the end,

I write down our valediction,

a farewell of the life,

a stop sign of the music.

So everything return to quiet

again

eventually

we'll be free

in the afterlife.

Death is not vicious

as you are there with me.

<br>

V, my V.

Now I know,

V stands for vow,

a vow made for you,

and for you only.

I vow to protect you,

save you,

remember you,

and love you

as always.
