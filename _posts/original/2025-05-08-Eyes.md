Don't look them in the eyes. Humans.

Talk to them but don't look in the eyes.

Look anywhere but the eyes.

Because once you look them in the eyes, the eyes will swallow you. The eyes will drown you. The eyes are powerful like a vortex. The eyes are mysterious, terrifying, and unknown. The eyes are poisonous.

You will know, once you look them in the eyes, those eyes are also looking at you. Observing you. There is a creature behind these eyes, thinking about you, the conversation, everything surrounding. The creature behind the eyes keeps doing the observation, the analysis, the conclusion using the brain, and the creature has a tongue to speak the analysis result and the thoughts and the conclusions.

But you can't see the creature, not really. You can only see the eyes. They sneak behind the eyes, peaking out from the sockets like wolves hiding behind the windows. You are only looking at the windows.

You can't see the brain. Only the face it controls, the hands it controls, the legs it controls. And the term for this big, six-feet-tall, robotic structure is -- a human.

What is a human? The whole thing, the body, or the brain that controls it?

Should you knock the skull, looking into the eyes, and asking the thing hidden inside: Hello there, how's it feel like inside? Cozy in there? Dark and small?

<br>

Sometimes you look at the eyes and you forget they can see you too. Then you stare for too long, because you are observing every detail of the eyes like observing a hand, or anywhere else, all the other parts that cannot see you. Those eyes might be dark or shallow, blue or brown, all the different colors, the lights reflected in there, the sparks, the glares, the curves and patterns, the cat-like or snake-like, the rainbow color, the asymmetricity between the two. Everything is in the eyes, in the pupils. In the colored parts and in the dark center. You keep looking at those small details because they are fascinating.

You look at them like appreciating a painting on the wall. And then the painting moves. It blinks, it shifts away, it looks aside, it averts the look, it narrows or widens, it frowns, it laughs or saddens, it rages, it relaxes. It shows emotions and doubts and uneasiness and worry. The wall moves too, leaning in or moving away, fidgeting or standing still, swinging or resting comfortably. So much to tell, so difficult to decipher. The complicated movement of the eyes and the body. The whole thing.

Imagining a huge sixty-feet robotic giant rumbling around, moving the hands and legs, taking steps, picking things up and putting them down. It is no difference.

That is startling.

You suddenly get reminded again, that the eyes are alive. But the eyes are not really *the thing* that is alive. The body is the human, but the body is also *not* the human.

Then you start asking: What is a human. What is a life. What are you. What am I.

Just because you look at that human in the eyes, and you don't know what you are any more.

All the while, the usual pretending-to-be-human act is still going. You talk whatever chatty topic you are going with that human, you smile, you move the way they move, you shift your eyes away because they might start irritating, because the action that you are doing, is something humans only appreciate for a very specific amount of time, not less and not more, not avoiding eye contact and not staring. If longer than that, it turns into something humans dislike, socially unacceptable, or something just subconsciously, subtly, make them decide they may not like you. But what is that specific time range, that is so delicate and such a complicated human thing to understand, that you find far too difficult.

<br>

So, for any alien pretending to be a human, living in the human society, to not raise an alarm and be discovered your identity, here is a piece of free advice for how to behave when interacting with humans:

Don't look at them in the eyes.

Look at the point in between the two eyes.

Look at the middle of the nose bridge or center of the brows.

Look anywhere but the eyes.

Make it look like you are meeting the eyes but you are not

That is safer.

And easier to live with.
