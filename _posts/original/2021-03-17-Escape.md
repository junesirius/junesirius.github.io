where can I escape to

how can I run away

if it's my own shadow

that terrifies me

if it's my own mind

that bounds me

if it's my own hands

that drag me down

<br>

how can I be free

where can I run

why can't I let myself go

I'm in my own cage

I don't want to set myself free

so I can only

crawl in the bottom of cage

shiver

tearful

bite my own flesh

feel the pain

and know

that I'm still alive
