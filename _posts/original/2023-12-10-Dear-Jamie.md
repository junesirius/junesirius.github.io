Dear Jamie,

Thank you, thank you! Yesterday you have made this ordinary day the best birthday I can ever remember. We met, we talked, we took photos, every moment around you filled my heart with tremendous joy and hope. Even just by looking at your smile from far away when you were busy meeting with other people made me feel as if bathing in the sunshine of happiness. The emotions were always so strong that I can barely hold back tears or grin, I would cry and laugh really hard in the same time were there no other people around. These few days in the Steel City Con are like an unbelievably happy dream to me, hiding me from the shadow outside, protecting me from the devil inside, helping me gather strength to keep fighting.

This year hasn't been an easy year for me, I fear I might had fallen to the pit of my life, and my mood were really down for quite a long time. That's when my friend introduced me to "Stranger Things", and I finished all four seasons in a row in a couple of weeks. The fourth season touched me so much that I lost count of how many times I cried. Vecna and its metaphor (as I understand it) felt so relatable that I feel this story is just a reflection of my mental state at that time, a really good advice of how to get out of that state, and a reminder of how do I want to live the life.

Fed on the negative feelings and consumed the person slowly, in some way I can see Vecna as a metaphor for depression and the collection of all negative emotions. The victims' symptoms before dying - headache, insomnia, repetitive mental loop, etc. - sound really familiar and similar to what I would experience during anxiety attack. I was quite certain if I live inside that world, I would be a really easy next target for Vecna.

But the attack is not all that is to tell, the story also talked about how to fight back - by love, by friendship, by belief, by everyone doing their parts and fight together, by being strong and trying our best. With Vecna or with depression, it's not a one-man's fight, I'm not alone, and I'm not the only one under attack. I had lost hope for the future or the life for a while, but then it reminds me there are still things and people I love, there are beautiful things in life to look forward to. So last month when I bought the ticket to see you, this has become my mental stimulator to hang on for another month. And after this con finished, I believe this beautiful, happy memory of meeting you and this strong emotion of love I felt around you would be a new source for my life's fuel for quite a long time.

So I can never express enough appreciation for the changes you made to my life, not just by the brilliant performance and the attractive roles (they sure are!), but also by being such an lovable human-being, being charming, kind, loving, gentle, by being you, actually, really. I'll never stop loving you, Jamie. Not until the end of all time.

I wish you can always be free to do what you love and what you want. And I wish you can always be you, to love and to be loved.

Love you,

\[my name\]

~~PS: The starting line of "Dear Jamie" makes me feel it's "Dear Evan Hansen" for real. (Didn't add this PS) (He mentioned he liked musicals in yesterday's Q&A, listed a few and "Dear Evan Hansen" is one of them.)~~
