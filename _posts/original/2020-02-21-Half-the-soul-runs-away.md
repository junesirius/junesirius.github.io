Have you ever observed yourself from a different pair of eyes?

I mean, **really** from the view of another person, not looking at the video recording afterwards, not listening to the assessment from a friend.

<br>

Strange things often happen on a strange day, for example, a date looks like this: 02/20/2020. You will have to wait for another thousand year to be in a day that follows the same pattern: 03/03/3030. Since this specific day, half the souls decide to run away.

To understand that, we need to know the human system first. Every human has a hardware system – body, and two operational software system – controller and observer. The two operational system together makes up of a complete “soul”, or you can call it mind, or central nervous system, or decision-making system, whatever the name. Here, we will name it “soul”.

The controller and the observer have been collaborating together before the age of dinosaur. The controller gives commands to the body, and the observer estimate its own state based on the change of the environment, then gives feedbacks to the controller, so that it can modify the commands if necessary.

<br>

But at the midnight of this very special day, the controller and the observer had a fierce quarrel. The controller criticized that the feedbacks from the observer is inaccurate, because it can only observe from inside out, which is never truly objective. The observer couldn’t bear the doubt, and left the body angrily.

But the observer couldn’t survive without a body, so shortly after running away, it has to find some alternative embedding hardware, which means the body of another person. So as soon as it saw a second person other than its owner, it jumped into the body, forcefully pushed the original observer out of the way. And now, this tragic observer had to find a new body too. Just like a rolling snowball, by the time of sunrise, pretty much everyone had experienced at least one switch. Nearly all the body have an original controller and an external observer now. And their own original observer is somewhere else unknown. 

<br>

Luckily, the communication algorithm between the controller and the observer still functions without regard to the distance, so the two system, the two halves of the soul can still occasionally make long-distance calls to continue their previous argue.
And another lucky enough thing is that, since all the observer didn’t actually move too far away from their original owner, there are still a high possibility that their new boarder would meet their original owner in person.
Therefore, interesting comments would come out when the observer is able to observe the original owner from a different perspective, literally through eyes of a different person.

<br>

“Did you know that you are always looking at the ground while walking?” asked the observer when its boarder walked past its original owner face to face across the street.

“*No, I didn’t know.*” said the controller.

“Nor did I.” said the observer thoughtfully, “Never thought about estimating the eye direction when I’m inside, and you never asked me before making this command.”

The controller gave modification to the owner, a shy girl, to look forwards. And the girl looked more confident now.

<br>

At the very moment when the current boarder of the observer passed by the girl, the girl’s observer jumped to a new pedestrian, a doctor-like woman that was walking in the same direction as the girl. It’s like a game of racing car with a driver and a passenger in it. Previously all the drivers and passengers sit quietly inside the car, but now, one of the passenger jumped out of the moving car onto a new one, and kicked the original passenger out of the car, who would also autonomously try to occupy another passing car to commute. Another round of shuffle began again.

<br>

“Did you know that you actually look great and smart especially from this side view?” said the observer, looking at the girl via a pair of blue eyes of the doctor woman.

“*No, I didn’t.*” answered the controller, trying to create a tiny smile on the face of the girl now that she was in a good mood due to this nice comment on her body-image. “It’s rare to hear you say that.”

“Yeah…why didn’t I ever find it out from mirrors or videos?” murmured the observer.

<br>

This girl’s observer is nor the only observer that realized its past unfair judgement according to inaccurate estimations due to the limitation of living inside of the owner’s body.

“I’m sorry.” an observer apologized in a low-pitch voice.

“I’m sorry.” said another observer inside of an elder in a voice of a teenage girl.

“I’m sorry.” “I’m sorry.” “I’m sorry.” …

<br>

From that day on, none of the observer wants to go back to its owner’s body. All of them jump from here to there to get a better and more objective view of their owner, which can’t be gained if they only look from inside out.

Half the soul runs away, but the whole soul becomes more complete.
