It really is the same, when making career decisions versus deciding to step into a new relationship. Especially when you know it's the wrong move, you know this career would never work out for you, just like you know the person you choose would never stay with you for a life long time. You know you don't belong there, just like you know the two of you are not even from the same world, right from the very beginning.

But you don't care. You can't care less.

For once, you want to be brave.

For once, you want to ignore any consequence.

Because you really love it. 

The fire of love within you is burning, is swallowing you alive, stripping your soul from your body.

You can't ignore the fire. You just can't. Like a moth flying towards the light. Like Icarus flying towards the sun.

Like the old saying goes, "Do it when you know you shouldn't." [1]

For once, you would think "what more can I lose?"

You become so brave, that you even forget about your beloved death.

Or... is it why you could finally become so brave?

If it's the last thing in your life that you can do, you'll do it. You just have to.

If it's the last person in your life you would fall in love with, then you'll have to let them know. There's no other way.

That's why you answered. Murmurs of approval. Flood of yes.

You become brave, as if there is no tomorrow to worry about. As if there is no tomorrow for you at all.

......

In the end, when reasons come back to you, it is time when you finally decide to stick around for a bit longer. And it is time when you push your love away, and wave them goodbye.

See? Love is destruction. It always is.

And that's exactly what fascinated you.

You can never resist it, the beauty of both.
