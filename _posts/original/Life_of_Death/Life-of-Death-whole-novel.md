> Prompt: You are Death, but in a post-apocalyptic world. Only a few survivors remain, and you’re doing everything you can to help them because if the last human dies, you die as well. The survivors can’t see you, but they feel your presence and noticed your effort. They started to call you Life.

- Aria (someone, lead arguer) hurt more in quarrel -> Death save again, weaken again

- Death try go self-sacrifice -> saved by Elena

- some small intimate moments between Elena/Death (Death give her her scythe, tool allow her have temp power of death, use only she absolutely sure wants to see her again)

- kid die -> Death say thank you and I love you, exchange life to save them, die finally (used up power, essence is in kid now)

- human test out theory, no one die again even if mortal wound -> human grow bigger

### Postlude (Act 4, Chap 16-18)

- jump time: survived apocalypse but human population too much, not having Death makes unbalanced universe -> Elena become new Death (cost is to reap her kid first), the two become one, reaping and saving together, both half Death half human/Life (story of Hades&Persephone) (reveal Theda=Death so they're one now, union: "Death with Life" never happen before)

Elena: You are NOT gonna kill yourself, you hear that? I don't care what bad omen or whatever --

someone: (cough) Excuse me, not just bad omen, she is literally *Death*.

Elena: *I DON'T CARE!* She's not gonna die, neither does any of us!
