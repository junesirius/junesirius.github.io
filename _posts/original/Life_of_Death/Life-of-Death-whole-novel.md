> Prompt: You are Death, but in a post-apocalyptic world. Only a few survivors remain, and you’re doing everything you can to help them because if the last human dies, you die as well. The survivors can’t see you, but they feel your presence and noticed your effort. They started to call you Life.

## Events/side plots

### Obstacles & initial helps (Act 1, Chap 1-5)

- food/water/supply: run out of -> guide to find more
- defense/protection: attacked by creature(?) -> lead them away
- sickness: ease by subtle change
- heat/water: move cloud, cover/show sun, wind/rain
- structure: broken bridge -> hold structure; storm -> hold house/shelter
- psychologic: suicidal -> revelation dream?

### Major twists (Chap 6)

- Elena dying -> Death sacrifices a piece to save, weakens and start humanize but still with power (when dying can see Death too)

### Death as human (Act 2, Chap 6-10)

- profound bond with Elena, develop deeper relationship

- side plots: people teach Death normal small human life joy, music, small game, etc., campfire dance trade story, Death talk about memorable life in the past, historical figures, biblical events, etc.

- side plots: human aspects troubles Death, small things, hungry, thirsty, pain, sensation(, sexual?)

- side plots: meet a few more people, see good/bad humanity

### Complications (Act 3, Chap 11-15)

- realize own existence endanger humans -> cause hostility against her

- Elena defend her -> dispute inside group, danger of split (Elena, Daphne, Henry, Iva; Aria, Theseus, Finnick)

- Aria (lead arguer, who?) hurt seriously in post-quarrel -> Death save again, weaken again

- Death try go self-sacrifice (all in when saving?) -> saved/stopped by Elena

- some small intimate moments between Elena/Death (Death give her her scythe, tool allow her have temp power of death, use only she's absolutely sure wants to see her again)

- kid die -> Death say thank you and I love you, exchange life to save them, die finally (used up power, essence is in kid now)

- human test out theory, no one die again even if mortal wound -> human start postpering

### Postlude (Act 4, Chap 16-18)

- jump time: survived apocalypse but human population too much, not having Death makes imbalanced universe -> Elena become new Death (cost is to reap her kid first), the two become one, reaping and saving together, both half Death half human/Life (story of Hades&Persephone) (reveal Theda=Death so they're one now, union: "Death with Life" never happen before)

## Death setting

### Power

- teleport
- invisible
- strength
- psychic: ~~tell truth/lie, mind-reading~~, sense strong emotion (especially sadness, hopelessness), go into dream
- control climate/weather
- control death of virus/creature/anything alive
- accelerate aging in life/decay in object/fossilization in stone
- entropy-surge chaos: things drop often, fire outburst, mysterious air flow

root: fast-forward regional time flow speed (explains weather control: just fast-forward cloud moving etc.; kill=fast-forward until it dies)

principle: increase entropy (Life decrease entropy), that's why can't heal and when do heal, hurt itself (entropy reduced)

### Limit

"Goes against rule/job description"

- Can't heal/slow down self-heal (unless give away itself)
- Can't bring back life (unless sacrifice)
- small things: can't bring life so can't grow plants, can't fix things (broken things stay broken, bad mechanics)

## Notes

(small design in titles: acrostic for each act: death, life, human, end)

After Elena becomes new Death, she's one with Theda, the two reunion scene; reaping and saving together. Because new Death comes from life, so half life half death, no restriction in power of no healing, so can start healing too. Officially get called by other humans "Life", depicted as white scythe etc. insisted to add Theda's profile too
