## Events/side plots

### Obstacles & initial helps (Act 1, Chap 1-5)

- food/water/supply: run out of -> guide to find more
- defense/protection: attacked by creature(?) -> lead them away
- sickness: ease by subtle change
- heat/water: move cloud, cover/show sun, wind/rain
- structure: broken bridge -> hold structure; storm -> hold house/shelter
- psychologic: suicidal -> revelation dream?

### Major twists (Chap 6)

- Elena dying -> Death sacrifices a piece to save, weakens and start humanize but still with power (when dying can see Death too)

### Death as human (Act 2, Chap 6-10)

- profound bond with Elena, develop deeper relationship

- side plots: people teach Death normal small human life joy, music, small game, etc., campfire dance trade story, Death talk about memorable life in the past, historical figures, biblical events, etc.

- side plots: human aspects troubles Death, small things, hungry, thirsty, pain, sensation(, sexual?)

- side plots: meet a few more people, see good/bad humanity

### Complications (Act 3, Chap 11-15)

- realize own existence endanger humans -> cause hostility against her

- Elena defend her -> dispute inside group, danger of split (Elena, Daphne, Henry, Iva; Aria, Theseus, Finnick)

- Aria (lead arguer, who?) hurt seriously in post-quarrel -> Death save again, weaken again

- Death try go self-sacrifice (all in when saving?) -> saved/stopped by Elena

- some small intimate moments between Elena/Death (Death give her her scythe, tool allow her have temp power of death, use only she's absolutely sure wants to see her again)

- kid die -> Death say thank you and I love you, exchange life to save them, die finally (used up power, essence is in kid now)

- human test out theory, no one die again even if mortal wound -> human start prospering

### Postlude (Act 4, Chap 16-18)

- jump time: survived apocalypse but human population too much, not having Death makes imbalanced universe -> Elena become new Death (cost is to reap her kid first), the two become one, reaping and saving together, both half Death half human/Life (story of Hades&Persephone) (reveal Theda=Death so they're one now, union: "Death with Life" never happen before)

## Death setting

### Power

- teleport
- invisible
- strength
- psychic (?): ~~tell truth/lie, mind-reading~~, sense strong emotion (especially sadness, hopelessness), go into dream
- control climate/weather
- control death of virus/creature/anything alive
- accelerate aging in life/decay in object/fossilization in stone
- entropy-surge chaos: things drop often, fire outburst, mysterious air flow, water activity/flood, fierce/extreme weather, sudden cold/hot temperature change

root: fast-forward regional time flow speed (explains weather control: just fast-forward cloud moving etc.; kill=fast-forward until it dies)

principle: increase entropy (Life decrease entropy), that's why can't heal and when do heal, hurt itself (entropy reduced)

### Limit

"Goes against rule/job description"

- Can't heal/slow down self-heal (unless give away itself)
- Can't bring back life (unless sacrifice)
- small things: can't bring life so can't grow plants, can't fix things (broken things stay broken, bad mechanics)

## Notes

(small design in titles: acrostic for each act: death, life, human, end)

# Main

**Summary**: "Revenge triumphs over death; love slights it; honor aspireth to it; grief flieth to it; fear pre-occupateth it" -- Francis Bacon "*Of Death*"

复仇战胜死亡，爱情蔑视死亡，荣誉渴望死亡，悲哀奔赴死亡，忧惧抢占死亡

## Act 1 - Fear pre-occupateth it

### Chap 1. Daphne

> **outline:** kid's innocent view of the post-apocalypse world, barren, sick, sense/see/hear Death, him relationship with Elena/cat/Henry; Death comfort she's gonna be ok, kid tells Elena, doesn't believe; Death care about kid

The wall in front of her was mottled, plaster peeling off, dark grey and white here and there. Pencil marks had been added to the surface, faint marks tracing natural patterns of circles and streaks, adding eyes to the white and limbs to the grey, becoming tiny human figures and creatures.

Daphne traced her fingers along the edges of the gaps where the plaster had fallen away, lost in thought and imagination. She slept on her left side, and this wall was the first and only thing she could see. She liked looking at it.

A bout of coughing hit her hard and suddenly. The small hand of hers retracted back under the thin blanket she huddled into, clutching at her own chest. The air became too sharp for the lungs, she coughed long and shakily, her frail body quivering with each wave.

The night was long.

She waited for the coughing to pass, and turned to lie on her back when it finally did. The ceiling looked much like the wall, though it was slightly farther away, out of reach, so she couldn't draw on it. The mottled paint was probably once snow white, now all looked dark yellow, and grey, and black.

Mostly black. Because there was barely any light, the shadows draped over most of the ceiling, like the way they covered most of the room. But Daphne had looked at the ceiling so many times that she didn't really need much light to make out all the familiar cracks and rifts.

The heat in the head was making her eyes hard to focus, and somewhere inside the body there was also something gnawing uncomfortably. She turned over again to the other side, the other wall was right alongside the bed mattress.

The air flowed slowly and dusty, she coughed again, pressing the mouth on the inside of the blanket, sound muffled, echoed by the trembling sound inside her chest.

The shadows in the room shifted, as if materializing into something real, furry and fluffy at the edges, warm and soft inside. It slipped from the loose end of her blanket, nestled into her arms.

"Lucky!" Daphne mumbled, surprised and delighted, once her breath was eased. She tightened her arms around the small, warm creature.

The black cat wriggled its way out from beneath the blanket, poking its nose out, rubbing against her chin, its body pressed close to hers.

The small arms wrapping around the cat loosened a little as the owner gradually closed her eyes at the slow humming purring sound. The cat closed the eyes too, keeping the paws gently around the little human.

<br>

The next time when Daphne woke again, the room was still cloaked in shadow and chill, but she was getting used to it. It was like this every day, all the time now. Not like any more light could come in, not like there was any more light anywhere anyway. But it didn't bother her much.

Lucky had jumped out of her embrace after she'd started to stir, but the cat hadn't left the room. She couldn't see it, but she could hear the soft breathing, sense the warmth of its body radiating through the space like a tiny furnace. She liked it staying here.

The dizziness from the fever had eased slightly from the head and body. Daphne stretched her small arms and legs a little, happily finding out she could do most of the movements without having to frown or groan.

She picked up a short pencil lying by the pillow that was made from a bundled jumper, added some more facial expressions to a plain face doodle on the wall that only had a white circle for face and two thin lines as eyes.

She was excited at her small painting project, but got tired fast. She had to let the pencil slip from her fingers again shortly, arms falling back onto the mattress. The face on the wall was still unfinished. The ceiling drifted back into view.

The darkness on the ceiling fluctuated slightly again, the cat didn't do anything. Daphne stared at it hard, trying to make out what it was but couldn't quite tell the shadows apart from the rest of the darkness.

And then there was something.

Daphne opened her eyes wide at the shape by her bed. It was a human figure, she thought, but humans wouldn't be so... she couldn't find a word, she was only almost ten, after all. The shadow wavered and wandered.

"Who are you?" she asked in a small voice.

The shadow answered with silence, but looked like it was coming closer. Daphne could make out a long hooded trench coat now. Aunty Elena had one looked just like that, but not as long, and it wasn't so utterly dark and black as midnight.

The girl swallowed, trying to make the throat work but the sore and dry feeling at the bottom of the throat was preventing it.

The shadow didn't look like the human anymore as it loomed closer. The hood covered the place where a face should be, but it looked like it didn't have a face at all.

Daphne curled beneath the blanket into a tighter ball than she already was, fingers clutching tight around the fabric.

She wanted to call for Aunty Elena -- she must be just outside, somewhere. But something about this shadow, this person, this... *thing*, made the sound froze in her throat.

She shivered, out of fear or cold she couldn't tell.

A thought came to her.

"Are you... Death?" Daphne asked timidly, gathering up the little amount of courage she could manage to find.

Aunty Elena had been so worried all this time, she remembered, and it wasn't so hard to put everything together and guess what might be wrong with her. She was a clever girl.

<br>

The shadow took another step closer to her, the girl retreated to the far corner of the room, arms wrapped around herself, holding tight together. Her eyes darted like a frightened sparrow's with wounded wings, so terrified and wanting to leave, but the wounds on the wings constrained it to the ground, only flapping the hurt wings pointlessly in the vain attempt of flying away.

"Yes." The shadow -- Death -- spoke. But it wasn't like how a human would speak, the voice was light but deep, as if it was passed directly into her mind without going through the ears, as if there was no sound at all but she could hear it all the same.

The kid blinked. Once. Twice. She wasn't going to cry, she thought to herself. She was just staring.

"... But don't be afraid, Daphne," Death told her, another step closer. Close enough for her to see the whole figure now. "I'm not here to take you."

Death held a hand toward her as if a mother soothing a sick baby. The little girl shrank back further, shivering. Death withdrew the hand before it reached her.

Daphne stared at the hand, then traced up the arm, looked into the empty dark space under the hood where a face was supposed to be, but she could find nothing.

"I need you to be strong for me," Death told her. "It's important for you, and more important for me. Do you understand?"

The kid nodded, even though she didn't quite understand. She uncurled slightly beneath the blanket.

"Now go back to your sweet dreams." A hand hovered on top of her forehead, and her eyes fluttered closed.

<br>

A warm, soft touch on her face woke her. Lucky huddled by her feet, and a hand was testing her temperature on her forehead.

A woman's voice sounded up right by her side before she opened her eyes. "Daphne, sweetie, how are you feeling?"

"Good, I think," she answered, meeting Aunty Elena's eyes.

"The heat got better, finally." Elena told her, giving her a small, relieved smile. "Anywhere still hurt?"

Daphne stretched her arms. They had some strength now, she realized, not much but some, something hadn't happened for a long time. She told Elena as much.

"That's good to hear. Must be all the rest and food we managed to get," Elena said, standing up and heading toward the door.

"Where are you going?" Daphne bent up her upper body, eyes following Elena.

"If you're well enough, we'd better get on the road soon," Elena said, halfway to the door, leaving only her back to the kid. "We might get to Old Henry's in a few days if we hurry."

She paused by the crumbly doorframe briefly, glancing back at the kid. "We can't stay here too long. Not safe, and we need more food and water. So, chop chop."

<br>

They were on the road shortly after. Daphne had a small schoolbag stuffed with the jumper that was used as her pillow and a few other clothes. Elena had a larger backpack with the blanket and some tins and cans.

Daphne managed to walk a few steps on her own, but soon started stumbling on the rocky road. Elena held her hands, steadying the kid. Lucky trotted several paces ahead of them, sniffing and scouting.

Bricks and rocks from the collapsed buildings made the path difficult to walk. Elena lifted her up sometimes, if the rubble was too high to climb. Other times, she pulled herself up, trying hard to keep up, panting.

There weren't many buildings still left standing on either sides, but the road was still roughly recognizable as a road. They headed south.

The trees and bushes were all grey and leafless, much like the buildings -- not many of them still standing, skeletons of what once was. The ones that did, the branches looked so fragile and lifeless that a single touch might turn all of them to ash, falling to the ground.

Daphne looked at them, the buildings and trees and the ground, wondering what had happened. She couldn't remember if it had always looked like that before she got sick. But there had surely been more people on the roads, then, and mom had been there. Now it almost felt like a bad dream that couldn't wake from.

She remembered that dream with the shadow last night. It had to be a dream.

She shook the hand being held by Elena, catching her attention. "I had a funny dream last night," she told her.

"Oh yeah?" Elena answered, eyes still looking ahead, attention on where they were going.

"There was this... this shadow," Daphne frowned to herself, starting at the rugged ground, trying to remember what she saw. "It was Death."

There was a pause in Elena's steps, but only for a brief moment. She kept walking, but glanced at Daphne now. "How do you know?"

"I asked, and it said yes," the kid answered lightly, like it was so obvious. "It had the whole outfit, like the books used to draw -- a big black cloak and a hood without a face."

The grip of hand tightened. Elena's eyes were intense on her. "Did it try to reap you?"

"No, actually." Daphne told her, almost cheerfully. "It was actually kind of nice. A little scary at first, but it didn't try to do anything to hurt me. And it told me not to be afraid."

"It talked to you?" Elena's eyes widened a little.

"Yeah, but I can't really remember." Daphne wrung her brows. "I think it also said something important, but I'm sorry, Aunty Elena, I can't remember what else it said."

Elena stopped, lowering down to look at her in the eyes. "It was just a dream," she told her, gaze sharp. "But if you ever dream about it again, try to wake up, or run away, or something. Ask it to come for me, if you have to. Just don't let it grab you, you hear me?"

Daphne nodded solemnly.

Elena patted her shoulder gently, then stood up, shooting a quick glance at the sky. "Now, let's keep moving, daylight's burning up fast."

Daphne looked at the sky too. It was shadowy and grey. Thick, dusty clouds blanketed the sky. There hadn't been much daylight to begin with.
