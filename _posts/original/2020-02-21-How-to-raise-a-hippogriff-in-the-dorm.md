## How to Raise a Hippogriff in the Dormitory: A Munual

### Warning

Keep this manual away from muggles!

### Definition

A hippogriff is a magical creature that has the head of a giant eagle and the body of a horse .

### Features

- Hippogriff is an intensely proud creature, so anyone who doesn’t want to die must show proper respect while approaching. It might attack if offended, so they are extremely dangerous with a magic classification of “XXX”.
- The diet of hippogriffs includes insects, birds, and small mammals. Worms sometimes are also acceptable if no other food is readily available.
- The daily routine of hippogriffs follows the movement of the sun. They would sleep and rest after sunset, and become active after sunrise. It is not suggested to mess their schedule, so those with a messed schedule themselves should pay more attention.
- Hippogriffs love the feeling of freedom and flying under the sun, so it is suggested to fly them at least once a day, as the saying goes, “Walk the dog, fly the hippogriff.” It is also acceptable to fly them after sunset for the consideration of hiding them from being seen by muggles.
- Hippogriffs are extremely loyal and enjoy accompany of those who they trust, so it is suggested to spend enough time to company them.
- Hippogriffs don’t have a strong preference of the living environment such as temperature and humidity. Anywhere that is bearable for human to live would be acceptable for hippogriffs.

### Challenges

- The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy  (also referred to as the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy) must be strictly followed. Magic and magical creatures such as hippogriffs must be strictly hidden from the muggles. The risk of exposure would increase more when raised in a dormitory due to the large student population nearby. Considering the size of hippogriffs and the difficulty of maintaining a Disillusionment Charm, the raiser is suggested to practice and master the Memory Charm in case muggles found out.
- The food supply of hippogriffs differs with regard to their age, size, and gender, but on average, a strong hippogriff that is in its young adulthood would consume from 87.5 to 262.5 pounds of feed daily . Get ready for the accumulatively large cost on the food supplies, and regularly check in to make sure you have a stable food supply chain that is separate from other resources. You certainly don’t want to find your hippogriff digging a nearby construction field looking for worms by its own when you come home.

### Benefits

- Hippogriffs are trustworthy friends, and they are extremely loyal.
- Hippogriffs can function as a protection of anything valuable at the home of their owner and be a personal defence of the wizard who lack a sense of security.
- Hippogriffs can fly with a speed that is faster than the fastest Nimbus Broomstick, so they are perfect transportations. However, using hippogriffs for personal transportation is illegal under the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.

### Suggestions

- The raise must at least gain a grade of “A” in the Dangerous Magical Creature Training Test.
- Practice Disillusionment Charm and Memory Charm.
- Fly the hippogriff only when you are sure it’s dark or the Disillusionment Charm is perfect.
- **Don’t** raise a hippogriff if you are not 100% sure you are capable and ready.

### Example user feedbacks

I lived with another witch roommate on campus. Both of us were spies sent to a same muggle university to learn their science and technique, and my hippogriff is an important documented transportation for us to arrive to the headquarters regularly. It is actually easier than I expected to raise a hippogriff inside my school housing dormitory, part of the reason might be my roommate is a fantastic cursor and zoologist. With her help, I don’t actually have to worry too much about problems like the food supplies, but my shared responsibility is to fly the hippogriff every day. 

It is always my most enjoyable time in a day. After a whole day of working, capturing and recording knowledge from the muggle professors, transmitting to the headquarters, and even having to finishing all the homework in time in order to pretend to be a better muggle student, by the time of sunset and going home, I would be so tired that all I wish to do is to lie down and sleep. And at these moments, after I double-checked all the charms to prevent discoveries, climbed on the back of my hippogriff, and soared into the night sky, my brain would become clear again all at once. Partially because of the low temperature in the mid-air, and the rest reclaimed energy comes from the sense of freedom. Also, since I trust my hippogriff full-heartedly, I don’t even need to worry that I might have the risk of falling from the sky, because I know my hippogriff would always reach me when I need.

Flying in a different time of the day or a different time of the year would offer different views. Luckily, the university that I need to spy on is in a city with perfect weather almost all year round, which means I could almost always see the clear sky without a cloud to spoil it. My favorite views are the star sky in the winters, when all the stars are so bright on top of me while my hippogriff hovering. I would feel Sirius is just hanging on tip of my fingers and the shiny belts in Orion is waiting for me to untie. 

The view of the city and of the sky is equally amazing at the time of sunset, though it is a lot riskier to fly the hippogriff while the sky is still burning red. In the rare cases when I took the risk to fly at this very moment, I could see how the burning color faded as time went by, and then I would impel my hippogriff to fly higher where the sun is not setting down yet, and review the whole process again. And I could also witness from the mid-air how the city lit itself gradually block-by-block, and finally the night took over the day, and the darkness hid every secret.
As a conclusion, for me, it is definitely one of the worthiest things to do to have my own hippogriff, and to have it accompanied me during my toughest years of spy career in a university.

For my case, I live alone in a studio in the university housing, and I treat my hippogriff mainly as a friend and a company. I was arranged to participate in a five-year-long humanity program in this muggle university, as part of the research task for the muggle study back home. During the program, I have to be highly alerted all the time to hide my identity of being a witch and always carefully erase all the traces of magic behind me, and the best suggested way to prevent exposure is to trust nobody and interact with fewer people. As a result, I don’t have many friends, and I would be easily distressed and overwhelmed due to trivial mistakes or imperfection in the task. 

Luckily, I persuaded my mom to take my hippogriff with me, who has always been there as my best friend and listener, since he is the only one here who can share my burden of carrying all these secrets. From my perspective, we are as if equal beings, so I didn’t personally like the idea of riding on his back and flying him somewhere. Therefore, normally I would just open the door near the time of sunset, allowing him to fly wherever he likes, and come back whenever he prefers. Interesting enough, he nearly always come back when I finished preparing his dinner. I never know whether it’s because he could smell the foods from miles away, it is the connection between our hearts and minds that calls him back.

I would especially reply on him during the midterm or final’s weeks. After all, I’m just a Hufflepuff, not a Ravenclaw. At the time when the exams coming closer yet I still can’t figure out what the textbook is talking about, and have already stayed up for too many nights, he would quietly come to my side and peck my hairs using his beak as a comfort. All I need to do is to bury my face in his feathers and hug him tightly, feel the warmth from his body whole-heartedly, knowing that it’s ok to not performing perfectly in these tasks and I’m always loved.

I’ve always been so glad that I have him during my difficult times and in my life. I can’t imagine how can I face all those depressed moments on my own. And I had always wanted to express my appreciation in a language that he can understand. Well, I think he already understood it. He is hugging me right now.
