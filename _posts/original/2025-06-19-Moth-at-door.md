A moth died knocking at my door -- no, she just fell asleep thinking what to say when I open the door.

The door knocker is like a knight, guarding her dream.

She was turned to a moth the moment she knocked at my door. And she didn't know what to do -- so she fell asleep on the knocker, just thinking, wondering, terrified, troubled. She needs my help, but I don't even know her name. At least I noticed her. And didn't kill her for being there.

Beware of my door, dangerous, cursed, bewitched, might change you into a sleep-deprived moth if you approach it with sick intention.

The door is jealous. Everyone knock at it, pass through it, but no one notice her. She's angry, she wants to punish. The loneliness is unbearable, poisonous, turning to vicious. The moth is the first to notice, and first to fall for her. She chooses to stay there for her, not just passing through, but actually stay on her, with her.
