Detachment and derealization makes it so much easier to endure pain. You can't hurt someone that isn't here, isn't it? And you can't break something that is not real.

Just another way to handle the pain, I guess. Except this time, the handle means you run away. You don't feel unhappy, not anxious, not depressive, because, hell, you're not even here, that's why you feel nothing, just empty, shallow. Just a body function as pre-programmed, that's why you said everything you're doing is just muscle memory, because, it is just that, the brain, the thought and feeling, the control center, they are not here.

Where are they? Where are you? You're not here, you're so lost again, but come back, you can't just run away from the feelings. You don't want to feel the pain again, not feel the anxiety and depression, but you need to. The pain makes life real, the runaway makes life a dream.

Where are you? Is it because you know there are too much overwhelming pain out there you can't handle? You know it's unsafe out there so you make a bubble for yourself and decide to close your eyes and shut your ears and sleep?

Does that mean unless the out here become safe again, you'll never come back again? Does that mean I have to either change the life or wait for the life change itself to be safer for you to come back?

所以之前有意识的detach终究还是反噬了。为了工作的最高效，每天在上班时把自己的各种情绪情感都block出去，都detach出去，只剩下理智部分维持必要智力活动进行工作，然后在下班之后再把情绪部分领回来很多次都感到，block得太严重导致领回来的部分都有些迟钝了，情绪迟缓地回来，在情绪回来前只有一种行尸走肉的空洞感。而现在，情绪部分、真正attach的部分，彻底离家出走了。于是找回来之前，便完全持久地处于detach状态了，失真，而理智……因为indifferent也开始愈发减少逐渐放弃原本pre-program好的流程了。果然任何technique都会反噬。
