Carol stretches her arms, movement big and exaggerated, shifting all the muscles on her shoulder.

"Think I'm gonna grow a pair of wings." She says, feeling the change of shape on her back around shoulder blade. It's sour and tight there.

"No, you're not." Tristan says, looking up from his book. "I'll know if you do."

"How would you know?" Carol looks at her, eyes cunning, sparkling with slyness.

Tristan laughs, "Hello? You know me first day? Nice to meet you, I'm Tristan, I'm a raven."

Carol laughs too, "But being a raven doesn't make you an expert in all birds."

Tristan raises his brows. "Excuse me? But I'm the only one with wings here, so no offence, of course I'm an expert."

"But being a raven only makes you an expert in ravens, but not *all* the birds." Carol argues, "Say, what if I'm going to grow a pair of wings and become an eagle?"

"You want to become an eagle?" I ask her. Amazed, but not exactly surprised.

"Sure, why not?" She smiles at me.

"Not... I don't know, seagull?" That's the second thing popped in my mind. Eagle is the first, and feels natural too.

"What, so I can eat French fries from your hand?" She laughs.

I imagine the picture, laughing with her. "No, but you love sea. We all love sea."

"I can always fly near the sea as an eagle." she says, "I'd read it somewhere, the sea eagle or something, always build their nest on the seaside cliff."

"It suits you." I admit.

"Or falcon." she considers. "So much freedom and so much sky."

"Always something big, huh?" Tristan chips in.

"I'm not gonna eat you, rest assured." she laughs, "Promise."

"I won't worry." Tristan closes his book, "Benefit of being small, I can actually fly faster than you."

"No, you're not." Carol straights her face, offended.

"Pretty sure I can." Tristan doesn't let go.

I cough. They look at me, forgot about the fight already.

"What 'bout you?" Carol asks me. "Something big and free? Fly alongside me?"

I try to imagine the picture, thinking how a pair of eagle wings would look like on me, on my back.

"What about owl?" Tristan suggests.

I frown, protesting. "Why do you guys get to be the cool ones that can be all fearsome or magical, but I'm the creepy one that sounds funny and look funny?"

"But you can get the biggest eyes!" Carol supplies, grinning. Now they're just teasing.

"And owls are magical too!" Tristan says, helping -- which he's totally not.

I look at him with straight face, "No, that only happen to Harry Potter."

"What about peacock?" He surrenders, only to hit a second time. "They can fly too. And beautiful."

I moan. "They have 'cock' in the name!"

Carol laughs so hard she rolls around on the grass, getting all the clipping pieces stick on her clothes.

I tell them, seriously. "I'd like to be albatross."

"Look at you," Carol says, still lying flat on the grass, "*big* is not enough, had to go with the *biggest*, aren't you?"

"Two meters of wing span, think about that, how cool would that be." I reason.

"You don't have to be birds to have wings, you know." Tristan opens a new train of thoughts.

"What 'bout bats!" Carol picks up what he must have been thinking immediately.

"Being a flying rat? No, thank you." I can't hold back my smile, none of us can.

"Come on, not *that* bad." Tristan says, "More like a flying black cat."

"That does make it sound better. More mysterious, more magical." Carol pretends to consider seriously.

I moan again. "They smell!"

The memory of walking inside a bat cave is still vivid enough. Especially the smell part.

"Alright," Tristan says, changing the direction again, "what about pterosaur? Big, fearsome, not smell -- hopefully, but no one knows for sure, we'll just pretend it doesn't, you won't, if you're one."

That's actually not that bad of an idea.

"And you get to be the oldest among all of us." Carol says, "Like, fossil-age old, ancient ancient pre-history old." She counts the fingers, pretending doing the math. "Like, next year can be your two hundred million years old birthday or something?"

Yeah, not helping.

We laugh so hard that all of us are almost breathless.

"They don't even have furs and feathers on the wings!" I give my reason of turning it down.

"Fair enough." Tristan says, eyes sparkling again with new ideas, splatting his book on the ground in his eureka moment, "Archaeopteryx! Here's your solution, ancient old, big, fearsome, still somewhat like dinosaur if you're into it, and definitely has furs and feathers."

"Why do I want to be ancient old again?" My face wince.

"Well, congratulations on your one hundred and fifty million years old then," Carol would never miss any chance of a joke, "you just got yourself fifty million years younger!"

There is another round of choking and coughing on laughter again.

"There are dinosaurs with feathers too, you know." Carol says, once we calm down a bit from that explosion of laughters.

"No, they're not dinosaurs." I counter, "That's called chicken."

"You do know that's a conspiracy theory, right?" Tristan follows. "So they can sell eggs the price of dinosaur eggs?"

I don't think any of us are able to catch up the breath from laughter for at least another five minutes.

"Yeah, no, thanks, but, no." I finally get my voice back from the laughter and decide, "I'll just go with albatross then."

They both nod.

"Nice one." Carol pats me on the shoulder, fingers tracing down my back, following the line of shoulder blade, as if feeling whether there are actually wings growing out from the bones beneath the skin.

"Anything fluffy there?" I look over my shoulder, asking.

"Sadly not yet." she says, her fingers are just wandering around my skin on the back now. I like how her touch feels like.

"Don't give up hope." Tristan says, picking up his book again. "Might happen some day, some birds don't know they can fly until certain age --"

I'm pretty sure he just made that up.

"-- so we don't know, maybe you'll just grow the wings after some age too."

"Like when a human live to two hundred years old, that's when it happens." Carol supplies.

I nod. Pretty sure that's the case.
