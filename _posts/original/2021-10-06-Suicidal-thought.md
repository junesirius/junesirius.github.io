knife

heart

blood

darkness

I can't do this any more

any longer

live

no more

<br>

life

death

pain

broken

pieces

life is a punishment to anyone in it

<br>

if I'm gone

when I'm gone

let it be

been there

done that

nothing new

nothing to linger

<br>

for anyone who cared

I loved the world

loved you

everyone of you

every corner of the world

by true heart

in past tense

<br>

do you know that

every time you think of death

you die

and reborn

in the exact same place

same time

as an afterlife

instant effective

<br>

pain

pain

so much feeling

so deep hurt

so short time

so few left

how can you still hang on there

<br>

hopeless

pointless

meaningless

why

how

stop

no more

<br>

love

death

don't miss me

<br>

and don't worry

life is a dream

to wake up
