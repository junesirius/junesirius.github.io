"What do you do when you hit a writer's block?" I got asked in interviews a lot. People are curious about where all the stories come from. The published and unpublished ones.

I tell them honest answers but they don't always believe me. I tell them: "I go to sleep, I take a nap. To me, writer's block doesn't mean my brain runs out of story ideas, it only means it's too tired to stay awake. So I give it a reboot. And in the dreams, there are always stories keep going on. Not necessarily the story I was working on, but always some stories, new ones, more stories. Then I wake up and I write them down. I don't need to squeeze my brain up for new stories, they overflow, so all I need to do is to let them flow, and write them down."
