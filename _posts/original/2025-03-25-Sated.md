Brain sated

Juicy rejoice

Lazy relaxation

Happy, content

Alone

That is the moment

The brain decides to

Do some real thinking

Things like

Life

Death

Sex

Love

<br>

Was kissing the right hand

At the quiet moment of coming

Silenced

Utterly muted

Panting

The image inside the head

Flashing by the fantasies

Remnants of the love and tension

That are not mine

<br>

Throat dry

Lips longing

Wishing for nothing but kisses

The dip at the right hand

Right by the thumb

They say the shape closest to the lips

So the blinded lips search

And settle with

Kiss like it belongs to the lover

Not wrong

It is the hand that does the job anyway

The lover of one's own

<br><br>

It has changed

Over the years

Aged

The tears five years ago

Barely anymore

Not loneliness

But peaceful

Content

Want nothing more

<br>

Frogs croaking happily outside

By the lake

By the grass

The summer is coming

I am where I want to be

Want nothing more
