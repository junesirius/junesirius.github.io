Never write with pen and ink

The ink is never black

They are red

They are transparent

They are salty

They are blood and tears

<br>

I cut myself open

The silver blade remains in the chest

Deep

shuddering

right to the center of the heart

prevent blood from splashing

just dripping

drop by drop

endlessly

The heart is still beating

fast

like that of a dying bird

<br>

The blood is flowing

all over

red everywhere

make the perfect ink

for a good story

In the story

everyone carries a blade

on their hearts

wounded

hurt

broken

and in pain

<br>

How can they not be

Since the ink is blood and tears

<br>

Not really want to heal

How else can I find a better ink
