The other day, I looked in the mirror and asked myself what I *really* want to do, in the future maybe, in a world I don't need to worry about anything, not the immigration status, not the money, not anything. What would I want to do.

The me in the mirror told me, I'd like to be a screenwriter and a novelist. If not in the alternate universe, then in ten years.

And maybe go back to school as well. And learn and research about brains and dreams and physics and reality. About everything I can learn but don't have time to.

If time is limitless and I can do anything, there are so much I want to do.

But in ten years.

Not now, not the me in front of the mirror.

<br>

Remembered there was this old story I read when I was a kid, maybe about ten or fifteen? The story I can still remember to this day because I had once used it as my weapon to persuade my family for something I wanted to do so badly back then.

The story had an old man living a normal peaceful reputable life, earning the living, having a wife, with 401k and everything of an apple pie life. And then, he retired, he started digging into what he realized he *really* liked. He went deep into Buddhism, went to the temples and pilgrimage journeys. He was obsessed and that was all he could think of doing everyday of life. And because he was retired, he had the luxury of doing those, and nobody would think it's weird.

And then there was this other young man, twenties, right out of school, without a job, without a life, and *he* had an obsession of Yetis. He went into the deep mountains and the wilderness to look for the Yetis because it was his dream, he loved it and he believed they're real. He lived outside of the human community, got himself all dirty and wild for living days and months in the wild, people disgust him, his friends and family got distant. Everyone just thought he went nuts and it was a joke.

The young me read the story, touched and inspired, using it as my reasoning. I remember telling my family: "If the man wanted to do something *really bad*, then why wait? Why waste the whole life waiting for it only to do the one thing you love and really is your dream after you almost finished living your life? So I'll be that young man, not waste my life, go pursuing my dream right now, not waiting."

I don't even remember what's that *thing* back then I was trying so hard to protect that I believed I *really* wanted to do, the thing I believed it was the dream and love of my life.

I don't even remember now.

<br>

But I'm not me anymore. Apparently.

Because the me now, only wrote that sentence ten minutes ago: I know what I want, but I'll wait. I'll wait another ten years to start pursuing that one thing I know I really love to do. The writing, the screenplays, the novels. And the dreams, among others.

Why wait?

Because I'm already on the old man's path. Because I can't risk giving up this "normal" life I have now, the life I've spent so much to build and finally making it decent and admirable, I can't throw that away like it's nothing. Because it's everything I have.

Guess that's what happened when you grow up and start to *have* something in your life. To actually *have* a life that *you* built, that is *yours*.

Guess when you only have much, as a kid, as a teen, as someone that didn't really start the life, you wouldn't mind risk losing everything and start from scratch. Press the reset button once or twice. Then when you do, when the fortunes start building, when you start having a nice house and car and job, especially if you have a wife and kid and the white fence apple pie life, not so much anymore.

What you have, becomes the chain that stops you from getting more. Getting what your heart maybe *really* wants. Stops the dream from becoming true, becoming part of the life.

That's why you have to wait. Wait until things are no risk of losing, wait for the retirement, wait for the new era when you have nothing again.

Guess that's why there are so many stories about people losing their everything to a fire or disaster or a divorce, that's when they start doing the real thing, pursuing the dreams, reaching the success. You can only gain more when you don't have anything left.

<br>

Guess I do get older now. "Grown up" might be an easier word to look at, but "older" is the same thing and more accurate thing to not sugarcoat what it really is.

Older in the mindset, older in the dream pursuit. Getting more worn out by the life itself, more tired, more attached to the boring adulthood mundane life that is not so inspiring and exciting. More drifting with the flowing stream without fighting.

Not sure this is the grown I had imagine back then ten years ago.

But on the bright side, the dreams aren't completely gone. Buried by the reality, it's still stubborn as Hell, trying its chance to take over. Checking out all the writings and readings and events, the dreams and researches that aren't quite technical but aren't quite forgotten. The sprout of rebellion, the stretch-out of a new tiny small lane path on the side of the main road.

Sometimes, they might just can coexist, living under the shadow of glamorous day job.

The dreams are still there.

Guess I'm not *too* old yet.
