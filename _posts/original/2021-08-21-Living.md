living

takes too much courage

so those who are still alive

are the bravest ones

for they are alive

those who are no longer alive

are also the bravest

for they were once alive

but

even a mouse knows who to survive

yet some are no more than a mouse

<br>

got up at five

baked a cake

cooked some porridge

tried so hard to live

to survive

to feel the life

yet

still feel like

as if

had never lived

at all
