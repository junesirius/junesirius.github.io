The pain comes back.

6 months, that's the longest time I can have, to enjoy a place, a kind of life, before the joy becomes the suffer, before running away to another place, another life.

3 months, that's as long as the pure happiness and excitement and ambition and enthusiasm can last, after that, things are going down, dopamine and epinephrine are running out.

And now, I finally can start writing again.

I asked once before, "without pain, how can I write."

Looks like I found the answer, the right answer is, "wait for pain to come back", because it will never leave for too long.

And I think I have found the most devastating thought I could have to haunt myself, which is "I'm not good enough." I'm not good enough, I'm not important enough, I'm not brilliant and talented and clever and hardworking and fast-learning enough.

Not good enough for what, that I don't know, for being happy, being free, being loved, being able to live the life and enjoy it.

That's the thought that almost destroyed me last time. Let's see how long I can survive this time.
