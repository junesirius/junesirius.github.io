run

run away from the goddamn world

from devils everywhere

from the life that is ticking down

like a sandglass upside down

<br>

run

run away from everything filthy

from things that are strangling the throat

squeezing the life out of the body

stopping the voice from flowing

<br>

run

run away from the cursed life

from your own image in the mirror

smash the glass

disturb the water

never look at any reflection again

otherwise

how can you truly run away

with your own eyes staring back

<br>

shadow of the night

blood from the nightingale

death flies down with black wings

where to run now

or shall we just embrace

the prince of the darkness
