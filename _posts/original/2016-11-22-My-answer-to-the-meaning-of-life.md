Life has no meaning like many people always say;

We choose to know the world follow our own taste;

The major we learn reflects the choice we made,

The aspects of world that we desire to embrace.

<br>

Life is about experiencing and memorizing.

Knowledge is paltry among infinite mysteries;

Process of studying is merely mental health practicing,

To prove the ability and potential of intelligence.

<br>

But the grading shall never be neglected,

For it determines the stage we shall stand upon,

How miraculous life could ever become,

Before death what impressive memory to be recalled.

<br>

Through all the experience, we are abandoning while still searching;

For the answer to the meaning, that we never know before the ending.
