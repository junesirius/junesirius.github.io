Crowley: Why do you hate me, mother?

Rowena: Because if I don't, I'll love you. But I'll remember the time when I was nothing but weak and dying.

<br>

Now I understand. If I don't, I won't be as far away from the past me as I can. cuz if I don't, I'll be as trapped and painful and weak as I was. I need power to run away, I need a reason, and so that's the reason I tell myself.

That's why I cried hard at the night of Thanksgiving missing you but I don't even want to give you a call. That's why I play cool and remote when I called, and rushed away. Because if I don't, I'll tell you how much I missed you, how much I wanted you here, be with me, celebrate birthday and Thanksgiving and Christmas and new year and every goddamn holiday December has (and there are so many) with me. If I don't, I'll cry in front of the camera, and then you'll cry too, become three bags of sadness. Sad and soft and weak and sabby, and I hate that in me. So I choose the other way, the tough cool pretense, leave them hurt and left alone and wondering why. Tell myself that's because I'm still angry and mad and unforgiving even though it's long gone and already forgave. I let myself relive that night over and over again, remind myself how hurt I was, how hurt I still am, the pain, the shame, the desperation, everything. And I tel myself, I cannot forget, I cannot forgive, and I cannot go back. I tell myself, I need the hate and anger, I need it and that's the only way moving ahead.

I was so angry. I still am. But for so long I don't know that's how angry feels like, because I so rarely get to feel it that the feeling is strange. But I am, actually, just as angry and pissed as Claire and Dean and all those who have anger-control issues. Turns out, I do too. Maybe not snapping as much, but definitely deep in there, fierce enough to be cruel. I'm just as emotionally constipated as all my beloved characters. No wonder I know them like I know myself. Because that's exactly me.

But Cass told Dean, you're not what you think you are. You see yourself the way our enemy see you, but not how your loved ones see you. You're full of love, you do everything out of love. You care about the world, so I care. He should have told him earlier, way earlier than too late, and Cass, you really should come tell me that too because I need to hear it. From you or from someone love me the way you love Dean.

Love is the best cure for the anger disguised as hate.

I know it, but I'm not letting myself feel it.

<br>

We used to fight so much, we still do. We can't talk more than two sentences without turning into an argument. Just like how Sam and John is. Just because how similar they're like. We fight, because we're the same. How funny I never really realize that until I see someone in some show be the exact same way to see myself.

Now it's so easy to understand why I rushed away: the same way Dean Winchester would run away when he sensed any hint of sabby intimacy chick-flick moment coming up. Intimacy scares us.

We didnt't even get photos. We did every year but just now this year. Alright, I totally messed it up, ain't I?

I'm gonna regret this. I'm sure I will. But I'm not gonna say it, I'll just let it stew in me, and slowly making myself miserable.

PS: Full quotes between Crowley and Rowena (SPN S11E10):

> Crowley: Mother, why do you hate me?
>
> Rowena: I hate you, because when I look into your eyes I see the woman I used to be, before magic, before the coven... when I was nothing but Rowena, the tanner's daughter... a pale, scared little girl, who smelled of filth and death.
>
> Rowena: I hate you, because when you were born, your father said he loved me, then he went back to his grand wife and his grand house, whilst I lay pathetic and half dead on a straw mat... my thighs slick with blood.
>
> Rowena: I hate you, because if I didn't, I'd love you. But love... love is weakness. And I'll never be weak again.
