The storm is coming

The storm is coming

Can you not see

The black cloud on the horizon

Can you not hear

The wind is becoming hurricane

<br>

The storm is coming

The storm is coming

The water is trembling

The land is shaking

Can you not smell

The blood in the air

And the lava uprising

From the bottom of sea

<br>

The sun is not rising

The moon is crying

The storm is coming

The storm is coming

<br>

Why are you still standing by the sea

Looking at the east

Sun is no more

Moon is the past

Wake up

Wake up

The storm is coming
