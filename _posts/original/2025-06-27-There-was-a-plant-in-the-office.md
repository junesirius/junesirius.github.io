There was a plant in the office. On the edge of the window frame, where the sunlight could shine in.

It sat there, bathed in the afternoon sun, shaking slightly with its white flower.

I think it's a type of orchid. But after all, I'm no botanist, and for some reason, for the three years being there, I never thought about taking a photo of it or searching its name online. So I would never know now if it's an orchid or not. It's just a plant to me with long green leaves that looked like tentacles and a lone white flower that seemed to be there forever.

I used to water it once a week. There was a small measuring cup at the edge of the pot, and a small butterfly-shaped sticky sign half-way stuck in the soil, saying something probably along the line of "Water me, once a week." I think that's how I know I should water it once a week. Usually first thing Monday morning.

I know that small sign is sticky because one day, there was a dead flying bug on there -- my knowledge of insects was as limited as vegetations, so a bug with small transparent wings was all I could identify. I thought about removing the sign and washing it clean. But then I almost got my finger stick to it, like the flying bug. I left it there.

I don't think there were many people noticing the plant. The window it sat by was near the refrigerator at the threshold of the kitchen -- which has the biggest collection of bad-smelled coffee and instant food, and a full fridge of chilling zero sugar coke. The office and server room was in the other direction. The desk in front of the window was mostly used for hosting the take-outs when they were delivered.

The plant just sat there, sinking in the mixed flavor of sugarless coke, instant noodle, cheap coffee, and take-outs of Indian or Chinese food -- and maybe on a good day, Mediterranean food. Sometimes when I waited in a line picking my food, I looked at its leaves that were too long, dragged to the soil by its own weight and dirtied by the dirt, and I wondered whatever contribution it made to the carbon cycle, if it would be enough to clean the air of the smell from last week's pizza or burger -- that may still had its leftover in the bottom tray of the fridge, and a greasy smear on the desk to prove its existence, where the fortune cookies were currently scattered upon.

(TBC)

(next: newly installed cameras, computers, hinted high-techs and start edging toward sci-fi, but still keep focus on the plant, only hinting the rest setups, learning from Black Mirror)

(inspired by destiel botanic story and recently finished Black Mirror, has potential to merge real events of the company development with the plant, a little bit like Neil Gaiman style)

(the plant witness everything, the plant get infected by the high-tech AI stuff and get conscious and intelligence, a bit exaggerated sci-fi vibe, something from the plant's conscious enter network, the start-up doesn't work out in the end)
