Finally realized why I've stopped writing for quite some time.

Or rather, why I suppressed my writing.

Because I'm afraid of my words. Afraid of what might end up turning up under my pens.

Those words I end up writing down, usually not because I want to or plan to put them down, they just come out by themselves.

They are honest. They are real. And that's why I fear them. I fear my own uncontrollable honesty. Because I don't want to find out I'm faking my own life. I don't want to know I'm not happy, or feel lonely, or sad, or hurt. But words always know. Maybe I can cheat my brain to believe I'm good and happy and fine, but I can never cheat my words.

That's why I stop my word. Stop the honesty, so I can keep faking, keep pretending as if my life is as perfect as my stories.

But I already know the truth.

And I know my stories are never perfect, or happy ending.
