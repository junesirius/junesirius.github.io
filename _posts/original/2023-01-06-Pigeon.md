路边死去的鸽子

每次走过那条路时总会想起它

can never forget it now

永远不会知道它为什么会在那里

will wonder forever

总要写一写的

<br>

<hr>

<br>

There was a dead dove by the road

Was there once

Years ago

Haven't been there for ages

After rains and suns and snows

The road forgets about it

Not even the slightest trace left behind

<br>

I'm still thinking about it

Every time passing that road

I'd think about it

Can never forget it now

<br>

Will never know why it was there

Will wonder forever

<br>

I'll write about it

One day

Some time

Those dazed eyes looking at the sky

One last time

<br>
