If I draw the creature to one extreme of the castle, and I run to the other extreme, I can earn myself a maximum of 82 minutes. 82 minutes to eat, sleep, and work. After that, you can hear its breathing again. And you need to run again. It never walk faster, and never leave you. One day, if you sleep too deep, or walk too slow, or just you're too tired, it catches up with you. And you have nowhere to run.

——DW 911

feels exactly the same when I'm running testing experiments. I have to run it for exactly 77 minutes, so in between, I have 77 minutes to eat, to play, to do anything, to live. When the time is up, when the reminder goes off, I'll have to come back, to run, to deal with it. And then have another 77 minutes to live again.

### Appendix/Extract:

As you come into this world, something else is also born. You begin your life, and it begins a journey... towards you. It moves slowly, but it never stops. Wherever you go, whatever path you take, it will follow. Never faster, never slower, always coming. You will run, it will walk; you will rest, it will not. One day, you will linger in the same place too long, you will sit too still, or sleep too deep. And when, too late, you rise to go, you will notice a second shadow next to yours. Your life will then be over.

<br>

But... I can't actually see a way out of this... I've finally run out of corridor. There's a life summed up. Now, this is new, I'm scared. I just realized that I'm actually scared of dying.

<br>

Sorry, I'm late! Jumped out of a window. Certain death. Don't you want to know how I survived? Go on. Ask me!

No, of course I had to jump! The first rule of being interrogated is that you are the only irreplaceable person in the torture chamber. The room is yours, so work it. If they're going to threaten you with death, show them who's boss. Die faster! You've seen me do that more often than most. Isn't that right, Clara?

Rule one of dying - don't. Rule two - slow down. You've got the rest of your life. The faster you think, the slower it will pass. Concentrate! Assume you're going to survive. Always assume that. Imagine you've already survived. There's a storm room in your mind. Lock the door and think! This is my storm room. I always imagine that I'm back in my Tardis, showing off, telling you how I escaped, making you laugh. That's what I'm doing right now. I am falling, Clara. I'm dying. And I'm going to explain to you how I survived. I can't wait to hear what I say. I'm nothing without an audience.

Can't I just sleep?

Do I have to know everything?

"How are you going to WIN?"

Clara, I can't always win...

<br>

It keeps coming, Clara. Wherever I go, it follows. Why? Why does it do that?

"Wrong question."

Always the teacher. What's the right question, then?

"Not why. What?"

It's following me. Wherever I go, it's tracking me. Slowly though. Scary lurching. Scary! These screens everywhere... It's showing me exactly where it is all the time, how far it's got, how near. Because it is trying to scare me! Putting its breath on my neck. That's the point! That's what it's doing. This is theatre! It's all about fear.

Working hypothesis - I'm in a fully automated haunted house. A mechanical maze. It's a killer puzzle box designed to scare me to death, and I'm trapped inside it. Must be Christmas!

<br>

Well, that was another close one. Or it would be, once I've been and gone and got myself out of it. So, how am  I going to do that? Come on, teacher, ask me questions!

"Tell no lies."

"What did you say that made the creature stop?"

The truth, yes. But not any old truth, Clara. This whole place is designed to terrify me. I'm being interrogated. It's not just truth it wants. That's not enough. It's confession. I have to tell truths I've never told before. That's the only thing that stops it.

You see, the problem is, Clara, there are truths that I can never tell. Not for anything.

But I'm scared and I'm alone.

Alone...

And very, very scared.

<br>

I confess...

I didn't leave Gallifrey because I'm bored! That was a lie! It's always been a lie! I was scared! I ran because I was scared!

<br>

It's funny, the day you lose someone isn't the worst. At least you've got something to do. It's all the days they stay dead.

<br>

This is how my world works, Clara. I tick off the seconds as they pass. My life is a countdown.

If I draw the creature to one extreme of the castle, and I run to the other extreme, I can earn myself a maximum of 82 minutes. 82 minutes to eat, sleep, and work.

Every room, if I leave it long enough, reverts to its condition at the moment I arrive. It tidies up after itself. Automated room service.

I think this whole place is inside a closed energy loop, constantly recycling. Or maybe I'm in Hell? That's OK. I'm not scared of Hell. It's just Heaven for bad people.

But how long will I have to be here?

Forever?

<br>

It's always coming. Always closer. The countdown never stops. But the countdown to what?

There are two events in everybody's life that nobody remembers, two moments experienced by every living thing. Yet, no one remembers anything about them. Nobody remembers being born, and nobody remembers dying. Is that why we always stare into the eye sockets of a skull? Because we're asking, "What was it like? Does it hurt? Are you still scared?"

<br>

Azbantium. 400 times harder than diamond. 20 feet thick. The way out.

Bird!

That's when I remember! Always then. Always... then. Always EXACTLY then! I can't keep doing this, Clara! I can't! Why is it always me? Why is it never anybody else's turn?!

"How are you going to WIN?"

Can't I just lose? Just this once?! Easy. It would be easy. It would be SO easy. Just tell them. Just tell them, whoever wants to know, all about the Hybrid. I can't keep doing this. I can't. I can't always do this! It's not fair! Clara, it's just not fair! Why can't I just lose?!

"NO!"

But I can remember, Clara. You don't understand, I can remember it all. Every time.

And you'll still be gone.

Whatever I do, you still won't be there.

"Doctor, you are not the only person who ever lost someone. It's the story of everybody. Get over it. Beat it. Break free. Doctor, it's time. Get up, off your arse... And win!"

<br>

Hello again. No more confessions, sorry. But I will tell you... the truth. The Hybrid is a very dangerous secret. A very, very dangerous secret and it needs to be kept. So I'm telling you nothing. Nothing at all. Instead, I'm going to do something far worse. I'm going to get out of here, and find whoever put me here in the first place, and whatever they're trying to do, I'm going to stop it!

But it might take me a little while, so do you want me to tell you a story? The brothers Grimm, lovely fellas, they're on my darts team.

According to them, there's this emperor, and he asks this shepherd's boy: "How many seconds in eternity?"

<br>

People always get it wrong with Time Lords. We take forever to die. Even if we're too injured to regenerate, every cell in our bodies keeps trying. Dying properly, can take days. That's why we like to die among our own kind. They know not to bury us early.

I think, in my current condition, it'll take me about a day and a half to reach the top of the tower. I think, if I'm lucky, I have a day and a half. I have to do this, Clara. It's the only way. I have to be strong. I should have known from the very beginning. Of course. The portrait of you, the creature from my own nightmares, this place is my own, bespoke torture chamber. Intended for me only. And all those skulls in the water, how could there be other prisoners in my hell? The answer, of course, is there never were any other prisoners. And the stars, they weren't in the wrong place, and I haven't time travelled. I've just been here a very, very long time.

How long can I keep doing this, Clara?

Burning the old me, to make a new one?

<br>

"How many seconds in eternity?"

And the shepherd's boy says: "There's this mountain of pure diamond. It takes an hour to climb it, and an hour to go around it. Every hundred years, a little bird comes, and sharpens its beak on the diamond mountain. And when the entire mountain is chiselled away, the first second of eternity will have passed!"

You must think that's a hell of a long time. Personally, I think that's a hell of a bird.
