If you lure it to one end of the castle and run very fast to the other end, you will have 83 minutes of time. You use those 83 minutes to eat, to bath, to sleep, to do anything, to live. After that, you can hear its breathing again. And you need to run again. It never walk faster, and never leave you. One day, if you sleep too deep, or walk too slow, or just you're too tired, it catches up with you. And you have nowhere to run.

feels exactly the same when I'm running testing experiments. I have to run it for exactly 77 minutes, so in between, I have 77 minutes to eat, to play, to do anything, to live. When the time is up, when the reminder goes off, I'll have to come back, to run, to deal with it. And then have another 77 minutes to live again.
