Every time you are here, I love you a little more.

Not even I know how's that possible.

Every time you leave, I start dreaming about you again.

Every time.

Believe it or not, I [once](https://junesirius.github.io/2022/05/24/Love-no-more) wrote "I decide to stop loving you, starting today." Something something about self-esteem and self-worth and not deserve to be loved, something something about not wanting to become third wheel accidentally and ready to move on.

Something that can't simply be "decided."

Of course it has to continue exist. And of course it has to be suppressed.

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Let it brew in the dark corner of that heart that doesn't know how to be honest and open and vulnerable to intimacy. Let it grow but never blossom for the sunshine can't reach inside. It's terrifying, it's confusing. So the brain decides, just pack everything in a box and stuff it at the bottom of the head.Is the definition and clarification appearing the first time, this time round? The word "friend" comes, so it's defined, the hovering intimacy settled. It's freedom, and it's jail. Nothing grows above it, nothing has to.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">For the record, this is taught by Dean Winchester. "You're my best friend." He always says that about Cas. The safest definition. Probably really shouldn't have learned about how to handle feelings from the world's biggest emotional constipated idjit. Always so blind to see, always doesn't allow himself to believe. Ain't I the same?</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">But really, it is indeed the safest term to use. The easiest. For a coward.</p>

<br>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Could have been so many possibilities. So much fantasies. So little time. So much fear.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">So many words unable to let out. And some finally did, and it astonished me.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">For near ten years the things I wasn't able to talk about with anyone, not the closest friend I've known for ten years, not therapists or psychiatrists, not even my own goddamn diary. I just couldn't. The words and letters just swirl in my brain, looping round and round and I couldn't get them out, couldn't ever, 'cause that was the agreement, one that was never forgotten even when I force myself pretend to.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">And eventually, they got out, and that's with you. It took fours years of knowing to fully trust like that. It took a drive after midnight to let mental guard down. It is the first time realize driving in quiet dark night is such a good time for confession, for difficult conversations. The reasonable mind would be occupied by driving, and eyes wouldn't need to look at the other, only at the front, at the empty road. Half the focus on the road, the background honest self could finally have their voice out. And the space is intimate, inside the car, it's like inside one's own home, it's personal, it's private, it's comfortable, it feels safe. The passenger seat is close, but not too close. The shotgun can reach and touch, but also barricaded by the handlers. The exact right amount of good distance. It's *the* most perfect place for difficult conversations. (I should write more stories just from this realization.)</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Should I feel surprised, of all the people in my life, of all the people in the world, you are the only one I could ever talk about sex and death, and sometimes even in the same sentence. How did I even have the luck of knowing you, I asked. And I love your answer right then: "I'm not going to die." See, the death talk again. Love it.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Even you were fluttered by my tears and honesty, so rarely, even with a troubled distracted mind I could tell that much. How many times you'd see vulnerability like you witnessed that night in me? How many times you've seen someone as screwed and messed up like me? I'd bet even as calm and supporting as you appeared to be, you were fluttered, uneasy, unsure of what might be the right things to say to me, for I was in such delicate vulnerable state, anything might unintentionally hurt me more than the past already did. And that might push me away and shut me off completely. I wouldn't believe it if that never crossed your mind and that didn't fear you. But in the end, everything worked out perfectly. Everything you said, everything you did, the simple fact of you just being there, for me, with me, that's enough for me. More than enough, that's all I ever wanted. That's all that I can think of wanting for anyone in this world, and you gave it to me. For that, I can never be more thankful.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">I'm still surprised, when you hold me tight, feeling the soft warmth, tears just start streaming down, unable to stop. It gets worse when you are just so sensitive and mind-reading too, asking quietly "You okay?" Even if I said yes, you'd continue with "You sure?" For you knew how much I'd like to hide and lie about being okay when I'm not actually. Isn't it what people say? That they're okay even if they're not?</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Even when we were outside, even when I'm pretty sure the mask is well and intact, the forced smile and calm are professionalized and perfected, you'd still check in time to time. You could tell. Never see anyone else read me so easily. Never felt more seen before. You see me.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">That's exactly why in your hold, I break apart. My heart knows, it is safe to cry now, it is safe to break apart, to be vulnerable, to shed tears, to be so emotionally naked. Because you can see already, with or without my forced managed walls. I was seen, so I don't have to keep myself composed any more. In front of you, I'm the real me.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Isn't there a similar quote somewhere too: "Love isn't just for you to love someone else, it's more about love the version of you when you're with them." Think I understand that now.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">And the real me indulged myself, letting myself feel the warmth, just a little longer; feel the tight hold, just a little longer. For those will probably be the only memories of warmth I can still get a hold of for months and years to pass, until our next reunion, if there is one.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">For fear of disappointment, I keep the hope low. DW taught me well enough: "Every Christmas might be the last Christmas. Every time you see someone might be the last time you see them." Didn't tell you that, but when I looked at you long and painful, when I so desperately try to imprint your figure into my brain, that's what's been repeating in my head: "This might very easily be the last time I see you ever again. So remember this. Remember you." For memory would be all I can ever have. And I cherish every little thing.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Even then, I couldn't let myself speak what I really really wanted to say.</p>

<br>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Want to guess why every time in your embrace, by your ear, with tears in my eyes, all I could ever say is "Thank you", no matter how much I want to say "I love you"?</p>


<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Want to guess why even in my writing, I can't write my characters let those three words out, not unless they're dead or dying? The last one just recently completely, even after the lines are written, they're taken out from the final draft eventually.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Not even for characters I know they love each other with their lives, I couldn't let them say that. The moment never felt right. Not because they are cheesy. But too difficult.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">It's too real, too powerful, and it's too terrifying. It's like cutting your heart out and presenting it to the person you say it to. It's bleeding. It's what love looks like in my eyes.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">It just can't happen. I can't see it happen, can't imagine it happen. Not in my life, real or fictional. Not in me, not in my characters.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Guess that's just one extra tiny small thing among many to have a glimpse of how messed-up and broken I am.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">I don't think I could ever be fixed again. Ever be whole and mentally healthy and open and genuinely believe I deserve to be loved and happy life, ever. I don't think I could be healed again, not alone. And I don't think it could happen in any time less than ten years. And there just wouldn't ever be such a person in the world that'd be patient enough to spend tens of years of their lives for me like that. Not like I could find an angel watching over me like Castiel. I just don't think so. So yeah, that's my belief, and that's why I accepted the fate that I might never be truly happy in my life or have a happily-ever-after type of love-of-my-life. And I'm okay with it.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">I have good enough friends like you in my life already. That's already all I'd ever wanted for my life, for emotional support, for handling the pains and loneliness and yearning.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">Did I ever mention all those small open display of fondness of yours are how big of a comfort for me? The constant affirmation of being seen, being cared about, being loved. I soaked myself in it like taking in the sunshine. Miraculously some of these actions are even mentioned in the best (and most angsty) destiel stories, the smallest comforting touch at the back of the neck. Unbelievably it's magic, it's soothing, and it replies so so much on trust and love. Just one touch, and all those emotions are passed through. How can I not be jealous of the girl you love and decide to spend your life with?</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">How can I not start waiting for the day we meet again since the day we part?</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">I don't think I'd meet anyone like you ever again. And I am so grateful to have met you.</p>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">I'd never stop wondering: How did I ever have the luck of meeting you?</p>

<br>

<p style="color: #0000; text-indent: 2em">(PS: Why do I have to hide everything from plain display? The rawness of admitting anything still fears me, even if I promise myself this is a safe space, even if I promise to be completely honest with myself in my own space, and I'd be the only one reading it. It still scares me. Emotions and love, they scare me.)</p>
