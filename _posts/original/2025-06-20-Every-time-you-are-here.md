Every time you are here, I love you a little more.

Not even I know how's that possible.

Every time you leave, I start dreaming about you again.

Every time.

Believe it or not, I once wrote "I decide to stop loving you, starting today." Something something about self-esteem and self-worth and deserve to be loved, something something about not wanting to become third wheel accidentally and ready to move on.

Something that can't simply be "decided."

Of course it has to continue exist. And of course it has to be suppressed.

Let it brew in the dark corner of that heart that doesn't know how to be honest and open and vulnerable to intimacy. Let it grow but never blossom for the sunshine can't reach inside. It's terrifying, it's confusing. So the brain decides, just pack everything in a box and stuff it at the bottom of the head.

Is the definition and clarification appearing the first time, this time round? The word "friend" comes, so it's defined, the hovering intimacy settled. It's freedom, and it's jail. Nothing grows above it, nothing has to.

For the record, this is taught by Dean Winchester. "You're my best friend." He always says that about Cas. The safest definition. Probably really shouldn't have learned about how to handle feelings from the world's biggest emotional constipated idjit. Always so blind to see, always doesn't allow himself to believe. Ain't I the same?

But really, it is indeed the safest term to use. The easiest. For a coward.

<br>

Could have been so many possibilities. So much fantasies. So little time. So much fear.

So many words unable to let out. And some finally did, and it astonished me.

For near ten years the things I wasn't able to talk about with anyone, not the closest friend I've known for ten years, not therapists or psychiatrists, not even my own goddamn diary. I just couldn't. The words and letters just swirl in my brain, looping round and round and I couldn't get them out, couldn't ever, 'cause that was the agreement, one that was never forgotten even when I force myself pretend to.

And eventually, they got out, and that's with you. It took fours years of knowing to fully trust like that. It took a drive after midnight to let mental guard down. It is the first time realize driving in quiet dark night is such a good time for confession, for difficult conversations. The reasonable mind would be occupied by driving, and eyes wouldn't need to look at the other, only at the front, at the empty road. Half the focus on the road, the background honest self could finally have their voice out. (I should write more stories just from this realization.)

Should I feel surprised, of all the people in my life, of all the people in the world, you are the only one I could ever talk about sex and death, and sometimes even in the same sentence. How did I even have the luck of knowing you, I asked. And I love your answer right then: "I'm not going to die." See, the death talk again. Love it.

I'm still surprised, when you hold me tight, feeling the soft warmth, tears just start streaming down, unable to stop. It gets worse when you just so sensitive and mind-reading too ask "You okay?" Even when we were outside, even when I'm pretty sure the mask is well and intact, the forced smile and calm are professioned and perfected, you'd still check in time to time. You could tell. Never see anyone else read me so easily. Never felt more seen before. You see me.

That's exactly why in your hold, I break apart. My heart knows, it is safe to cry now, it is safe to break apart, to be vulnerable, to shed tears, to be so emotionally naked. Because you can see already, with or without my forced managed walls. I was seen, so I don't have to keep myself composed any more. In front of you, I'm the real me.

Isn't there a similar quote somewhere too: "Love isn't just for you to love someone else, it's more about love the self when you're with them." Think I understand that now.

And the real me indulged myself, letting myself feel the warmth, just a little longer; feel the tight hold, just a little longer. For those will probably be the only parts I can still get a hold of for weeks and months to pass, to jump into the next reunite again.

<br>

Want to guess why every time in your embrace, by your ear, with tears in my eyes, all I could ever say is "Thank you", no matter how much I want to say "I love you"?

Want to guess why even in my writing, I can't write my characters say those three words out, not unless they're dead or dying? The last one just recently completely, even as the lines are written, they're taken out eventually.

It just can't happen again in my life, real or fictional.

Guess that's just one tiny small thing among many to have a glimpse of how messed-up and broken I am.
