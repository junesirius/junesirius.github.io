Likes/Dislikes:

- Appear to like alcohol (being alcoholic), illegal homemade substance addict, but not really like them, just need the effect to clear the mind (or more like to block the mind)
- Like puzzles/mazes, solving them, outsmart arrogant people who think no one can solve or beat them makes her feel good about herself
- Like magic learning and experiments, she explored her abilities and trained herself all on her own and through trial and error. When come across new magic books or resources, she indulged herself in absorbing them, learning them, making herself powerful (though her goal wasn't to make herself powerful, just enjoy the learning process)
- Doesn't like to settle down, would feel like stuck. Usually move around a lot. Doesn't mind live off street.

Experience:

- Magic origin: born with it, in bloodline (that's why it terrifies her father before she learned control, her mom and sister both had magic too); also strengthened by self-learning and self-training, do a lot of experiments, very creative, invent potions and spells etc.
- growing up self-educated, great self-learning ability, witty. explore and learn together with her sister when she's still alive
- know about supernatural, had many past encounters with common supernatural beings including vampires, werewolves, angels, demons; had made demon deals, it's actually demon who want her service; see angel as yet another asshole supernatural being, no different than other monsters; doesn't believe in higher celestial control power, believe in magic
- abusive, traumatic childhood
- has a bigger sister Eliana, grow up together close, 1y older, also magical but not as talented as her, died when she's 12 (Joanna's 11, 1450), cause of death: failed magical ritual (the similar bonding ritual to the one used with Silas 200y later, but this first time tried to tie their lives together, to protect one would not die as long as the other lives, but ritual failed, become taking one's life to let the other be immortal, her sister made the move quicker to self sacrifice. so she died, and Joanna became immortal) Joanna blames herself for it ever since, thinking she's the one killed her
- mother died giving birth, because of her being a magical baby and unintentionally draining her mom's magic and life force when the infant Joanna's body was dying (if she's a normal baby she'd die and mother might live), so now she survived, and everyday she blamed herself for it, for just being alive. Joanna's life, both being born and being immortal took away the lives of the two most dear and important people in her life, that's where all the self-hatred come from.
- father abusive, not caring, ignorant, internally fear her, manipulative, angry, terrified, hate her existence, practically wants her dead, blame her for his bad luck and bad life
- run away from home at age 17 (1456), live off street ever since, leave England to wander around Europe then further to Asian/African land starting at age 21 (1460), wander for 30y (already learned ageless magic), stow away in ships during Columbus exploration (almost got thrown off ship in the trip, a pirate mermaid story), get to US in 1492, continue the wandering life
- occupation: dirty magical deals, underground business, necromancer for hire, work for money (for highest bidder)

Acquaintance with the vampire known as Silas:

- first met around 1655, separate around 1860s during Civil War because Joanna doesn't want to join the War, had known each other for two hundred years by then
- 1860s went to live among Native Americans to continue Wild West life and keep away from Civil War, learn native Americans' magical witchcrafts
- might meet for some business need, trade magical items, handle bodies/crime scenes
- might meet in some local poor tavern, messy cheap place for scumbags, low life gathered, both too drunk to remember how the fight start, but already fighting each other, calling names, minor wounded but nothing seriously fatal
- (accidental unexpected) bond:
  - Once when they're both semi-drunk, both indulge in past mistakes and self-loathing, decide to kill themselves together. Joanna reused the ritual it once killed her sister, saying she improved it, it now should work as she wanted as a punishment, if one is dead, the other will die too. They did the ritual. It went wrong, now it worked the opposite way, if one is alive, the other can't die. Since both are immortal, now they just can't die unless both of them die at the same time.
  - Silas found out the first, after once having his head chopped and he's still not dead, he cried over his own head, laughing and crying, gone hysteric.
  - The promise now becomes they both can't die, just have to keep living. Two immortal beings have their eternal lives bonded, living until the end of the universe.
  - And if one of them become actually seriously decided on being suicidal, and don't care the other, they'll have to hunt down the other and try to have them both killed at the exact same instant. Or the two of them can try to kill each other at the same time. The only way to break the vow and work on the bond's loophole.

- When meet Silas again in modern time after WWII, know he changed name again, Joanna mocking, "What's your name this time, love? Haven't run out of names yet?"
