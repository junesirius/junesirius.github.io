The girl hesitated in front of the door for a while, wondering if she had gone to the wrong place. She turned her head to check again if she had pressed the wrong elevator button.

The one at the front gate told her to take the elevator to the 18th floor. It's just that the tall and neat door in front of her really doesn't look like what the girl imagined this place should be like. Everything here is more like a professor's office in a well-known university or a doctor's office in a private clinic, except that there is no golden sign at eyebrow height, with the name of the room owner written in beautiful fonts.

The girl bent her knuckles and tapped on the door three times, her heart beat a little too fast. Almost immediately, a pleasant male voice sounded in the room: "Come in please."

The girl carefully pressed the doorknob and pushed the door in, and was startled again when she caught a glimpse of the furnishings in the room and the person behind the desk. Once again she doubted if she had come to the wrong place.

It looked nothing like how she imagined Hell or the Underworld or any other concepts in the movies or books that depict as opposed to "life". There is no filthy, dark ceiling dripping with dirty water, no classic image of the Grim Reaper wearing a long black robe with a scythe on his back, no skinny crying creepy creatures kneeling and crawling on the ground, not even any decorations containing skeleton elements. The room was as clean and tidy as the impression from the outside door. There were two high bookshelves against the wall, almost reached the ceiling, densely packed with books. The girl couldn't help wondering whether she could find the complete set of Shakespeare or the Encyclopedia Britannica here, but then she quickly realized that this isn't her purpose for coming here, so she turned her gaze back to the person behind the only desk in the room.

It was a really good-looking man, almost gorgeous, with blond semi-long hair casually pinned behind his ears, which looked quite graceful and stylish, the sharp cheek outline sketched a shrewd and capable image, and the slim white clothes set off his elegant figure. The man lowered his head slightly and was busy writing something quickly on a piece of paper in front of him, black ink floating fluently. The girl wasn't sure if she had disturbed him.

"How can I help you?" The man signed a beautiful signature at the end of the paper, put the pen aside, and looked up at the girl who was still hesitant by the door.

"I'm sorry, I'm looking for the Death," the girl replied, meeting the man's dark green eyes, "I don't know if I went to the wrong place..."

She gestured awkwardly at the door and the whole office, as if to say that she might be more sure if there was a sign on the door that said DEATH.

"It is me," the man smiled and asked again, "Is there anything I can do for you?"

The girl let go of the doorknob that she had been gripping tightly before, walked into the room, and closed the door behind her.

"I want to make a contract with you," she said.

"What kind of contract?" The Death politely asked, reached out to the side drawer of the desk and took out an inventory list, and pushed it in front of the girl.

The girl saw that it was a quite detailed price list, and it was obvious that countless people before her had made deals with the Death.

"You can exchange the time in your life for wealth, or happiness, or talent, passion, dreams, freedom, anything you can think of." Death introduced, "You can also exchange the other way round, pay wealth for more time in the life, or use any other things in your life that you own and can offer. You can also exchange your life for other people's, or vice versa use other's for your own..."

"That's not what I want." The girl interrupted his chatter. "I want to sign a contract, not to make a deal."

"Tell me." The Death looked at the girl with greater interest now.

"I want to sign a one-year contract. When the one-year period expires, you will come take me with you." The girl said, every word spoke very clearly.

The Death was a little puzzled, and he pulled out the girl's file from the bookshelf behind him and checked: "But you still have a lot more time beyond this limit, why...?"

"I don't want to explain," the girl simply replied, "I just want to know, can such a contract be made?"

"Of course," The Death said, looking at the girl's lowered eyes, he felt that he might had guessed a little bit, so he just shrugged and didn't ask further, "but you have really think it through?"

"Yes." The girl replied firmly and clearly.

The Death quickly wrote down the content of the contract on a piece of white paper, and the validity period will extend from now to one year later. The girl wrote her name at the end of the paper, and the Death signed another flying signature under her name, the contract is considered effective.

The girl thanked him, and when she turned to leave the room, she smiled and said "see you next year." Her steps were much lighter than when she came here.

The Death looked at the back of the girl, and then at the neat name on the contract in front of him, and he sighed softly. People like this girl are not uncommon, the amount of such people was even increasing in recent years. Compared with those who lined up next door to submit deal applications, the Death has a strong favor over people like her from the bottom of his heart. But pity that, it just seemed that they all just regarded his place as a mere bureau office. The Death shook his head, and returned to dealing with the large stack of papers at hand. The top few sheets were all applications for exchanging life for wealth, and Death habitually signed his name at the end of every document.

<br>

One day before the contract expired, the girl came again. This time, she got more familiar with the way. When she entered the gate, she even greeted the one at the gate. After entering the building, she pressed the elevator unhesitatingly to the 18th floor.

"Come in please." The Death knew it was the girl immediately when he heard the familiar knock on the door. After all, most of the other people either didn't knock on the door, or their hands trembled too much to make a clear sound. It was so rare to have someone knock three times in such a serious, calm and rhythmic manner.

The girl opened the door and came in, looking more mature than last year. She changed the bookish plaid shirt from last year, and put on a light gray knitted sweater over a black silk shirt. And The Death's office still looks the same, except perhaps for some difference in the height of the papers on the desk.

The girl greeted him.

"Here I am again," she said.

"I remember you." The Death replied, put down the pen in his hand, and leaned back on his armchair in a comfortable posture.

"Is there anything I can do to help you today?" He asked, his beautiful dark green eyes fixed on the girl, "You still have one more day in your contract, you came early."

"I know," the girl smiled into his eyes, "I want to renew the contract for another year." Then she quickly added: "If you have no objection to this."

"As long as it's within the time limit you were destined to have, there's nothing wrong with it." The Death updated the date on the previous contract, so the contract automatically added another year.

"It's just that I really want to know, why do you go to such trouble?" The Death asked curiously, "If you have to renew your contract every year, wouldn't it be the same as letting nature take its course and waiting for me to come to you?"

The girl shook her head: "It's different."

"What's the difference?"

The girl bit her lower lip and hesitated. It's not that she doesn't trust the Death, after all, there is nothing to hide in front of the Death. It's just that she had promised to herself that she would never tell anyone the reason for signing the contract with the Death, not even the Death himself.

"You have never lived, or rather, you would never die, so I don't think you can understand it," the girl said.

"Try me." said the Death.

The girl looked at that beautiful face and the eyes that were staring at her seriously, and felt unable to refuse his ask. She had a strange feeling, as if he might really had this ability to understand her, because of his strong tolerance, it seemed that all other things became insignificant in front of him, and all emotions, whether happy or painful, They will all melt into his eyes one by one.

The girl said: "Because these one-year appointments gave me a feeling of regaining control over my life, even if it was just an illusion. I no longer need to worry about the too long-term future, no longer need to be afraid of the unknown path in the far away distance. I can see a limited end now, and it is so much easier to see the beauty in this limited length, and it is easier to live."

"But the length of natural life is inherently limited." The Death retorted, "Even a one-hundred-year contract is not long enough in the eyes of many people, and this is already much longer than most people's time limit."

The girl shook her head: "It feels too long for me. Too many things can happen in a hundred years, and the same is true for ten years. It makes me too easy to panic and worry, and I can't really live the life. I actually initially wanted to make a one-day deal, sometimes I think of you when I wake up in the morning, imagine my life is only twenty-four hours long, and ask myself if I'm still going to do what I set out to do today."

"From a certain point of view, my idea is not unreasonable." The girl continued, "Every night when I fall asleep, I feel like I died in the previous day, and when I wake up the next day, I feel revived as another me with the same memory. Human life is not too different from a mayfly. But after thinking about it for some time, I noticed some things may still need to consider about impacts on more than one day, like making some effort to prepare for the next self. Besides, it can be a little too troublesome to come to your place every day, so I decided signing a one-year contract, it’s not too long, and it’s not too short.”

The girl spoke in one breath, and when she stopped, she realized that she hadn't discussed these issues with anyone in such a deep way for a long time. She usually doesn't talk much. Even with her parents, closest friends, and psychologists, she often just talks about daily life and some less difficult topics.

The Death just listened quietly, and it had been a long time since anyone had been so honest with him too. People who came here often only sought to stay in the living world for a longer while, rather than truly appreciating his work. He was slightly touched when he heard the girl say that she would think of him when she woke up every morning. People of her age don't usually think of him regularly, and more often only realize his existence when they are lying on a hospital bed or dying of old age, and at those moments, he is often in a quite close distance to them. And now, he is still so far away from the girl, but in the girl's heart, the sense of his existence seems to be so clearer than life itself, which makes him feel a little bit of a sense of accomplishment, but he is not eager to take the girl as his own conquest. Not yet. The Death is not selfish.

"I get it," he concluded, "so it's kind of like Stockholm syndrome."

"Why?" The girl was puzzled.

"Victims who have been abused for a long time and cannot escape will deliberately provoke the abuser to get the expected abuse, so that they feel in control of the pain, so that they can bear it better." The Death explained, "So this is also the way you take when you feel confused and afraid of the unknown, you take the initiative to shorten the time limit to only one year, so that you feel more in control of the life, death and way of living, so that you can live better."

The girl frowned, and the Death added: "I'm not judging. As long as you think it can help you live better, it's fine with me."

The girl was silent for a while, and then said again: "But you forgot one thing, this annual renewal does not necessarily happen. Sometimes I really yearn for you, and that desire is so strong, until one day I might not wish to continue to renew our contract, might just wait for you to come, or take the action to come to you."

The girl raised her eyes and looked straight into the eyes of the Death: "Don't you see it? I walked into your place so frequently, last year, this year, next year, every year, even every day I miss you, because I love you, I adore you. It's this feeling that makes me feel alive, like a moth to a flame, like a phoenix reborn, always approaching destruction, even if it's not always sure I'll be reborn from the ashes afterwards? It is the destruction that forges me, revives me. You are my courage to face life, my hope for the future, and my final salvation from all my pain and struggle.”

Tears dripped on the table, soaking their contract.

"Come here." The Death stood up, walked around the table to the girl, stretched out his arms to let the girl lean on his shoulder, gently wiped the tears from the girl's cheeks, and hugged her quietly.

This is a warm embrace, just like the kind that the girl longed for for a long time, she suddenly thought of the little match girl. When that poor, hungry and cold girl fell into the arms of her grandmother, it must be this warm and happy.

Sure enough, the Death can indeed understand her, the girl thought.

"You just need someone to talk to you, someone who can understand you and love you, and that person can't be me." Death said softly above her head, even his voice is exactly the kind that the girl likes the most. The girl has stopped crying, she just wholeheartedly indulged herself in the embrace of the Death, and genuinely rejoiced by it.

"I don't dare to talk about this with too many people," the girl said in a muffled voice, "because you seem to be a taboo topic in many cultures, and you are portrayed as ugly and horrible, whether it is you or the world you live in seems to be just to scare people away from you, so that the society can keep people stay in that living world for a longer time for some stability. But obviously, in my eyes, you are everything I like."

The Death sighed softly. "It's just some illusion of mine," he said. "Everyone sees me only what they want to see. People who want to stay away from me see enough fearful image to keep them away. They paint me in black cloak and hood, draw a hollow-eyed skull for the body, and draw a sharp scythe, but I don't need these at all to scare them. And you, you are obsessed with me, so you see me as everything you like, the me in your eyes has all the things you love the most from another person, this blonde hair, this face, this voice, this outfit, but it's also just because this is what you expect to see, of course it would be different from what they see. Nobody see me for who I am."

"Vengeance conquers death, love despises death, honor longs for death, sorrow goes to death, fear preempts death. These are Francis Bacon's exact words." The Death asked the girl, "So, which one is you?"

The girl silently chewed on the words of the Death, still clinging to his hug. Even if she knows this is the Death, even if she knows that everything she loves about him is because he will appear in the appearance she likes, she still yearns for his warmth, his tenderness, and his understanding. The girl feels safe in the arms of the Death, because no one can ever hurt her from here anymore, and no one can understand and love her more than the Death himself. What could be better than this?

"But I'm not the first person to love you," said the girl, "There are too many people who have loved you before me, and have left traces of being infatuated with you. These traces make them talented and remarkable and gorgeous, and make them burn the life quickly, like Van Gogh, Hemingway, Virginia Woolf, maybe Turing can also be counted as one. There will be more people who love you in the future, so you cannot stop me.”

"I indeed cannot," The Death let go of that hug, took the girl to the door, "but I also don't want to give you false desires, because I can't give back to you like other beings you can meet in the life. Go to live the life, before our contract expires, I hope not to see you sooner, and when it expires, I also hope to see you come to renew the contract on time."

The girl still wanted to say something, but when she turned around, the Death had already closed the office door.

<br>

Another year, the girl knocked on the door of the Death's office again.

"You really should put a sign outside," the girl said, "otherwise I'm always worried that I might step into a wrong room, or that it's not you I see when I open the door."

The Death laughed: "Who will visit every year like you to notice?"

Since the last time she opened her heart, the girl and the Death have obviously become more acquainted. The Death no longer just sits behind the desk and talks to the girl with a sense of alienation and business-like, instead, now he prepared two sofa chairs for them to sit and chat. They would chat together about everything happened in the past year, laughed loudly when talking about something fun, the atmosphere is so relaxed that as if it is two old friends who are casually chatting.

"Still just renew for one year?" The Death took out the contract that had been altered twice, "If you want, we can definitely sign for a longer period."

"One year is good," insisted the girl, "doesn't sound so dreadful."

"You still think life is dreadful?" The Death asked.

The girl thought about it for a while very carefully: "Yes, it's very scary, but it's not the kind of scare that people feel when they are afraid of you. After all, I'm not afraid of you."

"You should be." The Death said half-jokingly.

The girl pretended to be distressed: "Yeah, but it's all because you are so charming. How can I love you and be afraid of you at the same time?"

The Death chuckled fondly, rubbed her hair, and stopped chasing this unsolvable problem. The girl laughed too.

He grows more fond of this girl every time they met, he slowly finds that this girl is more interesting than anyone else he has met before, she is smart and brave. She's often confused and annoyed, but she's willing to think, even if it sometimes leads her down a rabbit hole. She is delicate and sensitive, and will use reason and emotion to experience life, to feel life, to touch the life with all senses, like she said, to live the life. She will be scared, will be afraid, and will also go ahead facing the things that make her feel confused and terrified.

He likes to hear her talk about her life, her strange thoughts and ideas, her emotions, her ups and downs, her hysteria, her thoughts about him when she shed tears in the middle of the night, and the words and stories she entrusted with these emotions.

The Death entered the world of life through the girl's eyes and words. For the first time, he began to experience and feel the life up close, and he felt as if he had become alive too.

"You gave my life meaning," the girl said once.

"You know what? You are the one who gave me meaning." The Death told her, but the girl shook her head slightly to say that she didn't really believe it.

<br>

The Death gradually fell in love. When the girl leaves him, he can't stop begins to miss her, especially when she thinks of him too, and the shared bond makes the thoughts stronger for them both.

The girl's file was spread out in front of the Death again, and he stared at the girl's photo and the number next to the name that represents the limit of her life. He warned himself not to do stupid things, the girl still has a lot of time, even if she really desires him, even if the girl will definitely run towards him without hesitation when he makes such a request, but he can't do this. He shouldn't. He pressed his hands hard on his temples, trying to suppress the churning emotion. For the first time he realized, the emotions that should have been exclusive to human also took possession of him now.

The Death failed to restrain himself in the end, he sneaked out of the office and walked onto the streets of the living world.

The girl was walking on the road when she suddenly saw a familiar figure in the crowd. She froze for a moment, ran towards him, and the Death also saw her, and then realized in an instant how big a mistake he had made. The brakes of the car stopped in front of the girl, and the girl's body rose into the air.

The Death hurriedly returned to his office, not daring to wander any longer.

The girl walked in almost immediately following his footsteps.

"Is it really you that I saw on the road?" the girl asked him.

The Death avoided her eyes and whispered, like a child who broke his grandmother's favourite vase, "Yes."

"So it's my time now? I'm not complaining, it's just that I still have a few things I haven't finished," the girl said, "but I can come when I'm done."

The Death couldn't tell whether the girl's voice was more joy or anxiety.

"No, no, it was all a mistake, my mistake." The Death said hastily, "You still have time, you can do whatever you want until you want to renew the contract. This time it's my fault."

"I don't understand, then why did I see you on the street? I thought that most stories would say that when you see the Death, it means your time is up..." The girl was quite puzzled.

The Death smiled wryly: "Probably there is never any story about the Death found himself caught in human feelings, perhaps the only exception is the one named Joe Black played by Brad Pitt, and I am the second."

"You mean..." There was an unbelievable light in the girl's eyes.

"Yeah." The Death admitted, still avoiding her eyes in a panic, feeling his cheeks getting hot. This is really a very unprofessional thing.

"It's nothing bad." The girl stepped forward and hugged the Death in a very intimate gesture, trying to kiss him, but he managed to dodge it.

"No, it's not fair to you." The Death hugged the girl back, and put an index finger on the girl's lips to stop her from making any more attempts to kiss him.

"I've loved you for so many years, and it shouldn't be surprising that I would really expect a kiss," said the girl, "but to get your love, it's really unexpected."

"I can't say," murmured the Death, "I thought I wouldn't  have that kind of feeling, or maybe it was just because I was attracted by your vitality? 'Death fell in love with life', how Shakespeare the sentence is."

"Very Shakespeare indeed," agreed the girl, "so when will you give me a kiss, like the one in Romeo and Juliet."

"When the time is right." The Death promised, "I promise I will, and when that time comes, I will personally come and give a solemn kiss."

"When is that then? I'm afraid I won't be able to wait any longer and just break into this room," the girl said.

"Be patient, my girl," the Death caressed the girl's back lovingly, "I'm right here, don't worry about my leaving without saying goodbye. I can only tell you that it will be after next year, and when you come to ask next year, I would give the same answer."

<br>

Year after year, the girl grew older. She showed the Death her first wrinkle, and left her first silver hair on the Death's desk. The Death just quietly listened to her talking about the moments worth noting in those passing years, and didn't tell her that those marks were originally carved for her by himself. But he believed she knew.

"I am getting closer to you," said the girl who is old now to the Death, "but you are not affected by time at all."

The Death is still her favorite look. His half-length blond hair is still scattered around his ears, and the tail of his hair bends in a delicate arc around his neck. His high nose bridge, deep eyebrows and graceful jawline are still as graceful as a Greek sculpture.

"This is the meaning of death," the Death answered her, bending down to hug her in the wheelchair, "death freezes time."

"Can I get that kiss you promised now?" The girl still remembered all those conversations between them, even though time has also left impacts on her mind and memory.

"Are you ready?" The Death took her hand, the same way he asked her if she really thought it through about the contract when they first met.

"I thought it was up to you," she said, her voice was also old and hoarse, but through those eyes the Death could still see the girl when she stepped into his office for the first time.

"You know it's not a thing that happens to you alone, right?" The Death didn't answer directly, "I mean, it's more of a thing that happens to people around you, it's them who will have to face the parting of a loved one, not you. So I hope you had a good farewell."

"I have said goodbye," the girl smiled, as if trying to comfort the Death in reverse, "and all the thanks and apologies and telling them not to miss me too much. For those who love me and will be sad and miss too much, I told them that they can only miss me for five minutes a day, and I want to really own that five minutes that belong to me. For the rest twenty-three hours and fifty-five minutes in the day, I hope they can live the life well."

"Now, kiss me." The girl looked into the eyes of the Death, and said almost in a commanding tone.

The Death finally kissed her. After a lifetime of inseparable entanglements, the kiss that had been written in the script of fate finally fell.

"I love you," said the girl, tear rolling down with joy, "and now, at last, I become you."

"Thank you for the life you give me," replied the Death, hugging her tight.

<br>

In the living world, a small white daisy quietly blossomed, in front of a tombstone that reads "Love of the Death."
