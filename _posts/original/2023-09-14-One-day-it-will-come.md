Everyday you howl "I can't take this any longer," everyday you keep silent and keep going. You cried, you crawled, you growled, you punched on the wall, you kicked stones. And everyday you ask yourself: "Is this really the farthest you can go? Is this exact day, this exact minute, you can't take any more?" And you answer, "No." There is always another minute to endure, another day to bear with. Next minute, next hour, next day, you know there is a limit, but the limit is in the next time. Not now, not here. Now you stand up, now you bear with all the pain and suffering, now you keep going. And one day, one of these goddamn fucking painful days, this will end, and you know it will, you know you will outlive this, and you know you are strong and powerful and brilliant, and you know one day you will be out of this prison and misery, and you will see a beautiful and amazing day. Because you know that's what you deserve, and you know it will come, in time. Free and beautiful and happy. You know it.
