I have never thought a summer vacation can be so tired.

Busy like a spinning-top,

being tied tightly to the clock;

feel confused about life, 

it's vast and hazy in the distance.

<br>

When I'm extremely busy and tired,

I tend to doubt myself, and the life.

What's the point of pushing myself so hard?

Why would I spend so much time on physics?

Am I truly interested in what I am doing, or just think I should be?

What is the thing I really, desperately want?

Will the things I am doing now bring me to where I want to go?

The problem is, I really fear that I would forget my childlike dream, from inside, or by the outside force.

<br>

Make sure every step is towards the right direction isn't necessarily means going the right way, is it?

<br>

I have a feeling that I am still suppressing my desire, every now and then.

I tend to do what I'm supposed to do, rather than what I'd like to do, which makes me feeling caged again and again.

It reminds me of a sentence from one of my friends last year before graduation: 

'You are being caged, 

for your feathers are too bright.'

I love this sentence so deeply, which gives me great comfort.

I often imagine myself to be a caged bird or a trapped beast,

looking for freedom, 

hitting the invisible barrier around me. 

I feel I am and will continue to be forced to go the way which has long been designed, to make sure I could have a comfortable and easy life, no matter I enjoy it or not.

I tried to get rid of these constraints, but I can't stop wondering whether it's the right thing to do.

<br>

I seems to find out the root of my problems now.

I have said that I'm trying to do my best, in everything.

Now I realize that "everything", doesn't include myself.

I tried to be the best daughter, 

so I obeyed parents' thoughts though sometimes it's really hurting;

I tried to be the best student, 

though sometimes mountainous tasks nearly overwhelmed me;

I tried to be the best friends,

though sometimes I really, really want to lost temper and say something unpleasant, but I would always control my temper at the last minute in case I'll regret, because friendship actually means a lot to me, for I am a person who will easily feel awfully lonely.

I don't even dare to show my sadness too clearly in front of people, for fear that people would keep away from me, from the negative energy field.

So all these lead to one consequence - I have to stand all the confusion, unpleasantness and bitterness by myself.

I am, or perhaps just pretend to be, nice and kind to everyone, but utterly cruel to myself.

I don't know what's wrong with me, trying to make everyone else satisfied, but can never truly make myself cheerful. 

I pretended for too long, until I completely lose myself now.

<br>

Where is my true self?

I think the day I find the answer is the day I get the liberation.

<br>

Best wishes,

to me,

to you, 

and to the whole world.
