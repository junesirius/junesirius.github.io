Baby is home now.

It still feels so unreal. I have a car now. I feel dizzy. It doesn't sound real. It sounds... far away. Sounds like a future, sounds like "something I would do when I grow up", but not now, not the now-me. That feeling of "I'm aged enough" but not "adult" enough comes back, conflicting, tearing, centering around Baby.

But this is not about me, it's about Baby. And Baby has been awesome. She's beautiful, she's such a sense of security. She takes care of me, though I would try my best to take care of her, but still I feel she's looking out for me so much better than I could do to her.

Haven't really had a full night sleep for three weeks now, four hours a night on average, and adrenaline and caffeine have been the oil that keep me running. And now, now with Baby safely with me at home, finally I can get back to the sleep I need.

The last unfinished checkbox in 2024, the first checked box in 2025. This new year already starts big. This year is a big different year, I know it will be. And Baby is going to be there with me the whole time.

Like I said with the friends, it's like starting a new relationship, or adopting a new pet, or a new kid. Something new and emotional and big. And I'm dizzily happy.

Well, if I'm perfectly honest, I wasn't happy until I finally sit down with the keys in my pocket, remembering Baby faithfully sitting downstairs guarding me. I wasn't happy thinking about someone else might take her from me, wasn't happy with all the tricky salesperson to handle, wasn't happy thinking about all the unfamiliar things I might need to handle down the road. But they're all buried for now, for a second.

For this moment, I'm allowing myself to breathe in with Baby. Thinking about her, loving her, appreciating her in my life. Like Dad said, "what's mine is mine." So no need to rush or stress out, let the universe guide, if she's destined to belong to me, then that's it. She will come home with me one way or another. And they're right, she did.

I stressed out the whole process, holding my breath, feeling my brain muddy and crumbled -- though this is mostly due to the four hour sleep and coffee in the morning. I stressed out about every single signature I have to sign, every single piece of documents put in front me, every new person I need to meet and shake hands and I have no idea what they do or what they want. I stressed out about Baby lying to me, maybe she's not as beautiful and trustworthy as she appeared to be -- I do now, or there is no way of starting a new relationship without trust, isn't it? And the cash part, handing over all the money -- well, compared with other things, this might be the easiest, like Professor said, money is just number, cash is just paper, gold is just some metal. Some symbol, some form for trade, nothing more different than Neanderthals exchanging food with beautiful small rocks. And now my number of rocks reduced, but I have my beautiful Baby with me. Every thread of sweat is worth it.

My palms were all sticky on the way home. Sweat made Baby's wheel slippery. But I did it anyway. It gets easier real fast. At least I don't stare at the dashboard for the speed or the mirror to check if I'm in the lane that often anymore. Baby is integrating with me, becoming part of me, an extension of me. I love being her.

I used to have fantasies about what I'd do if I have a car, now with Baby, the dreams become so reachable. I'm already searching inflatable seat mattress, road trip food heater, road trip freezer, emergency tool kit, hiking tool kit, wild drink straw, emergency survival kit, US interstate map... I have to remind myself to move them into wish list from shopping cart to control the impulsion. The wild, the land, the world is waiting for me on the wheels. It's freedom.

It's unthinkable freedom.

The world opens the curtain in front me.

The show begins.

Though, knowing my own habit of imagination and execution, the competition between impulsion and anxiety, I don't know how much of the fantasies would come true. We'll have to see.

The road trip toolkits, the probably-maybe-likely the unrealistic thoughts about how I can prepare the food for the road on Friday night, get on the road on Saturday morning, drive somewhere for the day, have the dinner and spend the night in the car, drive and see some more on Sunday morning, and come back home on Sunday night, making the two-day weekends a long distance trip. Even two days seem like so much more fun and can be a real vacation. I'm still pretty sure it's going to be more of a dream than reality, but hey one can dream.

The idealizations are so closely tied with Supernatural that they are practically my thinking experiment of how the boys can have an easier and more comfortable life on the wheels. With the correct tools, they can have a moving three-star instead of crashing in motels every so often.

Can safely say Dean Winchester is the one that makes Baby possible for me. The motivation, the devotion, and all those fanfic stories about the life on the road with his Baby impala. Wouldn't have picked the model without impala, wouldn't have (finally) made the decision to make the move, wouldn't have the courage or devotion to take the big step. It's terrifying, but Dean has always been there, and impala has always been there for him. He gets his, I get mine, seems fair.

Learning everything about the car is exhausting, learning about all the tiny little things in the purchase process is even more tiring, but knowing all these things might one day end up in one of the stories with Dean and Cas purchasing a car together makes the whole process so much easier. The power of shipping can never be underestimated. Knowing Dean is as professional about the cars as a real mechanic, learning the mechanicals is so very motivational.

Been thinking about giving Baby some more identities, naming her something else, giving her a new plate, something, designs or stickers, anything. But right now still indecisive enough that Baby remains an innocent blank paper -- not counting the demon-banishing sigil in the truck already, learned from Dean too, the devil-trapping necklace could keep the evil out, worth putting in there anyway.

Thinking about giving Baby a new plate with the specific letters and numbers: "4CAS918", all the important dates to remember Cas by -- only because knowing too well Dean's plates "KAZ 2Y5" and "CNK 80Q3" would have been long gone and undoubtedly auctioned to some crazy high price. But for Cas, these might (hopefully) still be available, and not too pricey. Something to do later.

And Baby's name, thinking about something end with an "a", maybe something close to her birth make too but not necessarily. Landed on "Veta" for a day or two, derived from Mavuika, the Pyro Archon, with her flaming hair and her coolest motorcycle, it seemed fit briefly and then it felt not good enough. Thinking about "Flame" and "Falcon" for another day or two, still doesn't like the sound of them. Not catchy or not cool enough, just... doesn't feel like it's Baby. So right now she might have to stay with me calling her "Baby" for a bit until a better one comes, or until she gives me a hint in a dream. We'll know.

There have been so many friends helping me taking Baby home, I don't think I'll ever be able to do any of it without them. The friend shopping around with me, taking look at half a dozen of dealership places, the friends being with me the whole time through the tough paperwork, the moral supports and the physical supports. I would never stop feeling so blessed and appreciated knowing there are people looking out for me. "Friend" can mean so much more than any other terms that people used to believe are more superior, like lover. I'm just feeling extremely lucky. I know I'm not a good friend, not good enough in my own standard anyway, but how lucky I am that I've always been able to find the coolest, kindest, the best friends I have no idea. They're officially Baby's godfather and godmothers.

Baby, my baby, my burning flame, my girl. It's you and me and the whole world now. I even want to sing a little "Carry on my wayward son". Let the fun begin.
