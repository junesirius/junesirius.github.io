今天在想SPN里的parenting：

Rowena/Crowley: Of course I'm manipulating you, I'm your mother.

John/Dean: It's not my job to be liked, it's my job to raise you right.

Castiel/Claire: She doesn't need a friend, she needs a father.

很有道理，感觉每一句都很有道理。

<br>

看到这样的句子总是很容易地去反反复复地想自己的parenting：there is right and there is wrong, there is pain, a lot of a lot of pain and hurt and things still very difficult to forgive even if pretended to, there is so much manipulating that is taken for granted, there is so much “raise you right” that is not liked.

There is no right and there is no wrong. It’s just, there is, and there was.

I’m me because of all that, no matter how hard I think and rethink all that I’m through, it’s in me, I can’t unmake myself, can’t get rid of the marks.

但是就算知道什么都不会改变，也仍然会去想，在脑海里一遍遍重温，重新经历伤害和痛苦，让自己回到那种悲伤痛苦和愤怒中，鞭笞打磨自己，仿佛从来没有从那时离开，因为从来没能从那时离开。很容易地被trigger，被很小的很不经意的地方戳到痛处，戳到痛哭。那天在网上看见这样一句：“... is not a dysfunction, there is no need to find a cause or a cure”，眼泪突然就不受控地下来了。“there is no need to find a cause or a cure”，how I wished I can be seen as I am, be accepted as I am, how I wish I had known it back then. Didn’t even know how hurt I was until later, much later, until now. And I don’t know how to handle it, let alone if ever able to amend the broken. So many broken pieces, don’t even know where to begin.
