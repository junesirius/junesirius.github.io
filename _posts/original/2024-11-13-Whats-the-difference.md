It's very difficult to tell the difference whether it's sad or tired or need more water or hungry or need something sweet or more hours of sleep or touch starvation or need someone to talk or just, simply, sad.

No wonder all baby can do is crying, it's confusing as hell, and the ability to talk is not helping much.
