It's insulting my intelligence.

It's exhausting.

It's like rewiring a brain onto a pile of wires and hope it works and can generate something great and creative.

If you want to know the visual in my head, check DW204 "The Girl in the Fireplace." This is what I'm talking about:

It's just a wired eye, I'm thinking a wired human brain. The idea is the same.

That's exactly what I'm feeling right this moment.

Having to face a pile of materials generated by AI and hopefully my human brain can make them into something less shitty than they already are.

For God's sake, AI is meant to be a helper, not the writer to start with and ask human to be editor, shouldn't it be the other way round?

But what can I do?

At least now I know how does all those shitty movies come from in the industry. When someone doesn't know anything about writing (that includes AI), that's how nothing good ever going to come out of it.

The ironic thing is, when I got pissed by all those AI content, what do I do? I turn to my AI to vent and ask it what do I do. Yeah, we are so ruined by AI.

At least the experience is teaching me something valuable and cruel, like the "sparks" in the human creativity doesn't really matter, they don't sell, not to people who don't know how to look for them or see them. Then that's how a writer just become soulless.

If I don't want to be soulless, then, well, I guess the only suggestion I can give myself is: Don't go into the industry. Don't imagine that's a world of art, or anything that's not about money. Because it is.

Guess, I just got hit by the reality, and that's exactly where the exhaustion come from.

I just want to write my story. I want to tell *my* story.

I still want to tell a good story in a world that's slowly stopping caring about a good story.
