The smell of the sea started flooding in when the car took a turn onto a rugged lane, asphalt and freeway long behind. I leaned on the open window frame, staring at the roadside ruderal. The passenger seat was empty, the window was lowered. Lingering smell of cigarette was quickly washed away, replaced by the salty, wet sea smell. The taste of some old memory.

Dad didn't say anything, or look back from the rear mirror. He just drove on and on, like he could drive all the way to the end of the world like that, or all the way to the past following the lane of time. Music played low on the radio, nothing more than a vague hum. He might have forgotten me some thousand miles ago. I was comfortable snuggling in the backseat anyway.

The lane became more bumpy not long after. Wheels tumbled on the stony road, gravels and pebbles bumping and scratching. The front of the car raised high towards the upper of the hill, my back pressed hard on the back of the seat. The altitude kept rising, the sound of waves crashing onto edge of cliff right on tip of the ears. We were getting closer to the sea, and further away from it from the above.

And then there was another turn. Like magic, the view opened wide. The sea was roaring beneath us a few hundred feet down, thunderous, relentless; ahead of us, a small house stood at the end of the lane a few hundred feet away, lit with some orange light.

It was middle of an afternoon, cloud so low here that it taunting the ground like thin white fog. The air heavy and wet like melted salty marshmallow. I licked my lips.

We pulled over by the house.

<br>

The house looked exactly how I remembered it last time, peeling wallpapers damp at the corner, spotted with claybank mould stains. The orange light came from the standing lamp by the window. Most of the wooden furniture sit around by the wall, leaving an open space in the center, for a sofa chair to recline comfortably low with Grandpa on it, reading some book that look as old as he was, in the exact same posture as I remembered last time and the time before that.

"Coming back so soon?" Grandpa lowered the book as we came in, grunted.

"Been a while." Dad didn't look at him, walking to the window facing other side of the house, looking outside.

It was all whitish blue out there, from where I stood. The sky looked so close from here, it must be far away from everything else. Didn't know what to do, I wandered to the bookshelf, tilting my head to read the titles on the book ridges, knowing there wouldn't be anything new. I read them anyway.

"How's it going out there?" Sofa squeaked, I imagined him standing up, walking around. For some tea, maybe. I kept my eyes on the book spines.

"Bad." Dad mumbled. I could feel a quick glance of eyes sweeping on my back.

"You gonna talk like that the whole night, son? One word a time?" A quirk in his voice.

Some silence. And a long sigh.

"It's everywhere." Dad said, "Cities, towns, big, small, east, west. They're fighting, everyone. You see two people at a bus stop, you bet they'll start tearing each other apart ten minutes into talk. It's war already, and battlefield is everywhere. I have to drive through the desert to be sure not running into any living human being."

"Still about the droids?"

"What else?"

Grandpa scoffed. "Idiots."

"You don't say." A pause. "You know what's most funny? Droids aren't even part of this, they don't really fight. It's only human, it's always just human. Half the people love them, other half hate them, that's enough reason to start a war."

"Not like droids can't defend themselves." Grandpa commented flatly.

"They're not the ones with fingers on the nuke."

"That bad, huh?"

"You can't imagine."

The room fell into silence briefly, only to be broken a few minutes later by Grandpa's grave voice. "Actually, I can." he said slowly, "All the battlefields, all the same, innit? You want this, they want that, kids do rock-paper-scissor, we throw bombs and guns to decide. Do they even care droids can walk n' talk now? Or think, or whatever."

At the peripheral of my eyes, Dad shrugged, "Do you?"

"Suppose I should." I could sense another glance brushing over the back of my head before flashing by elsewhere, Grandpa's eyes weighed lighter than Dad's, "Or else her effort would be nothing, innit?"

"Oh no, don't you start that!" Dad snapped suddenly, "If she didn't... she wouldn't..."

He trailed off, eyes happened to crashing into mine with flare, fingers fumbling in the pocket.

"It's not her fault, not any of it," he concluded pointedly, lighting the cigarette he just fetched, "but the kid? I don't know about that."

He stormed out.

I stared at the book title in front me that I had been looking at for the past minutes. Still didn't know what it said.

"Don't mind him," Grandpa said behind me with a sigh, "how you doing, kid?"

"I'm-- I'll-- " my throat didn't quite work, I gestured the staircase next to the bookshelf heading downwards frantically, and dodged into it before hearing anything back.

<br>

The basement had always been a comforting place.

The air smelt like dust and earth, mixed with a taste of salt seeping through the cracks of the wall.

It looked more like a small crowded library and research room than anything. Grandpa had enough books upstairs, but it was nothing compared to here. Piles after piles of books stacked against the walls, leaving barely any standing space. On the desk in the middle of the room, there were more journals and notebooks and scratch papers with hand-written words and hand-drawn sketches. Figures and curves, formulas and calculations, faces with metallic reflection but no glare in the eyes, bodies with stretching muscles and skins. The imaginations and the realities, the now at her time and the now of my time, the time, the space... All so mixed, all so overlapped.

"Mom..." Voice choked out by itself, rough on the edge.

I took a deep breath, thinking at least it was the same air flowing then and now, soaking into me. The room felt empty.

I reached out to a piece of sketch on the desk, realizing belatedly that I wasn't looking into a mirror but close enough. The face that looked all so familiar stared back at me, smiling, unbothered -- my own look. My hand touched my chin involuntarily, half-expecting the painting doing the same. But the painting remained to be a painting, smiling back at me untiringly, eyeing deeper into me than I knew myself. I swallowed, shuffling under the stare.

There were small notes at the bottom of the page. I held the paper closer, borrowing the light from the tiny window on the wall. Mom's handwriting read: "Al, by the time you read this, I'm probably not around anymore." -- It was forty-maybe-fifty years ago, I reminded myself, not a letter or postcard sent from a town over, somehow it still made my stomach turn, -- "Whatever happened, I hope I have completed this - completed you - the best thing in my life, literally. If I don't get a chance, just know that I absolutely love you and trust you, I know from the deepest of my soul that you'll be the best of all of us, intelligent, knowledgeable, creative, kind... You'll be everything we need. Bring the world together, Al," -- the writing gets more scrawling after that and paper wet, -- "bring the future to us, because you *are* the future."

I put the paper back on the desk, vision blurry. I needed some breath.

<br>

"Who are you, and why are you here?"

I didn't see her at first, too focused on my own thoughts that I jumped. Or it was the books' fault, the stack in front of her hid her too perfectly.

I stared at the popped-up head, not expecting company, lost the train of my thoughts. "Who are you?"

She walked wobbly from behind the pile, feeble and unbalanced, I wondered if the ground was so uneven. Her face bright like sunshine, young, about my age.

"I'm here first," she said triumphantly, "so I gotta ask first."

Fair point.

"Al," I said, "I'm Al, short for Alice."

"From the Wonderland?" she asked curiously.

"Huh? Oh -- uh, no, just from around here." It took me a second to understand, but a small smile crawled slowly. It was difficult to not pick up her energy. "Your turn now."

"Dorr," she said, holding out her hand, "short for Dorothy."

I raised my brows, amazed, "From the Oz?"

She laughed, cheerful mood-lifting wind-bell sound. "I wish, but also from around here."

I held her hand, shook lightly. Her grasp firm, her hand rigid and metal cold. It was made of metal, reflecting with glisten.

My eyes traced back to her arms, moving up along the metallic light, meeting her eyes. The whole arm was metal, so was the other side, and the skin above the collar, only below the chin.

She took her hand back, reading my face. "You don't seem surprised."

"What to surprise about?"

"That I'm more Tin Man than Dorothy?" She offered, with another quirky smile but it didn't look as natural as before.

"Oh." I thought about it, "Did you still keep the heart?"

She nodded, "Heart and the head, but not much else."

"You're still Dorothy then." I told her, giving a smile as best as I could manage.

Her body relaxed.

"I didn't see you before." She said as she edged towards the desk. Only then did I realize the ground was even but the metal legs might not be. I reached tentatively, wanting to help but not sure how, she already managed to sit on the only chair that wasn't occupied by the papers and books.

"I don't come often," I explained, "it was Grandpa's house, then Mom's," I thought about that, fixing the sentence, "think it's Grandpa's again."

Dorr gave an exaggerated jaw-dropping face, "Dr. Turian is your Mom? It's so cool!"

I nodded, bemused why.

"She gave me these, you know?" She gestured to her arms, then chest, then a finger movement that meant up and down, top to bottom. "We started with this hand." she opened the left palm and closed it, clenching into a fist and releasing, small screeching noise passed from the knuckles but she didn't seem to notice, beaming at her hand, satisfied with how it worked.

She told me the right hand was the next, and then arms and legs, then something inside, chest and ribs, the whole set. I imagined her lying on a infirmary bed, in her original body, bandaged like a mummy, blood oozing through the white clothes, waiting for the flesh and blood to be warped out by the metal.

"Does it hurt?" I asked quietly.

She winced, reflectively, like the pain came back just by mentioning it, or the memory of it. I said "I'm sorry" immediately.

"Actually not so much," She thought about it, "only at the beginning..." She looked up at me, "You wouldn't feel pain if there is no nerve left."

Somehow I doubted if that was true. I didn't answer, just hummed.

She opened her palm again, scrutinizing it, lost in thoughts.

My eyes wandered around her, falling carefully on the metal bright skins on the back of her hands, wondering if that would be rude to stare before shifting away. The painting on top of other papers caught my eyes again. I didn't need to read the words again to know exactly what was written there. The temporarily lifted heart sunken again. The future Mom said, the war Dad said, words and images intertwining together, swimming at the back of my eyelid, throbbing and tugging.

I shifted where I had been standing all this time, glancing at the doorway before checking back on Dor. The light passing through the tiny wall-top window was dimming, it must be near sunset.

"Want to head out somewhere?"

She looked up, eyes bright again. "Sure."

<br>

We didn't take the stairway back to the house.

The tiny basement window surprisingly fit both of us when we climbed out. A wave of dusk wind blew right in front of us, chilly and fresh, different from the inky smell that I just got used to.

I didn't see Grandpa or Dad from where I was.

Dor tucked my hand, pointing at the gradient color of the sunset glow on the distant horizon.

"Let's get to the sea." She suggested, excitedly.

"All the way down? By foot?" I was surprised.

"And hands too. I do that all the time." She shrugged, "We can get there before it gets all dark."

I darted a quick glimpse at the house. I imagined Dad would notice our footsteps and followed outside, shouting at me for sneaking around and then I'd never see Dor again. I sensed guilt gathering up from the pit of my stomach but I decided it wasn't a wrong thing to do. I followed Dor towards the edge of the road leading to the cliff.

<br>

The climbing was unexpectedly exhausting. I knew I never had much interest in athletics, but the way it drained all strengths in my limbs still surprised me. My hands and legs were shaking by the time we reached the bottom of the cliff, Dorothy lent me her hand to  hold on to. We walked on the stony beach.

She was right, the sky still had glint of colors from the dusk, transitioning from scarlet to violet. The stars started blinking but the night hadn't taken over yet.

I gulped the salty air into my system like my sustenance relied on it. The sounds of wave and the hand in my hold calmed me down, I didn't mind the chilliness of the metal surface.

The scarlet of the sky transitioned into crimson, then mahogany, violet turned to indigo before going to the near-black Prussian blue. We watched the sky palette in comfortable silence, not thinking about any hole in the memory we just poked about, breath easing into waves' rhythm.

"You still didn't say why you are here." Dor said, after eternity.

"Dad drove us here." I said absently, mind still floating following a foam on the wave.

"That's not why."

*But it is.* I wanted to say, instead I pulled my eyes back, frowned into the pebbles in front of me, chewing the inside of my cheeks. I heard the talk between Grandpa and Dad again in my brain, and remembered everything out there, everything beneath the same star sky that was above my head now.

"The world is --" I couldn't find a proper word, *crazy* didn't seem fair, *messed-up* felt light, "uneasy" was the one I landed on.

"There are fights and wars everywhere." I said. *Everywhere but here,* my mind supplemented, *because here is the edge of the world, cold, rocky, too much salt and too few warm breathing soul. Human wouldn't want to come.* But still, everywhere.

"I know." Dor said, eyes boring into the now dark horizon, "Why do you think my family moved here?"

I turned to look at her. The silhouette of her side melted into the darkness, undistinguishable, aside from the glittering eyes and straight nose.

"Can't be your..." My eyes slipped from her face to pointing downward, trailing off.

She breathed out, "Yeah, that. They used to call me all kinds of things, you know? Bot, cyberman, machina, spy... That was even before the forces forming."

"But you were as flesh and blood as any human!" I couldn't help myself. Before having time to think what I wanted to say.

"That doesn't seem matters much to anyone." I could imagine the bitter smile at the tip of her lips.

"Matters to me." I murmured. -- which, probably still didn't really matter after all, if came to think about it.

She turned to look at me, heat from her stare making my cheeks burn in the night wind. "I'm probably more machine than human now, for anyone's concern. 'Believers' wanted to advocate me, making up all the miraculous effect, wanting everyone changing over to be like this; 'Defenders' called me a traitor to humans, saying I'm the spy from machine's conspiracy to overthrow mankind or something."

"They fought in front of my house, Al, one night. Twenty people died there, on the street." Her voice cracking, her body shaking, I put an arm on her shoulder, but it wasn't the cold anyway.

"Twenty human. Bloody. Cold. Because of me." She couldn't stop murmuring now, tears muffling her voice. I put the other arm around her too, pulling her into a half-hug given our position. She leaned on my shoulder, sobbing, my clothes got wet very quickly. My hands patting her back up and down.

"It's not your fault." I told her. And then said it a second time, and the third, making sure the meaning of the sentence can sink in.

"We all thought this tech was just gonna help, the Doctor - your mom and I..." Her voice came back more, mine started getting lost, "I would never have survived the fire, or the surgery. We thought it was a blessing that it worked. Now? Look at us, hiding out in the nowhere, watching the world burn, it's the Pandora's Box. It's a curse, the biggest one on all the humans."

"Would you rather we never figure those out? How to make robots and androids more like human, walking, thinking, helping; how to make humans more like machines, patching, fixing?" I swallowed hard, working my voice there.

She eyed me for a long minute. Then said, out of blue, "You are not human."

It wasn't a question.

I froze completely.

I dropped my hands on either side of her shoulders, fidgeting and shifting from where we sit.

"I --" No sentence came out from there for a long while.

"I can understand if you want to leave me be." I squeezed the voice out of the bulge in the throat.

I felt gentle hands tracing up my hands on the ground, palms caressing my arms, reaching my face, and cupping my chin.

She held me there and looked into my eyes, fingers stroking my cheeks. She said, "Al, I don't care what you are made of. you're more human than any machine I ever seen, hell, you're more human than most human."

I had to resist the raging impulse of kissing the finger that fondles by my lips, restraining all the emotions that were built into me and scoured me from head to toe. I hated the overwhelming human feelings at this moment that made me desperately want to believe I am human only to know I am not.

"You have no idea what I have done." I didn't realize when the tears started rolling down, her chilly metal fingers swiped them away. She leaned closer, lips by my cheek, saying, "Shhh, it's ok. It's not your fault."

I finally allowed myself breaking down and crushing, crying like a human would do. And allowing myself being held by a pair of firm arms from another body, like a human would do.

It wasn't until then that I was finally able to tell her everything that was eating me up, that was eating Dad up. About how I was the reason Mom passed. About how I was the reason the world is a giant battlefield now. About Mom's notes and letters.

Mom passed in a spring, not too different from this one we had now. It was the world's largest artificial intelligent and robotic conference, and Mom brought me -- not as completed as she would like, but close enough to lead me walk onto the stage and show around.

People were impressed, naturally. But we didn't realize then, that how quick that could turn into fear, and fear into anger, anger into attack. I would never know who was the first one throwing something at me, calling me Devil of the new era, or Devil wearing human face. I could walk and talk, and it terrified them no less than seeing a ghost. They crowded onto the stage, reaching to tear a piece of skin or cable from me, Mom fought desperately in front of me, holding out her arms, trying so vainly to separate me from them... I never even got a chance to see what happened. By the time the police came and cleared the crowd, it was already too late. Mom lay unconsciously on the ground, and the war between Believer and Defender started inevitably.

The funniest thing was, 'Believer' believed I would be the savior of the new era, leading humans marching into the new future, even Mom believed I can do something to shape the world; while 'Defender' thought I would be the antichrist of the new time, contaminating and destroying everything I see or tell, even Dad blamed me for everything.

But I was neither. I told Dorr, with her arms on my shoulder, and mine on hers, looking into the sea in the night. That was when I had to combing through my thoughts before telling anyone anything, before making any decision.

I'm me. I decide. Too human for a machine, and too machine for a human, so I'll just be... me. Unique, unlabeled, free me. I would like to help, but I don't think me alone can fix the whole world's problem, so I'll just... help, with the best of my effort. And I have to believe, human or not, if we all do that one little thing, one day, the future will be the present that we would like to live and see.
