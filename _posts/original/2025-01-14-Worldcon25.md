The smell of the sea started flooding in when the car took a turn onto a rugged lane. Asphalt and freeway were long behind us. I leaned on the open window frame, staring at the roadside ruderal. The passenger seat was empty, the window was lowered. Lingering smell of cigarette was quickly washed away, replaced by the salty, wet sea smell. The taste of some old memory.

Dad didn't say anything, or look back from the rear mirror. He just drove on and on, like he could drive all the way to the end of the world like that, or all the way to the past following the lane of time. Music played low on the radio, nothing more than a vague hum. He might have forgotten me some thousand miles ago. I was comfortable snuggling in the backseat anyway.

The lane became even bumpier shortly after. Wheels tumbled on the stony road, gravels and pebbles bumping and scratching. The front of the car raised high towards the upper of the hill, my back pressed hard on the back of the seat. The altitude kept rising, the sound of waves crashing onto cliff right on tip of the ears. We were getting closer to the sea, while away from it from the above.

And then there was another turn. Like magic, the view opened wide. The sea was roaring beneath us a few hundred feet down, thunderous, relentless; ahead of us, a small house stood at the end of the lane a few hundred feet away, lit with some orange light.

It was in the middle of a afternoon, cloud so low here that it covered the ground like thin white fog. The air heavy and wet like melted salty marshmallow. I licked my lips.

We pulled over by the house.

<br>

The house looked exactly how I remembered it last time, peeling wallpaper damp at the corner, spotted with claybank mould stains. The orange light came from the standing lamp by the window. Most of the wooden furniture sit around by the wall, leaving an open space in the center, for a sofa chair to recline comfortably low with Grandpa on it, reading some book that look as old as he was, in the exact same posture as I remembered last time, and the time before that.

"Coming back so soon?" Grandpa lowered the book, grunted.

"Been a while." Dad didn't look at him, walking to the window side, standing by the lamp, looking outside.

It was all whitish blue out there, from where I stood. The sky looked so close from here, it must be far away from everything else. Didn't know what to do, I wandered to the bookshelf, tilting my head to read the titles on the book ridges, knowing there wouldn't be anything new. I read them anyway.

"How's it going out there?" Sofa squeaked, I imagined him standing up, walking around. For some tea, maybe. I kept my eyes on the book spines.

"Bad." Dad mumbled. I could feel a quick glance of eyes on my back.

"You gonna talk like that the whole night, son? One word a time?" A quirk in his voice.

Some silence. And a long sigh.

"It's everywhere." Dad said, "Big city, small city, east, west. They're fighting, everyone. You see two people at a bus stop, you bet they'll start tearing each other apart ten minutes into talk. It's war already. I have to drive through the desert to be sure not running into any living human being."

"Still about the droids?"

"What else?"

Grandpa scoffed. "Idiots."

"You don't say." A pause. "You know what's most funny? Droids aren't even part of it. It's only human, it's always just human. Half the people love them, other half hate them, that's enough reason to start a war."

"Not like droids can't defend themselves." Grandpa commented.

"They're not the ones with fingers on nuke."

"That bad, huh?"

"You can't imagine."

The room fell into silence briefly, only to be broken a few minutes later by Grandpa's grave voice. "Actually, I can." he said slowly, "All the battlefields, always the same reason, innit? You want this, they want that, kids do rock-paper-scissor, we throw bombs and guns to decide. Do they even care droids can walk n' talk now? Or think, or whatever."

At the peripheral of my eyes, Dad shrugged, "Do you?"

"Suppose I should." I could feel another glance of eyes brushing over the back of my head before flashing by elsewhere. "Or else her effort would be nothing, innit?"

"Oh no, don't you start that!" Dad snapped suddenly, "If she didn't... she wouldn't..."

He trailed off, eyes happened to crashing into mine with flare, fingers fumbling in the pocket.

"It's not her fault," he concluded pointedly, lighting the cigarette, "but the kid? I don't know about that."

He stormed out.

I stared at the book title in front me that I had been looking at for the past ten minutes. Still didn't know what it said.

"Don't mind him," Grandpa said behind me with a sigh, "how you doing, kid?"

"I-- I'll-- " my throat didn't quite work, I gestured the staircase next to the bookshelf heading downwards frantically, and dodged into it before hearing anything back.

The basement had always been a comforting place.

The air smell like dust and earth, mixed with a taste of salt leaking through the cracks of the wall.

It looked more like a small crowded library and research room than anything. Grandpa had enough books upstairs, but it was nothing compared to here. Piles after piles of books stacked against the walls, leaving barely any standing space. On the desk in the middle of the room, there were more journals and notebooks and scratch papers with hand-written words and hand-drawn sketches. Figures and curves, formulas and calculations, faces with metallic reflection but no glare in the eyes, bodies with stretching muscles and skins. The imaginations and the realities, the now at her time and the now of my time, the time, the space... All so mixed, all so overlapped.

"Mom..." voice fumbled out by itself, rough on the edge.

I reached out to a piece of sketch, realizing belatedly that I wasn't looking into a mirror. The face that looked all so familiar stared back at me, smiling, unbothered. My hand touched my chin involuntarily, half-expecting the painting doing the same. But the painting remained to be a painting, smiling back at me untiringly, eyeing deeper into me than I knew myself. I swallowed, shuffling under the stare.

There were small notes at the bottom of the page. I held the paper closer. Mom's handwriting read: "El, by the time you read this, I'm probably not around. --" It was forty-maybe-fifty years ago, I reminded myself, not a letter from a different town, somehow it still made my stomach turn, "-- Whatever happened, I hope I have completed this - completed you - the best thing in my life, literally. If I don't get a chance, just know that I absolutely loved you and trusted you, I know from my soul that you'll be as intelligent as machine, as kind as human, as strong as machine, as flexible as human... Bring the world together, El--" the writing gets more scrawling after that, "-- make the future great again."

I put the painting back on the desk. I needed some breath.

"Who are you, and why are you hiding?"
