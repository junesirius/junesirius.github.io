"Look who finally decided to join us," I heard Carol's voice the moment I stepped onto the grassland.

"The man himself," Tristan mocked, then corrected himself, "sorry, the God herself."

I raised an eyebrow.

"How long it's been?" Carol turned to me lazily from the position she lay on the grass, too comfortable, like a cat under the sun. "It's almost like you only think of us, think of this place, when you lie down on the massage table." She smirked, one tip of her lips higher than the other.

They seemed genuinely grumpy today.

I fluttered, not expecting that. "That's not true," I tried to defend myself, tried to think of a time that's not true, but then felt even worse not able to think of one. I tripped over my own words.

Carol laughed, rising up from the land, coming to me. The smile warm and mischievous, the kind it'd been so easy to spot if I haven't been worried and all guilty.

"Gotcha," she laughed, dragging me into an embrace, practically hauling me closer to the sea. Not a single slightest sign of annoyance.

I widened my eyes. "You got me."

Tristan laughed too.

"We missed you, that's all." Carol said, lying down in the old spot again, shifting to find the most comfortable spot. "We're glad you come."

"Been busy lately," I said, sitting down beside her, arms wrapped around my knees, facing the sea. The sea here today is exactly like the sea out there. Quiet, calm, salty. White foam pushed by the wind, drawing layers of waves onto the beach. The water looked more green than blue. A kind of natural, deep-ocean green. The sun hanged at the edge of the horizon, warm but not too blinding, just comfortable enough to enjoy the sunbath without having to worry about any sunburnt. Out there it's probably less than an hour to the sunset, in here, it's going to stay there until we want it move.

I took a deep breath. Salty air fill my lungs -- this one isn't imaginary. Sometimes when I inhaled too deeply, feeling all those salty smell filling every inch of my lung, it'd feel like I'm like a drying fish waiting to be pickled with all the savory flavors.

"Yeah, figured as much," Carol glanced at me, tone casual. "Think you can relax a bit when you're here? You know, for an hour?"

I kept my breath the same rhythm as the sea's.

"I'm trying." I told her.

"You try to hard." Tristan commented.

I shot a glimpse at him, "Well, don't think I can do anything about that."

"Yeah, I can practically hear your brain running, like the car engine, or the CPU in your new PC." Tristan said carelessly.

"Might as well let it all out," Carol suggested. "Come on, hit me, what's in your mind? What are you thinking?"

"That I'm a little hungry today, so I might not have much time here." I examined my thought, telling her as they come. "I didn't have coffee today, so I might have an early night, that's a plus, considering having a full day tomorrow."

"How long since you have a dream you can remember?" Carol asked suddenly. Like a doctor listening to my symptoms and now she's asking the critical questions for diagnosis.

"A while," I admitted, "I think I had some in yesterday's nap, or the weekend. But nothing I can remember too clearly, not like before when I was recording them."

She shot me a concerned look, "You know what it means."

"Yeah," I looked down, picking the sand in my hands and dropping them, "my brain's exhausted, memory and everything. I'm getting dumb, you're thinking that, don't you?"

Carol crackled slightly, "I didn't say that, you did."

I faked a sigh, "That's true anyway."

She nudged me from the side lightly, "Just get some more rest, or I'd worry. I'll get dumber too if you burn out."

More guilt crept in. I totally forgot that too. But she's so right.

"What else's been keeping you up?" She asked again, probably an effort to distract me from that train of thought. And it worked.

"Writing. All those writing. All the stories I want to tell. They're draining me." I said. "They are ones I wanted to tell, but almost every time, three days in, and I'd lose my patience. They're just becoming insufferable."

They just listened to me, not commenting anything this time. When it came to stories, it got serious.

"Some stories wrote themselves, but not all of them. Even those that did, not all the time. I had to push through those rough parts, and man, some parts are so rough I have no idea if they'd work. I ran out of vocabulary every time when I reach about two thousand. Anything longer than that, I feel like I'm just using the same set of words over and over again. It's boring, it's annoying, and I just can't seem to improve." Once I started ramping out, there is no stop. Too late for them now.

"Ideas came larger than words I had, like I'm trying to build something big but my toolbox is just too small. It's exhausting."

Carol straightened her upper body, put her head on my shoulder. "It's okay." she said gently, one arm wrapped around my other shoulder. "It's okay. You're doing awesome. Take it easy. People were reading emotions not words. You could get so much emotions out from so few words, don't you? That's something so many people jealous about too."

I shrugged slightly. Figured she might be right. I didn't retort on that one.

"And the character building. I'm never really good at creating new human, I have no idea how god did that. And those lazy ways of borrowing characters others created, it's not really doing me much good." I stared at the round of orange cloud newar the sun.

"You know, I didn't realize that so vividly until quite recently," I told her. "I knew I wasn't too good at it, and I'd been okay with that. But when I saw what a friend did, just so casually piecing together a character so interesting, but something I've never come up with, a guitarist moonlighting assassin. I had to rethink those ones I did for myself, like you and Tristan. But there's just so few 'me' in those. Like I'm still walking on canes, borrowing others' ideas, nothing of my own. Like Joanna Beth, not even her name is hers own. Or her face, or her childhood, what she did for a living, how she's like. Just, nothing. She's a clone, at the best. And I felt so bad for her. She's sort of mine, but she's more Frankenstein than a real complete flesh and blood character."

"I think you did us quite well. Just saying." Tristan said carefully.

"Your name isn't yours, it comes from the book I liked. Your wings are yours, they come from the popular show. Want me to say more?" I said cynically. He fell silent. I felt even worse for shutting him up. He's just trying to help.

"Sorry," I said quickly, stealing a glance. He shrugged, but his face was hidden in shadows. I probably hurt his feelings, whether I meant it or not. I'd become an asshole when I got upset, that much I know.

"All good writers borrow something from others," Carol managed, apparently trying to lift the mood.

"Not all stealing faces and names." I pointed out.

"Have to start somewhere," she said, "don't compare to J.R.R. Tolkien when you're just starting. That's your own word, remember you just started writing in this second language for less than a year."

I was muted for a brief moment. She had a point. She had a really, really good point that I kept forgetting. I swallowed. "Right," I said. Yeah, that's a really good point to not be too harsh.

She managed a smile, "See? Feeling better now?"

"You always have the magic to achieve that, don't you?" I smiled weakly, but a smile nonetheless.

She shifted her head, turning to lean on me, but not pressing with too much weight, just a comforting one. "'Cause I do. That's why you love me."

"Look at you," I'm surprised. Since when did she grow to be so mischievous and open and having all those cute little traits I didn't know were in her?

She felt so alive, like no other characters in the worlds I built. So special. So real. Sometimes I wonder if she *is* real. And the conclusion is -- yes.

She smiled brightly, pecking a kiss on my cheek.

"Now, move your ass to have that dinner you really need and that nice long night of sleep you definitely need. I'll help you with Joanna Beth tomorrow, alright? We can invite her over a tea or something, open a potion shop for her if she wants, you can talk with her and all that. Should make it easier to feel her as she decides for herself, like the way you did for me, the freedom you give me, isn't it?"

That is such a brilliant idea. Why didn't I think of it myself?

"I'd like that," I told her.

Though, a small part of me was still wondering if I'd ever create a character more wonderous, more brilliant, more talent, more interesting, and more ready for the world to see, than her.

It pained me to think there might be one surpassing her for my love. It pained me to think if there wouldn't be one, then I'm looking at my ceiling of creation just watching her walk around.

She read my mind. "Stop beating yourself up." she snapped, demanding and all dominant. "There will be one, and you will love what you create. I don't mind. That's what it's like to be a god, to create lives, to love and be loved by her creations, or hate and hated, if they desire. Whichever way, just let them be. Invite every new life here, and we'll talk. They'll figure out their shit, you'll figure our yours. Bob's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt. Everyone go home happy. Alright?"
