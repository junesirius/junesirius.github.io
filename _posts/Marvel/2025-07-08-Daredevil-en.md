<br>

When the last dust finally settles, there is a brief, surreal moment Matt feels like everything has just returned to how it used to be -- before Fisk has ever appeared, before all the blood and wounds and tears. As if he's just graduated from law school, every day is just a casual easy day he and Foggy can sit on a doorstep, share their inside jokes, laugh into the night sky, talk about their dreams, make grand plans -- dreaming of how to make the world a better place by building Nelson & Murdock from scratch.

He'd raise his glass, clinking it against Foggy's and Karen's in Josie's. They'd laugh -- loudly, carelessly, freely, as though all the wounds and pain have finally healed -- or never been there -- buried underneath piles of old case files and newspapers, smelling of faint stale ink. The scars catch a glimpse of notice once in a while, ever so slightly, casting a glance of the past, a dream flashing by at the back of the head, forgotten when the morning comes. Becoming stories to tell over late-night drinks, memories with a distant sense of Deja Vu like a past life.

And eventually, even the dreams fade. Memories of blood no longer haunting, nightmares no longer lingering. The nights grow quiet, so do the minds.

It has been months. Their daily conversations have shifted from cleaning up the last of Fisk's dwindling crumbling leftover thugs to mostly mundane caseworks -- that's when they pick up the call. Technically, it's Foggy who picks up the call, but Matt hears everything just as clearly.

"Mrs. Nadeem?" Foggy recognizes the woman's voice, glancing at Matt reflexively. "What happened? Is everything okay?"

"I know it might seem abrupt, but I don't know who else to call." Her voice is tight, strained thin, pained but still managed to hold together. She sounds helpless, but she's not crying. She's a strong woman -- Matt remembers -- even that night when they were running for their lives, she didn't let all her fear show. Her heartbeat was frantic in despair, but her steps were steady, so were her hands, tightly shielding her kid.

"What's wrong? Is there anything we can help?" Foggy asks gently.

"It's Sami," Seema says, falling into short silence. Across the phoneline, Matt hears her swallow hard. She's trying desperately to hold herself together, pacing from one end of the room to another, embracing herself.

They wait patiently, giving her the time she needs.

She continues, "Since that day... since Ray was gone, Sami's been different. I don't know how to explain it. He's always been quiet, shy around strangers, didn't talk much -- but not like that. It's getting worse everyday. It's like, he's shutting down. He talks less and less, going almost completely muted. Sometimes he goes days without saying a word, not even to me. He locks himself in his room most of the time. I'm so worried, I don't know what to do..."

She pauses again, taking a deep breath, fighting back a sob that is coming close. Then, more composed, quieter: "I'm sorry. I know you were just his lawyers. I shouldn't be bothering you with this." She sounds like about to hang up the phone.

"No, no, it's fine," Foggy says quickly, voice all gentle and concerned, full of warmth. "We're glad you called. Really. Is there anything we can help with? Anything else you want to talk to us, about Sami?"

Seema goes on, "I think he's carrying too much, holding everything inside, things too much for a kid his age to bear, things he can't get out. It's eating him up. I've seen him punch his pillows, scribble with so much force the pencil breaks, tearing through papers. But I can't tell what he's drawing. Just lines and colors. He doesn't talk to me. He doesn't listen. It's like he'd built a wall and there is no way in or out. I tried taking him to my sister's place, hoping he'd play with other kids, but he just went to the attic, locking himself alone again..."

Matt hears a quiet drop of tear falling from her cheeks. She wipes it away with the back of her hand.

"I thought maybe... maybe he just missed his father, you know. I kept thinking it would pass, the mourning would pass, time would heal. But it's been so long, and he's not getting any better. Only worse. He's sinking deeper, drowning. I don't know what else to do. I just thought... maybe you've seen people like this before, you know, with the survivors from your cases, people trying to live after the worst happened. Maybe you'd know something that could help..." Her voice starts choking in sobs.

Foggy shifts uneasily, turning to Matt, lips opening and closing, hesitant of what to say, tongues losing the eloquecy as he'd used to in courts. Matt faces the general direction of the phone, expression solemn and quiet. Sad. No sign of answering.

Foggy tells her, "We'll come visit, if it's okay. If it could help."

"Thank you," the woman says, then a few more times. "Thank you so much."

She hangs up.

Matt is utterly quiet, deep in thoughts.

"What is it?" Foggy asks.

Matt lifts an eyebrow slightly. "What? I didn't say anything."

"You think too loud," Foggy tells him. "I know that look. That's your 'I don't like the idea but I'm too polite to tell you no' look."

Matt turns away from him, walking over to the window, facing outside.

"Foggy," he says, his voice carefully controlled, "this is a kid who lost his father. There is nothing we can say, nothing we can do, that will ever change that fact or make that easier. Becauce the truth is, as he grows up, his father is not going to come back home ever again, or take him to the park again, or walk him to school, or take him to the boxing gym --" His voice halts abruptly.

Foggy waits.

Matt turns back, walking slowly to the door, reaching for his cane leaning by the door side.

"Okay then," he says slowly. "Let's go see him."

<br>

Seema still lives in that old house. The place has been fixed inside out, the paint on the walls smells new, the broken furniture replaced. There is almost no trace of the fight that once tore through the whole place.

Seema waits for them on the porch.

"Tea or coffee?" she asks, trying to smile. But her voice sounds too tired to hold that smile, even more worn than the last time they saw her.

Foggy hesitates. "It's okay, we don't want to --"

"Coffee, please," Matt cut in quickly, nodding at the woman with his practiced warm smile.

She nods and leads them into the living room, then disappears into the kitchen.

"I thought we were just stopping by, you know, a short visit," Foggy hisses quietly, confused.

"Let her have something to do," Matt answers under his breath. "It might help her too."

Seema comes back with two cups of black coffee. "Sami's in his room," she says, gesturing toward a closed door.

Matt tilts his head in that direction, tuning in. The room feels like a normal six or seven-year-old's room, with its messy interiors -- no, that's not the right way to put it, considering it's more like just been freshly torn apart by a tornado. Matt can hear books hitting the floor, papers crunched. Sami has just knocked over the last stack of books on his shelf, leaving no empty space on the floor, before throwing himself onto the bed.

"Do you know what he's doing right now?" the mother asks carefully, voice low and tight with worry.

Matt nods briefly. "He's lying on the bed. Face down. Hitting his pillow."

Seema lets out a deep sigh, burying her face in her hands. "He does that a lot. Sometimes when the door is not locked and I get to peek inside, that's what I see too."

"Please," she asks them, facing Matt, tone quiet and pleading, "please help him."

Matt stands. "May I?" he asks, heading in the direction of Sami's room.

Seema nods behind him.

<br>

"I can't see! I can't see!!" he hears a young boy cry, screaming with pain and rage.

Nine. That's him, nine years old.

He never had a clear vision ever again after that day, but the memory of it, of that day, of that moment, is never more vivid, never sharper. He watches himself from all directions, sees himself, that boy, eyes wrapped in layers upon layers of gauze, crying out to the sky.

"Why?! WHY?!!!" he hears the boy screaming, in the middle of the nights, waking from nightmares. The night is as dark as the day, the world is the same burning fire in his view. The boy screamed until his throat burned raw, until he had no voice left.

"If God loves us, why would He take eyes away from me?!" He kicked and bit and threw everything his arms could reach and smashing them against the walls. His world was burning in anger and grief, there was fire everywhere, inside and out, swallowing him, drowning him, tearing him apart piece by piece.

"Matty, Matty, I'm here." It's his father's voice. Steady, even, yet also so strained, so pained.

His father's hands would catch his, guiding his fingers to feel, to touch the warm skin on the back of his hand, the stubble on his cheek. He tells him, "Hey, I'm right here. You can touch me. I'm here. I got you." He squeezes his hands, the fingertips, the palm, taking the boy's to his lips.

The boy calmed down slowly, falling asleep with tears still clinging to the corners of his eyes.

The days moved forward, one day at a time. But days after days.

And then, it happened again. When his father was gone.

The same helpless rage, the same sleepless nights, the same desperate screaming into nothing, answerless questions to the sky. Sometimes he thought, maybe the only way to quiet his mind, was to tire his body out in exhaustion -- so he fought, beat, caught in trouble, leaving bruises and scrapes all over, anything to dull the ache inside.

He can still see that boy, that nine-year-old screaming, terrified, confused boy, that him from the past. He watches him in his mind, regarding him from every angle, in every step of his way, as if going back inside that boy's body and soul, reliving the burn and pain in those moments. The scorching pain from the loss, the boiling rage from confusion, the anger, the desperation, the lost, the scare. The empty eye sockets, the heart. Then the whole soul. Burning every inch of his existence to ashes.

As if walking through fire.

As if walking through flames from Purgatory.

It was then. So is it now.

<br>

On the other side of the door, Matt senses the same fire, burning red inside that child, swallowing him, tearing him apart from the inside, exhausting his mind and body.

He knocks on the door three times. Quietly.

The punching inside pauses.

He knocks again.

He knows Foggy and Seema are watching him in silence behind him, frowning deep.

The footstep behind the door hesitates, but heading to the door slowly. Small ones.

"Sami," Matt says, in his most gentle voice, "It's me. Matt. We've met before."

<br>

They did meet before. Not just the night of the fight and running. The second time was at Ray Nadeem's funeral.

After the FBI finally cleaned up all the corrupted parties, they cleared the names of the wronged agents, holding a collective service for them. Special Agent Ray Nadeem's black-and-white photo stood among the others.

That day, it was raining in New York. Just like all the raining days that are most suitable for a funeral.

The air smelled of fresh earth in the graveyard.

Seema held an umbrella in one hand, the other clasping Sami's, when they buried her husband's coffin.

Matt, Foggy, and Karen stood under a tree in a farther distance, didn't carry umbrellas, didn't walk up to talk. There were no words.

Flowers were rested gentled atop the casket. Seema shook hands with unfamiliar but polite colleagues of her husband's, the boy clung to the edge of his mother's cloth, hiding behind her.

"We should go," Foggy whispered after a while, offering an arm for Matt to take. A gesture they were used to.

"I would like to stay a bit longer," Matt said, leaning on his cane. The tip of it sank into the soft earth, leaving a small dent.

Foggy gave him a long look -- undoubtedly concerned, the kind that quietly asked "are you okay" but nothing came out, only squeezed his shoulder gently. He and Karen left the graveyard early.

Matt knew the boy was watching him. Among all the men and women moving here and there, the boy fixated his gaze on him. The look had a weight of its own, a natural curiosity and a quiet attraction. Somehow, knowing that, made Matt unsettled.

He heard Sami let go of his mother's hand, his small shoes stepping on the wet earth, squelching the mud, heading his direction.

The boy stopped a few steps away. His heartbeat was faster than usual for a six-year-old, but not by much.

Matt tilted his head toward him, angling his fact behind the sunglasses to seem as if he were meeting his eyes.

"You can't see," the boy said bluntly.

"That's right," Matt answered.

"Then you can't see the grave or the coffin," the boy added.

Matt's heart clenched. "That's right," he said again.

"That's... kind of nice," the boy whispered, stepping closer.

"But I can feel it," Matt told him. "I can sense everything."

"How?" the boy raised his head, studying his face.

"Just like I can feel you're really sad right now," Matt said. His heart was squeezed so tight he could hardly breathe. But he kept his voice gentle and steady.

"How do you know?" the boy continued asking.

"And that you don't want to be here. You want to go home. You want you father to be there waiting, want him to pick you up and scratch your face with his stubble, and tell you all this was just a bad dream," Matt said, wiping his cheek. The cold rain left a trail of water there.

The boy didn't answer. He stepped right next to him, sitting down on the damp ground.

Matt sat down as well, letting the cold wetness seep through his suit, sinking into his skin.

"I don't understand," the boy said.

Matt waited.

"Dad said he did it for us. But if he really did it for us, why did he leave us?"

Matt sighed long and deep, trying hard to ignore the bleeding in his chest, forcing himself to focus instead on the boy next to him.

He told him, "You'll understand when you're older."

Just like everything he hated the adults telling him when he was a child.

<br>

"I don't understand! I don't understand!!" His fists slammed against the heavy sandbag -- without wraps or gloves, his knuckles soon bleed and broke, but he could barely feel it.

"That's because you're selfish. You want the world to spin around you, boo hoo --" an old voice said, dry and cold, too cruel. "When you grow up, when you're ready, Matty, you will understand."

"God has a plan for everyone, Matthew," another old and wise voice said, gentler. "Sometimes what we need to do is not to understand, but to follow, to observe, to listen. To find the signs, the guidance. And then, slowly, gradually, if we're lucky, if we pay close enough attention, if we discover enough guidance -- maybe we can finally understand why He arranged all of this for us."

He knelt on the floor, facing the sky, where the God would be. He prayed, he believed, he had faith. He looked for answers. Days after nights.

Since then, and until a long time after.

But he still couldn't find the answer, couldn't find any answer -- why the world is like this, why father did that, why, why, why... Some days he thought he caught a glimpse of understanding, but soon enough, there would be more questions, more confusion, more pain. More unceased fire, more pain, more burning. Always more, never less. Always a hole that would only grow deeper, wider, darker. A space that would never be filled by his father.

<br>

The boy opens the door. Not much, just a crack, barely enough for the kid to peek outside.

Matt lowers himself to match the kid's height. "Sami," he says softly, "Can I come in?"

The boy stares at him for a moment longer, not noding, not shaking his head. But after a while, he opens the door a little wider.

Matt steps in carefully, sensing the books and papers and toys on the floor, trying his best not to step on any of them. The door is shut again behind him.

Sami stands a few feet away, arms crossed, watching him.

Matt turns around, waiting.

Finally, Sami speaks, in a voice too cold for a boy his age, too controlled and constrained, "What are you doing?"

Matt doesn't answer. Instead, he reaches for the boy and flips him down onto the soft bed in a sudden move -- roughly, almost brutally.

Sami crashes onto the comforter and pillows, freezes for a second. Then launches himself forward, barreling into Matt's stomach. The two of them crash to the floor together hard. A loud bang. The boy on top of him.

Matt props himself up, but barely halfway up, Sami is already coming at him again. This time his fists rain down on him, the kid's punching his shoulder and arm, falling on him again and again.

Matt takes it. Every blow.

From outside, Foggy's voice yells, "Matt! What's happening?!"

Seema's voice is startled, "Sami! Are you okay?"

The two people inside the room are both too occupied to answer. Only muffled scuffling. Punches landing.

Eventually, the boy tires. His fists go limp. He leans forward, collapsing into Matt's chest, burying his face there. His fists loosen, instead, turning to grasp at Matt's clothes like he's the last floating plank for a drowning swimmer.

Matt wraps his arms around the kid, gently smoothing down his messy curls like a wounded little creature.

And finally -- finally -- Sami cries.

The kid trembles in his arms, shaking in sobs. Matt counts his own breath, taking them in slowly, then exhaling them out deep. The boy presses his ears to Matt's chest, his breathing evens out gradually.

In that moment, Matt senses a rare peace he hasn't felt in a long, long time.

<br>

"You were in a fighting again." When the Father found him on the open ground behind the church, he was practicing spinning his cane like it's a kind of weapon.

"Did someone go and tell?" he challenged, voice edged with defiance.

"No, because no kid would be willing to admit they got into fights with you and lost," Father Lantom sighed.

"So you have no proof or witness," he replied calmly. Too calmly, almost cold, icy.

"Matthew, I'm not looking for proof. I just want to help you," the Father said, resigned. "That fire inside you -- if you don't learn to control it, one day it's going to control you."

"I think I'm controling it just fine," he said, again in his voice too distant for someone his age. Remote and isolated.

Father Lantom sighed again. Before he turned to leave, he said, "You need something. I just wish I knew what it was."

When he was left alone on the back steps of the church, he pressed a hand against his forearm; the bruises there hurt, but not so bad to be unbearable. He still sucked in a quiet, sharp breath at the sensation.

The grown Matt stands before the child version of himself, looking down at that little stubborn, wounded creature in his memory, tending to his pain in all the desperate ways he was trying to find.

"Guess I know what it was now," he thinks.

He reaches out slowly, opening his arms to offer. The boy in his imagination lifts his head, hollowed eyes tilted toward the sun setting in the distance behind his ghosty shape, turning away and running afar.

Matt keeps his posture, waiting.

<br>

When the room door opens behind them, Matt is still in that posture, kneeling on the floor, arms wrapped around the boy, Sami's tears soaking through his cloth on the shoulder and chest.

Foggy breathes out a quiet, stunned sound.

Seema covers her gaping mouth with a hand. After a long moment, she whispers, "How did you do that?"

Her kid hasn't let her hold him like this in months.

Matt hears her muttering, not answering. What could he say? That a child needs a father -- and there is nothing that could possibly fill the hole it left behind. All he can do is try, try as hard as he can to get close, like all those other men in his life once did for him.

Matt brings the boy back to his mother's arms.

"I want to teach him boxing," he says, suddenly.

"What?! No, you can't be serious." Foggy blurts out before he can stop himself.

"I am," Matt replies simply.

Foggy looks at him. Matt doesn't need to be able to see his face to sense the look -- torn between frustration and disbelief -- to know exactly what his friend is thinking, as loud and clear as if he's yelling in his ears.

"You're thinking this is how it started for me," Matt says, calm, "And whatever worked for me might not work for him."

"Exactly," Foggy says, breathing out appreciatedly for saving him to make the same argument. He nods heavily, just to emphasize.

"But I think it could help him," Matt says. "It's his choice."

Seema kneels down beside her son. Foggy stands next to them, silently shaking his head.

Sami speaks, every word and syllable clear and deliberate: "I want to learn boxing with Uncle Matt."

<br>

Sami's boxing classes are set every Saturday, at Fogwell's Gym -- the same place that carried far too many memories and Matt is layering it with more.

Taking off his suits and tie, changing into a shirt and gloves, smelling the old scent of sweat and leather wrapping around them, Matt feels something from old time flowing back into his body. It's not the feeling of being Matt Murdock, neither is being Daredevil. This is the feeling of being Jack Murdock's son. Standing at the edge of the ring, facing the training bags, this is the closest he's felt to his father.

And now, across from him, there's another boy looking at him with the same look, searching for his father from the memory.

Matt starts from the basics: footwork, stance, breathing. He corrects his posture, teaching him what he knows. The sandbags grow from a few dozen pounds to hundreds. The boy's punches turn sharper and faster -- sometimes hard enough even Matt barely dodges in time. That's after he's old enough for them to start practicing the moves on each other.

"I think that's it."

One autumn day, after a long session, Matt sets down the pads and says it.

"Same time next Saturday?" Sami asks, peeling off his gloves. He's nearly Matt's height now -- after years, he's grown into a fine-looking young man. Still a teenager, but almost already bearing the shape of a fully grown man. Lean and elegant, agile and well-built, and so unmistakably his father's son.

"I mean, this is it." Matt speaks slowly, ensuring the meaning passes through.

Sami stills, understanding. Matt hears his breath hitches, then his voice uneven: "Why? Sir?" -- the boy started calling him "Sir" not long after they started the lessons, Matt guessed it might be Seema's teaching, after the kid refusing to change the addressing no matter how many times he corrected him, he finally let him be.

The boy asks, "Sir, are you leaving me too? Just like my father?"

Matt sighs, knowing this day would always come, and this is the day. He's not the same man he was ten years ago, but something, the memory, the past, the history that might have become stories people forget, are still there, waiting to be told. He sits down on the edge of the ring, patting the spot next to him, gesturing the boy to do the same.

"Sami," he says, "Let me tell you a story. One that might be different from what you've heard before."

So he tells him. He speaks of the forgotten names and buried truths. Of the people who were brave. Of the darkness so thick it choked out all the hope. And of the ones who still dared to resist it. He tells him about Ray Nadeem, his father, the man who made mistakes, but never stopped trying. The man who wanted nothing more than to atone his mistakes and protect his family, his son.

Sami listens. Quietly. Solemnly.

The boy's memories of his father haven't been much, borrowed from stories told by his mother, built out of family photo albums, some talks from his father's old colleagues and other relatives. He had listened to them talking about his father like hearing a story, spinning around a phantom he barely remembered. It has been growing thin over the years, like mist blown away by wind. When he thinks of the word "father", he can barely imagine a silhouette, a shape in the fog.

Sami listens so intently his hands ache from clutching into the edge of the ring, his eyes locked deadly on Matt, digging into a hole. It's as if he's relearning the man he should have known, should have been familiar with all this time, should have been as his blood flows through his veins.

"Right here, in this exact gym," Matt says, pointing to the space before them, "Ray stood there, and he said he was willing to testify. Whatever the cost, all he wanted was for his family to live a normal life again, for them to not live in fear again.

"He said, he didn't care what the world thought of him, only what his son would think of him."

<br>

Matt stops. He faces that direction blankly, as if looking at the man once standing in front of him through all the time and space, looking at the image in his head.

"You do this, there is no going back," he warned him. "We will be hunted the moment we walk out of that door, until we are killed."

And he answered, "If I don't, there is no going back either. Fisk will control the whole New York, maybe more. If this is the last thing I ever do, at least I want my son to grow up in a better world. One without fear. So, yes, I made my decision. I'm doing this."

Matt realizes, only now that he thinks back, that this young FBI agent might have known he wouldn't ever make it back to his wife and kid, the moment he walked out of that door.

The image in his head morphs into another, the figure turning into another tall, standing man.

Still here. Still Fogwell's Gym. Still that same corner. He doesn't even have to focus too hard to hear their whole conversation. His father said, "No, I'm not doing this." The man before him said, "Think of you son."

What is right, what is wrong? Is it idiotic pride, or the long-lost justice? A failed resistance, or a useless sacrifice? Too many questions, too many answers that never will come. For years, for decades, he asked the phantom in his head: "Why did you leave me?" Until that phantom duplicated, morphing into more figures, turning and passing, coming and leaving, with only their back left behind in the end.

Now, in this stillness, the voices of these two men speak in one, they are saying: "All I'm doing is trying to protect you, to love you, hoping I can be the father you're proud to have. Forgive me for my clumsy, terrible, erroneous, failing way, the way that got me killed and took me away from you. But I tried, I tried my best. So please forgive me. If you can't be proud of me, at least don't be ashamed. Okay?"

He thinks, finally -- finally -- he finds the answer. He understands.

<br>

In the quiet of the gym, there is the sound of a boy sobbing.

Matt wipes his own eyes, his fingertips come away damp.

"Your father was the bravest man I ever met," he says. "And believe me when I say this -- he never left you. Not really. Even until the last moment, even after that, he's still with you, with us. Even now."

Matt lifts his face toward the sky, tracing a cross over his chest slowly.

"I remember," Sami starts, still sniffling a little, "on my birthdays, he always tried to make me a birthday cake."

Matt turns toward him.

"It wasn't really a cake," the boy looks at the floor, remembering with a small smile. "He never learned how to make cake. He'd just take slices of bread my mom made, put some cheese and other fillings in between, then stuff some fries on the top pretending they were candles. He'd act like it was the best birthday cake ever. And mom and I would pretend it was -- it actually didn't taste bad, believe it or not."

Matt chuckles softly with him.

"He used to always say he'd build a pool in the backyard and teach me to swim in the summer, every time he was home and had some time. Every year he said it. And I still... even now, I still kind of expect to see it when I walk home. Like maybe it'll be there one day. And he'll be waiting next to the pool, smiling at me..." Sami's voice drops, his smile falling.

"I really miss him," he says quietly.

"I know," Matt says. What he really wants to say is: Me too.

"I guess, I always kind of knew he wouldn't leave us. Whatever he chose to do, it must have been the best choice he could find," the boy says, jumping off the ring, brushing his hand over the battered sandbag absentmindedly. "So I guess, I just got mad because I didn't know where to put all that missing him. It almost felt like... if I was angry, then maybe I wouldn't feel sad. And if I didn't feel sad, I wouldn't feel weak..."

"I know," Matt says again. So familiar the feeling, as if he's facing the young version of himself.

"But you know, sadness is because of missing, missing is because of love. And love never makes you weak," he tells the boy, following him off the ring, talking to him, and gently taking his hand.

He presses Sami's hand over his own chest where the young heartbeat is strong and steady.

"Can you feel that?" Matt says quietly. "Your father, the people you love, the people we thought we'd lost, they're all right here. In every heartbeat. They'll be here with you, always."

Sami nods again, hard, eyes wet.

Matt smiles faintly, letting go of his hands, taking a few steps away, as if suddenly not sure of what to do next, so he tries to start packing away the equipment.

Sami's hands are still on his chest, and he says, "I'll keep you here too, Sir."

Matt's move stills for a brief moment.

The boy continues, "And I want you to be the first to know. I've decided what I want to do in the future -- I'm going to study criminal law, I want to join the FBI, just like my father."

Matt nods. He thinks he probably shouldn't be surprised.

He tells him, "Your father would be proud of you."

The boy doesn't answer.

So Matt adds, "But before that, before anything else, remember to be a good man. Try your best. That's what your father would want most."

He pauses, then almost laughs at himself, shaking his head. "When did I become the one giving lectures? I'm really getting old."

Sami grins, then promises seriously, "I will."

<br>

Fogwell's Gym falls quiet again after Sami left. Matt presses his palm to his chest, and the phantom of his father appears before his eyes. The shape so clear that the image in his mind rules over the vision of his eyes.

Matt whispers, "Thanks, Dad."

His father answers him, "You were never alone, Matty. You were never left behind, deserted, unwanted, unloved, or anything like that. Not for a second."

The phantom becomes more people -- Stick, Father Lantom, Elektra, his mother, Foggy, Karen...

Different voices merge into one sentence, they're all saying: "We're here for you, all the time, always."

Matt smiles, a smile so innocent and bright he's almost like a child.

"I know," he says, "I know now."

He's finally not alone.
