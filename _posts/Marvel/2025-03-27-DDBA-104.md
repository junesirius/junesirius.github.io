didn't realize the power of cinematographic language until about the third time rewatching the part before and during Matt's visit to Frank's place

Right after he feels the bullet has Punisher's mark, the two frames immediately after that, the light is blinding. As glaring as his realization. It's no coincidence, purely a brilliant cinematographic design. That's probably practically *the* moment he decides on the change, and Frank knows and sees it all, just gives him the last push that he needs. Like Frank says, he's there for permission.

These two frames, the lighting and angle, that's exactly where novels would spend paragraphs after paragraphs into the character's head, showing what's in his mind, what he's thinking, writing in his POV. But for a show, in a screenplay, it's just one frame of lighting, and the angle of seeing him from a low angle, seeing his figure large and bright. Everything is conveyed just by that.

It's so brilliant and powerful.

I don't believe Disney would let a rainbow color slip into the frame just by accident. And by some miracle right where Matt's hand touches Frank's waist.

Fratt, you're official.
