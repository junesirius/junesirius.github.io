## Foreword

> It doesn't matter who you are or where you are, The Secret can give you whatever you want.

> As you travel through its pages and you learn The Secret, you will come to know how you can have, be, or do anything you want. You will come to know who you really are. You will come to know the true magnificence that awaits you.

是因为长大了吗，最近重读了一些小时候读过的极喜欢的、对我影响极大的书，很多甚至几乎读不下去。尤其是这本《秘密》，特别是这本《秘密》。十多年了，吸引力法则始终是我相信的，在desperate的时候求诸的，可现在，甚至从foreword开始，已经感到难以卒读。太多的positivity，甚至令人不适，已经开始感觉，这不过是廉价书店新书区的又一本心灵鸡汤，如果现在的我第一次见到这样一本书，一定会在翻开第一页就扔下的。或许其实也从很早就隐约意识到了，吸引力法则本就是一种心灵鸡汤，可还是想要去相信，假装去相信，可现在，连这种假装都变得更难了。

也可能因为这是第一次看英文原版？总感觉比小时候反复读的中文版感觉大不相同。不过仍然觉得更多是因为心态变老了，苦涩的成年人生活啊，消磨尽了希望和热情，已经让positivity变成一种令人厌恶想要逃开的东西，因为知道，生活不会是那样的。

不知道继续读下去，我会不会重新开始相信，还是更加厌恶，然后丢掉从小就掌握的生活魔法呢。

愤世嫉俗，这是我在寻找的词。这也是为什么开始对读到的每一个句子都感到skeptical。critical thinking，大概是好事，我猜，不去只是单纯地盲目相信读到的东西，但也……在这种情况下，对这本书来说，完全地阻止了我相信任何东西。

## The Secret Revealed

如果这秘密真的像他们宣传的那么神奇，为什么不是所有人早已掌握。如果他们知道怎么用秘密实现他们所有梦想，他们为什么没有已经得到了他们所说的一切。

看看那些接受采访者和被用来当做证据的专家们的身份和职业：

- Bob Proctor: 哲学家，作家，personal coach
- Dr. Joe Vitale: metaphysician（直译的话，玄学家），marketing specialist, 作家
- Dr. John Demartini: 哲学家，personal tranformation specialist
- Dr. Denis Waitley: psychologist, trainer in the field of mind potential
- Michael Bernard Backwith: visionary and founder of Agape International Spiritual Center
- Jack Canfield: 作家，老师，life coach, motivational speaker

换句话说，几乎每一个，都是靠嘴皮子和空想来谋生的。他们的证词，实在没有什么说服力。为什么小时候的我好像从来没有注意过他们的职业呢，还是觉得，那些成年人，看起来好像是成功人士？只要是引用的话，看起来就很有说服力？直到开始关注究竟是从哪里引用来的。

> I've seen many miracles take place in people's lives.

那可不，邀请全世界的人开始相信他们的秘密，从概率上说，哪怕他们什么都不做，奇迹也会这样发生。跟那些在电视节目上宣称他们可以隔空让观众家里灯泡爆炸的超能力者没什么不同。

于是更加感到痛苦了，心灵鸡汤着实失去了它的魅力。想要get me excited and enthusiastic again, you got to do better than this.

> We all work with one infinite power. We all guide ourselves by exactly the same laws.

要是把这power换成force，就可以当做是在读星战了。。没什么不同的。不过说起来本来也是，force的概念确实很有东方神秘学的味道，卢卡斯本就热爱日本文化的。

> The Secret is the law of attraction.
>
> Everything that's coming into your life you are attracting into your life. And it's attracted to you by virtue of the images you're holding in your mind. *It's what you're thinking.* Whatever is going on in your mind you are attracting to you.

倒是更像梦境理论了。这个现实本就是我的梦，我的大脑可以凭着它所想到的一切来塑造和改变这个现实。

某种程度上，尤其是当detachment更严重的时候，倒确实可以相信这一点。

> Every thought of yours is a real thing - a force.
>
> ——Prentice Mulford (1834-1891)

这位Prentice又是何许人也呢，一位幽默作家。

小时候也从来不会在看见每一个人名时真的去求证去检查他们到底是谁，现在习惯性会去查证自己读到的东西之后就再也不会什么都相信了……

大概这也是为什么这本书的团队去拍的电影永远不会有什么好评——看的成年人多了，愤世嫉俗的bitter and soul的疲惫的灵魂多了，不相信的人多了，他们这套“心想事成”的心灵鸡汤就卖不出去了。所以在看见那些差评低分电影时就可以知道，其实书也没什么不同，所以倒是很有些好奇这本书最初是怎么开始风靡起来的了。

> Poets such as William Shakespeare, Robert Browning, and William Blake delivered it in their poetry. Musicians such as Ludwig van Beethoven expressed it through their music. Artists such as Leonardo da Vinci depicted it in their paintings. Great thinkers including Socrates, Plato, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Pythagoras, Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Issac Newton, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Victor Hugo shared it in their writings and teachings. Their names have been immortalized, and their lengendary existence has survived centuries.

贝多芬怎么就把吸引力法则写在乐谱里了，达芬奇怎么就画了。只靠甩一些big name来显得impressive是没有说服力的。除非告诉我具体的表现，不然这些只会显得好像desperate寻找证据时随手拉来做垫背又不用担心会被警告的，毕竟贝多芬和达芬奇也没法指着这行字说这不是他们想在作品里表达的。

> Wise people have always known this. You can go right back to the ancient Babylonians. They've always known this. It's a small select group of people.
>
> The ancient Babylonians and their great prosperity have been weel documented by scholars. They are also known for creating one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Through their understanding and application of the laws of the Universe, they became one of the wealthiest races in history.

古巴比伦人知道吸引力法则，然后吸引来了自己的灭亡？这可不是什么好例子。

> The law responds to your thoughts, no matter what they may be.

### Like Attracts Like

> The simplest way for me to look at the law of attraction is if I think of myself as a magnet, and I know that a magnet will attract to it.
>
> You are the most powerful magnet in the Universe! You contain a magnetic power within you that is more powerful than anything in this world, and this unfathomable magnetci power is emiited through your thoughts.

开始想起来小时候为什么选择相信了，因为也确实见证过不少次吸引力法则确实给了我我想要的，而且很难解释。最近一次深切地感受到或许真的有用是因为……翻到了大学开学前对新室友的想象，现在完全忘记自己写过那些，但是对照时发现，是真的几乎完全正确。这种时候就不得不相信或许宇宙里真的有某种力量会回馈我的许愿了。

其实对这类心灵鸡汤来说，他们的说法到底包装了什么或许并不重要，这里他们用的词汇是吸引力法则，随便什么别的名字定义也都不重要，其实核心也不过是想让读者看完之后可以开始保持一个积极的心态，focus在重要的、他们想要实现的事情上，不要focus在恐惧和别的negative thoughts上，专注在眼前真实的东西上，诸如此类。无论这种法则和别的包装是否真实并不重要——大部分时候大概是不存在的——但是如果被引导着真的做到了那些，便也能实现心态平和，deterministic，对未来充满希望，对现实充满热情，然后便没有什么做不到的了。冥想和心理医生很多时候也不过是为了实现这些，所以假装去相信，然后慢慢靠拢那些真正想要实现的心理状态，倒也是可行的。

> Bob Doyle: 作家，law of attraction specialist

哈，吸引力法则专家，难道是因为觉得如果不加上这句就会让title显得太短吗？又实在想不出别的可以写的句子了，真的很像是在凑数的title呢，就像简历上写不出东西时的胡编乱造。

> The law of attraction says *like attracts like*, and so as you think a thought, you are also attracting *like* thoughts to you.

把大脑的联想能力也称作是吸引力法则的证据……倒也不能说错。崩溃时的negative loop就是这样陷进去的……

> Our job as humans is to hold on to the thoughts of what we want, make it absolutely clear in our minds what we want, and from that we start to invoke one og the greatest laws in the Universe, and that's the law of attraction. You become what you think about most, but you also attract what you think about most.
>
> Your life right now is a reflection of your past thoughts.

> If you see it in your mind, you're going to hold it in your hand.
>
> If you can think about what you want in your mind, and make that your dominant thought, you *will* bring it into your life.

> *Thoughts become things!*

简单来说这是一本教你怎么专注和控制思绪的书，不管是不是跟吸引力法则有关。这个角度来看，很多建议倒也说得上是有些帮助的。

> What most people don't understand is that a thought has a frequency. We can measure a thought. And so if you're thinking that thought over and over and over again, if you're imagining in your mind having that brand new car, having the money that you need, building that company, finding your soul mate... if you're imagining what that looks like, you're emitting that frequency on a consistent basis.
>
> You are a human transmission tower, and you are more powerful than any television tower created on earth. You are the most pwoerful transmission tower in the Universe. Your transmission cerated your life and it creates the world. The frequency you transmit reaches beyond cities, beyond countries, beyond the world, It reverberates throughout the entire Universe. Any you are trnasmitting that frequency *with your thoughts*!

Focus on what you want, not what you fear, basically.

### Attract the good instead of the bad

> The law of attraction doesn't care whether you perceive something to be good or bad, or whether you don't want it or whether you do want it. It's responding to your thoughts. So if you're looking at a mountain of debt, feeling terrible about it, that's the signal you're putting out into the Universe. "I feel really bad because of all this debt I've got." You're just affirming it to yourself. You feel it on every level of your being. That's what you're going to get more of.

> The law of attraction is not biased to wants or don't wants. When you focus on something, no matter what it happens to be, you really are calling that into existence.
>
> That law of attraction doesn't compute "don't" or "not" or "no," or any other words of negation. As you speak words of negation, this is what the law of attraction is receiving.

（摘了一句不喜欢的句子，想了想然后把它删掉了。既然不要focus在negative上，那就不要让那个讨厌的句子写在这里然后每次看见还要想一下有多讨厌它）

> The law of attraction is the law of creation. Quantum physicists tell us that the entire Universe emerged from thought.

呃，量子力学好像没这么说过。

> What you are thinking now is creating your future life. You create your life with your thoughts. Because you are always thinking, you are always creating. What you think about the most or focus on the most, is what will appear as your life.

如果只是focus在我愿意相信的部分，这本书倒还算读得下去。但也不过如此了。

太快太简单粗暴地把因和果联系在一起，得出“只要你……就能……”的结论，这是大部分心灵鸡汤的通病了，太容易地导致那些结论显得不可信服。让读者无法相信的文字，都不能算成功的。连剧本和小说都要在这一点上付出些努力，心灵鸡汤却做得如此糟糕。

> Your life is in your hands. No matter where you are now, no matter what has happened in your life, you can begin to consciously choose your thoughts, and you can change your life. There is no such thing as a hopeless situation. Every single circumstance of your life can change.

### The Power of your Mind

> If you don't understand the law that doesn't mean you should reject it. You may not understand electricity, and yet you enjoy the benefits of it. I don't know how it works. But I do know this: You can cook a man's dinner with electricity, and you can also cook the man!

汉，汉尼拔是你吗 lol

相信宗教的人想象出一个神来爱他们，相信吸引力法则的人想象自己是创造世界的神，想象自己创造出周围的人，让想象出的人来爱自己。所以……某种程度上说这也是一种宗教？

> Oftentimes when people begin to understand the Great Secret, they become frightened of all the negative thoughts that they have. They need to be aware that is has been scientifically proven that an affirmative thought is hundreds of times more powerful than a negative thought. That eliminates a degree of worry right there.

“scientifically proven”... 如果是我的话会很小心地用这几个字的。

> You want to become aware of your thoughts and choose your thoughts carefully and you want to have fun with this, because you are the masterpiece of your own life. You are the Michelangelo of your own life. The David you are sculpting is you.

> One way to master your mind is to learn to quiet your mind. Without exception, every teacher in this book uses meditation as a daily practice. It wasn't until I discovered The Secret that I realized how powerful meditation can be. **<u>Meditation quiets your mind, helps you control your thoughts, and revitalizes your body.</u>** The great news is that you don't have to set aside hours to meditate. Just three to ten minutes a day to begin with, can be incredibly powerful for gaining control over your thoughts.

啊果然是冥想。

吸引力法则需要冥想，绝地练习原力也需要冥想。

### Summary

> - The Great Secret of Life is the law of attraction.
> - The law of attraction says *like attracts like*, so when you think a thought, you are also attracting *like* thoughts to you.
> - Thoughts are magnetic, and thoughts have a frequency. As you think thoughts, they are sent out into the Universe, and they magnetically attract all like things that are on the same frequency. Everything sent out returns to the source - you.
> - You are like a human transmission tower, transmitting a frequency with your thoughts. If you want to change anything in your life, change the frequency by changing your thoughts.
> - Your current thoughts are creating your future life. What you think about the most or focus on the most will appear as your life.
> - Your thoughts become things.

## The Secret Made Simple

> You have a choice right now. Do you want to believe that it's just the luck of the draw and bad things can happen to you at any time? Do you want to believe that you can be in the wrong place at the wrong time? That you have no control over circumstances?
>
> Or do you want to believe and *know* that your life experience is in your hands and that only all *good* can come into your life because that is the way you think? You have a choice, and whatever you choose to think *will* become your life experience.
>
> Nothing can come into your experience unless you summon it through persistent thoughts.

心灵鸡汤作者们还真是非常……知道怎么把人煽动起来，就像那种经典的集会演说家，给你一个显而易见的选择，然后你就会默默开始跟着演说的方向走，还会觉得那是自己的选择。把思维方式框死在一个范畴里，就让人很容易放弃思考。尤其当对方看上去真的很相信他自己说的话的时候，就更容易放弃思考了。二十页之后，我也开始懒于怀疑了，开始陷入“假设这些都是对的那么……”的自我麻痹的思维陷阱。大概这就是为什么心灵鸡汤到现在都还卖得出去。

> It's impossible to monitor every thought we have. Researchers twll us that we have about sixty thousand thoughts a day. Can you imagine how exhausted you'd feel trying to control all sixty thousand of those thoughts? Fortunately there's an easier way, and it's our feelings. Our feelings let us know what we're thinking.

> You want to become aware of how you're feeling, and get in tune with how you're feeling, because it is the fastest way for you to know what you're thinking.
>
> You have two sets of feelings: good feelings and bad feelings. And you know the difference between the two because one makes you feel good, and the other makes you feel bad. It's the depression, it's the anger, it's the resentment, it's the guilt. It's those feelings that don't make you feel empowered. Those are the bad feelings.

Now that sounds exactly like Jedi code.

> Your thoughts determine your frequency, and your feelings tell you immediately what frequency you are on.

> Your feelings are your frequency feedback mechanism.
>
> So when you are feeling bad it is communication from the Universe, and in effect it is saying, "Warning! Change thinking now. Negative frequency recording. Change frequency. Counting down to manifestation. Warning!"

心灵鸡汤发挥影响力的另一个手法：use affirmative words. 让每句话都说得非常绝对，非常肯定，让人下意识不会去怀疑。陈述句，感叹句，反问句，极其自信，让读者忍不住也下意识就相信了。

> Now here is where you can harness your feelings and use them to turbo-charge what you want in your life.
>
> You can purposefully use your feelings to transmit an even more powerful frequnency, by adding *feeling* to what you are wanting.
>
> *You can begin right now to feel healthy. You can begin to feel prosperous. You can begin to feel the love that's surrounding you, even if it's not there. And what will happen is the universe will correspond to the nature of your song. The universe will correspond to the nature of that inner feeling and manifest, because that's the way you feel.*

> **<u>One way is to close your eyes (shutting out distractions), focus on your feelings inside, and smile for one minute.</u>**

> You create your own universe as you go along.
>
> ——Winston Churchill

引用的另一个不容易让人察觉的trick：你不知道他是什么时候什么情境下说的某一句话。单独摘一句话太容易显得好像那些句子、那些人都是在佐证你想表达的观点，尽管他们说的时候很可能是别的意思。几乎非常确定丘吉尔在说这句时是在想别的事而非指吸引力法则。

> When you're feeling down, did you know that you can change it in an instant? Put on a beautiful piece of music, or start singing - that'll change your emotion. Or think of something beautiful. Think of somebody that you truly love, and dwell on it. Really keep that thought in your mind. Block everything out but that thought. I guarantee you'll start to feel good.

Not that easy, have you ever experienced depression?

> **<u>Make a list of some Secret Shifters</u>** to  have up your sleeve. By Secret Shifters, I mean things that can change your feelings in a snap. It might be beautiful memories, future events, funny moments, nature, a person you love, your favorite music. Then if you find yourself angry or frustrated or not feeling good, turn to your Secret Shifters list and focus on one of them. Different things will shift you at different times, so if one doesn't work, go to another. It only takes a minute or two of changing focus to shift yourself and shift your frequency.

这倒确实是个好方法，而且我也做了。

### Love: The Greatest Emotion

> There is no greater power in the Universe than the power of love. The feeling of love is the highest frequency you can emit. If you could wrap every thought in love, if you could love everything and everyone, your life would be transformed.

Love everything and everyone, 这就不叫love，该叫compassion了。完全就像绝地。

> In fact, some of the grat thinkers of the past referred to the law of attraction as the law of love. And if you think about it, you will understand why. If you think unkind thoughts about someone else, *you* will experience those unkind thoughts manifested. You cannot harm another with your thoughts, you only harm You. If you think thoughts of love, guess who receives the benefits - you! So if your predominant state is love, the law of attraction or the law of love responds with the mightiest force because you are on the highest frequency possible. The greater the love you feel and emit, the greater the power you are harnessing.

> The most important question any human being can ask themselves is, "*Is this a friendly Universe?*"
>
> Knowing the law of attraction, the only answer to give is, "Yes, the Universe is friendly." Why? Because when you answer in this way, by the law of attraction you must experience that.
>
> To take it even further, you can affirm and proclaim, "This is a maginicent Universe. The Universe is bringing all good things to me. The Universe is conspiring for me in all things. The Universe is supporting me in everything I do. The Universe meets all my needs immediately." *Knowing* that this is a friendly Universe!

> This is *your* life, and it's been waiting for you to discover it! Up until now you may have been thinking that life is hard and a struggle, and so by the law of attraction you will have experienced life as hard and a struggle. Begin right now to shout to the universe, "*Life is so easy! Life is so good! All good things come to me!*"
>
> There is a truth deep down inside of you that has been waiting for you to discover it, and that Truth is this: *<u>you deserve all good things life has to offer.</u>* You know that inherently, because you feel awful when you are experiencing the lack of good things. All good things are your birthright! You are the creator of you, and the law of attraction is your magificent tool to create whatever you want in your life. Welcome to the magic of life, and the magificent of You!

All good things come to me!

I deserve all good things life has to offer!

All good things are my birthright!

### Summary

> - The law of attraction is a law of nature. It is as impartial as the law of gravity.
> - Nothing can come into your experience unless you summon it through persistent thoughts.
> - To know what you're thinking, ask yourself how you are feeling. Emotions are valuable tools that instantly tell us what we are thinking.
> - It is impossible to feel bad and at the same time have good thoughts.
> - Your thoughts determine your frequency, and your feelings tell you immediately what frequency you are on. When you feel bad, you are on the frequency of the drawing more bad things. When you feel good, you are powerfully attracting more good things to you.
> - Secret Shifters, such as pleasant memories, nature, or your favorite music, can change your feelings and shift your frequency in an instant.
> - The feeling of love is the highest frequency you can emit. Thre greater the love you feel and emit, the greater ther power you are harnessing.

## How to Use the Secret

眼一瓢把这章标题看成How to use the force，感觉这本书几乎像是原力指导手册了。某种程度上说也没错。

> Now, let's take this metaphor and apply it to your life. Remember Aladdin is the one who always asks for what he wants. Then you've got the Universe at large, which is the Genie. Traditions have called it so many things - your holy guardian angel, your higher self. We can put any label on it, and you choose the one that works best for you, but every tradition has told us there's something bigger than us. And the Geinie always says on thing:
>
> "*Your wish is my command!*"

> This wonderful story demonstrates how your whole life and everything in it hasa been created by You. The Genie has simply answered your every command. The Genie is the law of attraction, and it is always present and always listening to everything you think, speak, and act. The Genie assumes that everything you think about, you want! That everything you speak about, you want! That everything you act upon is what you want! You are the Master of the Universe, and the Genie is there to serve you. The Genie never questions your commands. You think it, and the Genie immediately begins to leverage the Universe, through people, circumstances, and events, to fulfill your wish.

但是神灯精灵的故事……就像Monkey's paw的故事，总是在警告我们对这种心想事成的好事保持警惕，对于许愿的事充满警惕，因为你永远不知道你许下的愿望在实现时是否是你想要的模样，即使是的，又以什么为代价。

### The Creative Process

#### Step 1: Ask

> The first step is to ask. Make a command to the Universe. Let the Universe know what you want. The Universe responds to your thoughts.

> What do you really want? Sit down and write it out on a piece of paper. Write it in the present tense. You might begin by writing, "I am so happy and grateful now that... " And then explain how you want your life to be, in every area.

这是早就已经开始实践的第一步，以“我是多么快乐和感激因为……”开头写写自己想要的生活。

翻译成非心灵鸡汤版本的话，就是说第一步要知道自己到底想要什么。

Remember what you really want.

然后才可能知道接下来该为之做些什么。

> <u>You get to choose what you want, but you must get clear about what you want.</u> This is your work. If you're not clear, then the law of attraction cannot bring you what you want. You will be sending out a mixed frequency and you can only attract mixed results. For the first time in your life perhaps, work out what it is you really want. Now that you know you can have, be, or do anything, and there are no limits, what do you want?

> This is really fun. It's like having the Universe as your catelogue. You flip through it and say, "I'd like to have this experience and I'd like to have that product and I'd like to have a person like that." It is You placing your order with the Universe. It's really that easy.

倒是一直很喜欢这个“向宇宙下单”的比喻。

#### Step 2: Believe

> Step two is believe. Believe it's already yours. Have what I love to call unwavering faith. Believing in the unseen.

开始心诚则灵的环节了。

> You must believe that you have received. You must know that what you want is yours the moment you ask. You must have complete and utter faith. If you had placed an order from a catelogue you would relax, know you are going to receive what you ordered, and get on with your life.

> See the things that you want as already yours. Know that they will come to you at need. Then let them come. Don't fret and worry about them. Don't think about your lack of them. Think of them as yours, as belonging to you, as already in your possession.

> You must act, speak, and think, as though you are receiving it *now*.

#### Step 3: Receive

> Begin to feel wonderful about it. Feel the way you will feel once it arrives. Feel it now.

> And in this process it's important to feel good, to be happy, because when you're feeling good you're putting yourself in the frequency of what you want.

> A fast way to get yourself on that frequency is to say, "I am receiving now. I am receiving all the good in my life, now. I am receiving [fill in your desire] now." And *feel* it. *Feel* it as though you have received.

这是一种“让脑子先过去”的trick。假装已经做完了一件事，然后去想象中去回忆自己是怎么做的，然后告诉现在这个自己。写文和做别的一些艰难的事情时候经常这么干，确实很有帮助打开大脑。仿佛自己得到了未来自己的帮助。

> Action will sometimes be required, but if you're really doing it in line with what the Universe is trying to bring to you, it's going to fiel joyous. You're going to feel so alive. Time will just stop. You could do it all days.

> *Action* is a word that can imply "work" to some people, but inspired action will not fell like work at all.

终于这就是wandering的整个理论的终点了：还是要自己去做，去劳动，还不应该有抱怨。

> Trust your instincs. It's the Universe inspiring you. It's the Universe communicating with you on the receiving frequency. If you have an intuitive or  instinctive feeling, follow it, and you will find that the Universe is magnetically moving you to receive what you asked for.

相信直觉，绝地也是这么教的。

> Trust the Universe. Trust and believe and have faith.

### The Secret and Yout Body

> Let's look at using the Creative Process for those who feel they are overweight and who want to lose weight.
>
> ... (Step 3: Receive)
>
> You must feel good. You must feel good about You. This is important, because you cannot attract your perfect weight if you feel bad about your body now. If you feel bad about your body, that is a powerful feeling, and you will continue to attract feeling bad about your body. You will never change your body if you are critical of it and find fault with it, and in fact you will attract more weight to you. Praise and bless every square inch of your body. Think about all the perfect things about You. As you think perfect thoughts, as you feel good about You, you are on the frequency of your perfect weight, and you are summoning perfection.

悦纳你自己。

### How Long Does it Take?

> Time is just an illusion. Einstain told us that. If this is the first time you have heard it, you may find it a hard concept to get your head around, because you see everything happening - one thing after the other. What quantum physicists and Einstein tell us is that eveything is happening simultaneously. If you can understand that there is no time, and accept that concept, then you will see that whatever you want in the future already exists. If everything is happening at the one time, then the parallel version of you with what you want *already* exists!

原来是平行宇宙梗，爱因斯坦相对论我不记得说过这个parallel universe的宇宙，套一个量子力学的名头更加感觉像是在用高端名词装B为了方便回去以后交差。

但是平行宇宙梗确实是可以用。

> Size is nothing to the Universe. It is no more difficult to attract, on a scientific level, something that we consider huge to something that we consider infinitesimally small.
>
> The Universe does everything with zero effort. The grass doesn't straing to group. It's effortless. It's just this great design.
>
> It's all about what's going on in your mind. It's about what we put in place, saying, "This is big, it's going to take some time." And, "This is small. I'll give it an hour. Those are rules that we define. There are no rules according to the Universe. You provide the feelings of having it now; it will respond - whatever it is.

> There is no time for the Universe and there is no size for the Universe. It is as easy to manifest one dollar as it is to manifest one million dollars.

There is no time or size for the Universe. 喜欢这个想法。

### Create Your Day in Advance

> When you say to yourself, 'I am going to have a pleasant visit or a pleasant journey,' you are literally sending elements and forces ahead of your body that will arrange things to make your visit or journey pleasant.

> Many people, particularly in Western societies, chase "time" and complain that they *don't have enough time*. Well, as someone says that they don't have enough time, so it must be by the law of attraction. If you have been chasing your tail with thoughts of not having enough time, from now on declare emphatically, 'I have more than enough time,' and change your life.

I have more than enough time!

### Summary

> - Like Aladdin's Genie, the law of attraction grants our every command.
> - The Creative Process helps you create what you want in three simple steps: ask, believe, and receive.
> - *Asking* the Universe for what you want is your opportunity to get clear about what you want. As you get clear in your mind, you have asked.
> - *Believing* involves acting, speaking, and thinking as though you have already received what you've asked for. When you emit the frequency of having received it, the law of attraction moves people, events, and circumstances for you to receive.
> - *Receiving* involves feeling the way you will feel once your desire has manifested. Feeling good now puts you on the frequency of what you want.
> - To lose weight, don't focus on "losing weight," Instead, focus on your perfect weight. Feel the feelings of your perfect weight, and you will summon it to you.
> - It takes no time for the Universe to manifest what you want. It is as easy to manifest one dollar as it is to manifest one million dollars.
> - Starting with something small, like a cup of coffee or parking spaces, is an easy way to experience the law of attraction in action. Powerfully intend to attract something small. As you experience the power you have to attract, you will move on to creating much bigger things.
> - Create your day in advance by thinking the way you want it to go, and you will create your life intentionally.

相信你有改变自己命运的办法，让自己变得自信，然后去改变。确实是很简单的原理了。只是用了不同的方法来实现。

## Powerful Processes

> A lot of people feel stuck or imprisoned or confined by their current circumstances. Whatever your circumstances right now, that is only your current reality, and current reality will begin to change as a result of beginning to use The Secret.

Yes, and exactly why I start re-reading The Secret now.

> Your current reality or your current life is a result of the thoughts you have been thinking. All of that will totally change as you begin to change your thoughts and your feelings.

> Expectation is a powerful attractive force, because it draws things to you. As Bob Proctor says, "Desire connects you with the thing desired and expectation draws it into your life." Expect the things you want, and don't expect the things you don't want. What do you expect now?

> Neville (Goddard) recommends at the end of every day, before you go to sleep, to think through the events of the day. If any events or moments did not go the way you wanted, replay them in your mind in a way that thrills you. As you recreate those events in your mind exactly as you want, you are cleaning up your frequency for tomorrow. You have intentionally created new pictures for your future. It is never too late to change the pictures.

### The Powerful Process of Gratitude

> What can you do right now to begin to turn your life around? The very first thing is to start making a list of things to be grateful for. This shifts your energy and starts to shift your thinking. Whereas before this exercise you might be focusing on what you don't have, your copmlaints, and your problems, you go in a different direction when you do this exercise. You start to be grateful for all the things that you feel good about.

> Gratitude has been such a powerful exercise for me. Every morning I get up and say "Thank you." Every morning, when my feet hit the floor, "Thank you." And then I start running through what I'm grateful for, as I'm brushing my teeth and doing the things I do in the morning. And I'm not just thinking about them and doing some rote routine. I'm putting it out there and I'm feeling the feelings of gratitude.

> As I do this, I am powerfully creating my day and all that it will contain. I am setting my frequency for the day and intentionally declaring the way I want my day to go, rather than stumbling out of bed and letting the day take control of me. There is no more powerful way to begin your day than this. You are the creator of your life, and so begin by intentionally creating your day!

对每一件事说“谢谢”，确实是试过这个方法的，也确实非常有效，可以把注意力完全拉到现实的眼下，哪怕只是让嘴说出“谢谢”这个音，哪怕一开始并没有真的把注意力放在感恩上，慢慢地也会开始feel good，会真的开始对这个世界里每一件小的东西和事情感到感激。

> Each morning before you get out of bed, make it a habit to feel the feelings of gratitude *in advance* for the great day ahead, as though it is done.

### The Powerful Process of Visualization

> The reason visualization is so powerful is because as you create pictures in your mind of seeing yourself with what it is you want, you are generating thoughts and feelings of having it now. Visualization is simply powerfully focused thought in pictures, and it causes equally powerful feelings. When you are visualizing, you are emitting that powerful frequency out into the Universe. The law of attraction will take hold of that powerful signal and return those pictures back to you, just as you saw them in your mind.

> **<u>If you've been there in the mind you'll go there in the body.</u>**

让心先过去。

> You want to do this virtually daily, but it should never be a chore. What's really important to the whole Secret is feeling good. You want to feel exhilarated by this whole process. You want to be high, happy, in tune, as much as possible.

> Here's a tip about visualizing: if you create a static picture in your mind it can be difficult to hold that picture, so create lots of movement in your picture.

对想象剧本里的画面同样适用。

### The Powerful Process in Action

> Knowing the law of attraction, I wanted to really put it to use and to see what would happen. In 1995 I started to create something called a Vision Board, where I take somethign that I want to achieve, or something that I want to attract, like a car or a watch or the soul mate of my dreams, and I put a picture of what I want up on this board. Every day I would sit in my office and I would look up at this board and I would start to visualize. I would really get into the state of having already acquired it.
>
> I was getting ready to move. We put all the furniture, all the boxes, into storage, and I made three different moves over a period of five years. And then I ended up in California and bought this house, renovated it for a year, and then had all the stuff brought from my former home five years earlier. One morning my son Keenan came into my office, and one of the boxes that was sealed for five years was right at the doorstep. He asked, "What's in the boxes, Daddy?" And I said, "Those are my Vision Boards." He then asked, "What's a Vision Board?" I said, "Well, it's where I put all my goals up. I cut them out and I put all my goals up as somethign that I want to achieve in my life." Of course at five and a half years old he didn't understand, and so I said, "Sweetheart, let me just show you, that'll be the easiest way to do it."
>
> I cut the box open, and on one Vision Board was a picture of a home that I was visualizing five years earlier. What was shocking was that we were living in that house. Not a house like it - I actually bought my dream home, renovated it, and didn't even know it. I looked at that house and I started to cry, because I was just blown away. Keenan asked, "Why are you crying? " "I finally understand how the law of attraction works. I dinally understand the power of visualization. I finally understand everything that I've read, everything that I've worked with my whole life, the way I've built companies. It worked for my home as well, and I bourght our dream home and didn't even know it."

我也有我的愿景板，从十年前就有了。我还记得我在上面许下了什么愿。我相信我会得到它们的。

> Decide what you want. Believe you can have it. Believe you deserve it and believe it's possible for you. And then close your eyes every day for several minutes, and visualize having what you already want, feeling the feelings of already having it. Come out of that and focus on what you're grateful for already, and really enjoy it. Then go into your day and reliease it to the Universe and trust that the Universe will figure out how to manifest it.

我可以看见我抱着我的黑猫站在立式化妆镜前，镜子里反射出我的完美身材，这是我的家，从窗户看出去可以看见海，外面阳光灿烂。窗前的书桌上放着我写完的剧本和新初版的best-selling的书的样刊，抽屉里放着我的英文封面的护照。我没有看见但我知道，在这个家的另一个房间里，大概是客厅，有另一个女孩子，我的伴侣，我的合作伙伴，我的共同作者，我的书和剧本的第一位读者，我的猫的另一位母亲。只要我想，我可以现在就走到她身边去拥抱她亲吻她。我全心全意地信任她，爱她。我拥有我想要的一切。此刻的我是多么感激和快乐。

I feel happy. I feel healthy. I feel safe. I feel loved.

瞧，原来我还是知道我想要的生活的。

## The Secret to Money

> One of The Secrets is that when you have an inspired thought, you have to trust it and act on it.

> To attract money, you must focus on wealth. You have to emit a new signal with your thoughts, and those thoughts should be that you currently have more than enough. You really do need to call your imagination into play and make believe you already have the money you want. And it is so much fun to do! You will notice as you pretend and play games of having wealth that you feel instantly better about money, and as you feel better about it, it will begin to flow into your life.

### Attract Abundance

> The only reason any person does not have enough money is because they are *blocking* money from coming to them with their thoughts. Every negative thought, feeling, or emotion is *blocking* your good from coming to you, and that includes moeny. It is not that the money is being kept from you by the Universe, because all the money you require exists right now in the invisible. If you do not have enough, it is because you are stopping the flow of money coming to you, and you are doing that with your thoughts. You must tip the balance of your thoughts from lack-of-money to more-than-enough-money. Think more thoughts of abundance than of lack, and you have tipped the balance.

> The shortcut to anything you want in your life is to BE and FEEL happy now! It is the fastest way to bring money and anthing else you want into your life. Focus on radiating out into the Universe those feelings of joy and happiness. When you do that, you will attract back to you all things that bring you joy and happiness, which will not only include an abundance of money, but everything else you are wanting. You must raidate out the signal to bring back what you want. As you radiate out those feelings of happiness, they will be sent back to you as the pictures and experiences of your life. The law of attraction is reflecting back your innermost thoughts and feelings as your life.

### Focus on Prosperity

一千万，that would be great and enough.

Life is nothing more than a mind game.

> I grep up on, "You have to work hard for money." So I replaced that with, "Money comes easily and frequently." Now in the beginning it feels like a lie, right? There is a part of your brain that will say, "Oh you liar, it's hard." So you have to know it's this little tennis match that will go on for a while.

> When it comes to creating wealth, wealth is a mindset. It's all about how you think.

> Start to say and *feel*, "I have more than enough." "There is an abundance of money and it's on its way to me." "I am a money magnet." "I love money and money loves me." "I am receiving money every day." "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

### Give Money to Get Money

> Giving is a powerful action to bring more money into your life, because when you are giving you are asying, "I have plenty." It will not be surprising to you to learn that the wealthiest people on the planet are the greatest philanthropists. They give away vast amount of money, and as they give, by the law of attraction, the Universe opens up and floods vast amounts of money back to them - multiplied!

> There is a big difference between giving and sacrificig. Giving from a heart that is overflowing feels so good. Sacrificing does not feel good. Don't confuse the two - they are diametrically opposed. One emits a signal of lack and the other emits a signal of more-than-enough. One feels good and one does not feel good. Sacrifice will eventually lead to resentment. Giving from a full heart is one of the most joyous things you can do, and the law of attraction will grab hold of that signal and flood even more into your life. You can *feel* the difference.

对于时间也是同理，在加班时候如果感到sacrifice就表示意识中感到自己的时间正在被损耗，被“I don't have enough time”占据，如果感到的是giving，想着“I have more than enough time to give, and the extra working only takes this small amount of time that doesn't even matter”, I won't stop feeling good then.

> You are the heir to the kingdom. Prosperity is your birthright, and you hold the key to more abundance - in every area of your life - than you can possibly imagine. **You deserve every good thing you want**, and the Universe will give you every good thing you want, but you have to summon it into your life. Now you know The Secret. You have the key. The key is your thoughts and feelings, and you have been holding the key in your hand all of your life.

I am the heir to the Universe. Everything in the Universe, it's mine.

### Summary

> - To attract money, focus on wealth. It is impossible to bring more money into your life when you focus on the lack of it.
> - It is helpful to use your imagination and make-believe you already have the money you want. Play games of having wealth and you will feel better about money; as you feel better about it, more will flow into your life.
> - Feeling happy now is the fastest way to bring money into your life.
> - Make it your intention to look at everything you like and say to yourself, "I can afford that. I can buy that." You will shift your thinking and begin to feel better about money.
> - Give money in order to bring more of it into your life. When you are generous with money and feel good about sharing it, you are saying, "I have plenty."
> - Visualize checks in the mail.
> - Tip the balance of your thoughts to wealth. Think wealth.

## The Secret to Relationships

> Think about what you have asked for, and make sure that your actions are mirroring what you expect to receive, and that they're not contradicting what you've asked for. Act as if you are receiving it. Do exactly what you would do if you were receiving it today, and take actions in your life to reflect that powerful expectation. Make room to receive your desires, and as you do, you are sending out that powerful signal of expectation.

### Your Job is You

> How can you ever expect anyone else to enjoy your company if you don't enjoy your own company? And so again, the law of attraction or The Secret is about bring that into your life. You've got to get really, really clear. Here's the question I would ask you to consider: **<u>Do you treat yourself the way you want other people to treat you?</u>**

> When you do not treat yourself the way you want others to treat you, you can never change the way things are. Your actions are your powerful thoughts, so if you do not treat yourself with love and respect, you are emitting a signal that is saying you are not important enough, worthy enough, or deserving.

> To acquire love... fill yourself up with it until you become a magnet.

> You must change your focus and begin to think about all the things that are wonderful about You. Look for the positives in You. As you focus on those things, the law of attraction will show you more great things about You. You attract what you think about. All you have to do is begin with one prolonged thought of something good about You, and the law of attraction will respond by giving You more *like* thoughts. Look for the good things about You. Seek and you shall find!

> Even if you're having a really hard time in a relationship - things aren't working, you're not getting along, someone's in your face - you still can turn that relationship around. Take a piece of paper, and for the next thirty days sit down and write all the things that you appreciate about that person. Think about all the reasons that you love them. You appreciate their sense of humor, you appreciate how supportive they are. And what you'll find is that when you focus on appreciating the acknowledging their strengths, that's what you'll get more of, and the problems will fade away.

> Your ability to generate feelings of love is unlimited, and when you love you are in complete and utter harmony with the Universe. Love everything you can. Love everyone you can. Focus only on things you love, feel love, and you will experience that love and joy coming back to you - multiplied! The law of attraction must send you back more things to love. As you radiate love, it will appear as though the entire Universe is doing everything for you, moving every joyful thing to you, and moving every good person to you. In truth, it is.

### Summary

> - When you want to attract a relationship, make sure your thoughts, words, actions, and surroundings don't contradict your desires.
> - Your job is you. Unless you fill yourself up first, you have nothing to give anybody.
> - Treat yourself with love and respect, and you will attract people who show you love and respect.
> - When you feel bad about yourself, you block the love and instead you attract more people and situations that will continue to make you feel bad about you.
> - Focus on the qualities you love about yourself and the law of attraction will show you more great things about you.
> - To make a relationship work, focus on what you appreciate about the other person, and not your complaints. When you focus on the strengths, you will get more of them.

## The Secret to Health

Why does the excessive work tires me up? Because I believed the excessive work would exhaust me. To fix it, to make myself not exhausted or tired, I just have to believe that amount of work wouldn't exhaust me out. I can be energetic and atheletic after a day's work, and have more than enough energy to do things I want and make sure I can exercise and write and read and well-rested. If I can believe it, I shall have it. I know it's true.

> We've got a thousand different diagnoses and diseases out there. They're just the weak link. They're all the result of one thing: stress. If you put enough stress on the chain and you put enough stress on the system, then one of the links breaks.

### Laughter is the Best Medicine

> The power of gratitude to heal, the power of faith to receive, and the power of laughter and joy to dissolve disease in our bodies.

### Think Thoughts of Perfection

> I banished every bit of stiffness and lack of agility right out of my body. I focused on seeing my body as flexible and as perfect as a child's, and every stiff and aching joint vanished. I literally did this overnight.
>
> You can see that beliefs about aging are all in our minds. Science explains that we have a brand new body in a very short time. Aging is limited thinking, so release those thoughts from your consciousness and know that your body is only months old, no matter how many birthdays you have chalked up in your mind. For your next birthday, do yourself a favor and celebrate it as your first birthday! Don't cover your cake with sixty candles, unless you want to summon aging to you. Unfortunately, Western society has become fixated on age, and in reality there is no such thing.
>
> You can *think* your way to the perfect state of health, the perfect body, the perfect weight, and eternal youth. You can bring it into being, through your consistent thinking of perfection.

My body is stiff and aching and sore because I think it is aging. Now think of it as young and fresh as a child's.

> No matter what you have manifested in regards to your body, you can change it - inside and out. Start thinking happy thoughts and start *being* happy. Happiness is a *feeling* state of being. You have your finger on the "feeling happy" button. Press it now and keep your finger pressed down on it firmly, no matter what is happening around you.

### Nothing is Incurable

If the miracle could happen, and had happened, why can't it happen to you?

### Summary

> - The placebo effect is an example of the law of attraction in action. When a patient truly believes the tablet is a cure, he receives what he believes and is cured.
> - "Focusing on perfect health" is something we can all do within ourselves, despite what may be happening on the outside.
> - Laughter attracts joy, releases negativity, and leads to miraculous cures.
> - Disease is helf in the body by thought, by observation of the illness, and by the attention given to the illness. If you are feeling a little unwell, don't talk about it - unless you want more of it. If you listen to people talk about thier illness, you add energy to their illness. Instead, change the conversation to good things, and give powerful thoughts to seeing those peole in health.
> - Beliefs about aging are all in our minds, so release those thoughts from your consciousness. Focus on health and eternal youth.
> - Do not listen to society's messages about diseases and aging. Negative messages do not serve you.

又想开始试验吸引力法则了。不去想象一根羽毛，我想要两盒Macy's的巧克力，一盒全是酒心的，另一盒是各种莓类和水果味，为了让我知道这是宇宙给我的，我想要它们的透明塑料盒上都画一个巨大的笑脸，用蓝色的笔。我相信它们放在我冰箱的最下层，我会在每天晚饭时都吃半条，是很喜欢的味道了。我想要Royce家的生巧，所有口味各一盒，也呆在我冰箱的最下层，是每天的快乐来源。

## The Secret to the World

> What you resist persists.

> When the pictures have appeared of something you do not want, it is your cue to change your thinking and emit a new signal. If it is a world situation, you are not powerless. You have *all* the power. Focus on everybody being in joy. Focus on abundance of food. Give your powerful thoughts to what is wanted. You have the ability to give so much to the world by emitting feelings of love and well-being, despite what is happening around you.

> It's not your job to change the world, or the people around you. It's your job to go with the flow inside of the Universe, and to celebrate it inside the world that exists.

### The Universe is Abundant

> The truth is that there's more than enough good to go around. There's more than enough creative ideas. There's more than enough power. There's more than enough love. There's more than enough joy. All of this begins to come through a mind that is aware of its own infinite nature.

### Summary

> - What you resist, you attract, because you are powerfully focused on it with emotion. To change anything, go within and emit a new signal with your thoughts and feelings.
> - You cannot help the world by focusing on the negative things. As you focus on the world's negative events, you not only add to them, but you also bring more negative things into your own life.
> - Instead of focusing on the world's problems, give your attention and energy to trust, love, abundance, education, and peace.
> - We will never run out of good things because there's more than enough to go around for everyone. Life is meant to be abundant.
> - You have the ability to tap into the unlimited supply through your thoughts and feelings and bring it into your experience.
> - Praise and bless everything in the world, and you will dissolve negativity and discord and align yourself with the highest frequency - love.

## The Secret to You

> Everything is made up of the exact same thing, whether it's your hand, the ocean, or a star.

> Most people define themselves by this finite body, but you're not a finite body. Even under a microscope you're an energy field. What we know about energy is this: You go to a quantum physicist and you say, "What creates the world?" And he or she will say, "Energy." Well, describe energy.
>
> "Ok, it can never be created or destroyed, it always was, always has been, everything that ever existed always exists, it's moving into form, through form and out of form."
>
> You go to a theologian and ask the question, "What created the Universe?" And he or she will say, "God." OK, describe God.
>
> "Always was and always has been, never can be created or destroyed, all that ever was always will be, alwasy moving into form, through form and out of form."
>
> You see, it's the same description, just different terminology.
>
> So if you think you're this "meat suit" running around, think again. You're a spiritual being! You're an energy field, operating in a larger energy field.

I'm more than my body.

### The One Universal Mind

> So depending upon how we use that power, positively or negatively, that's the kind of body in terms of health, that's the kind of environment we create. So we are the creators, not only of our own destiny, but ultimately we are the creators of Universal destiny. We are the creators of the Universe.

We are the creators of the Universe.

> You are eternal life. You are God manifested in human form, made to perfection.

> We are another way that the Universe is becoming conscious of itself.

> You are God in a physical body. You are Spirit in the flesh. You are Eternal Life expressing itself as You. You are a cosmic being. You are all power. You are all wisdom. You are all intelligence. You are perfection. You are magnigicence. You are the creator, and you are creating the creation of You on this planet.

### You Are Not Your Past

> You are the designer of your destiny. You are the author. You write the story. The pen is in your hand, and the outcome is whatever you choose.

> "I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious, and happy."

> See what you want as absolute *fact*.

### Be Aware of Your Thoughts

> How do you become more aware? One way is to *stop* and ask yourself, "What am I thinking now? What am I feeling now?" The moment you ask you are aware, because you have brought your mind back to the present moment.

> To help myself become more aware, so I would *remember to remember*, I asked the Universes to give me a *gentle* nudge to bring me back to the present whenever my mind has taken over and is "having a party" at my expense. That gentle nudge happens by me bumping myself or dropping something, a loud noise, or a siren or an alarm going off. All of these things are signals to me that my mind has taken off, and to come back to the present. When I receive these signals I stop immediately and ask myself, "What am I thinking? What am I feeling? Am I aware?" And of course in the moment I do that, I am aware. The very moment you ask yourself if you aware, you are there. You are aware.

> The catch is, to transmit the highest frequency of love, you must love yourself, and that can be difficult for many. If you focus on the outside and what you see now, you may trip yourself up, because what you see and feel about you now is the result of what you *used* to think. If you don't love you, the person you see now is likely to be full of faults that you have found in yourself.
>
> To love yourself fully, you must focus on a new dimension of You. **<u>You must focus on the *presence* inside of You.</u>** Take a moment and sit still. Focus on feeling the *life presence* inside you. As you focus on the *presence* within, it will begin to reveal itself to You. It is a feeling of pure love and bliss, and it is perfection. The *presence* is the perfection of You. That *presence* is the *real* You. As you focus on that presence, as you feel, love, and praise that presence, you will love yourself fully, quite possibly for the first time in your life.
>
> Any time you look at yourself with critical eyes, switch your focus immediately to the *presence* within, and its perfection will reveal itself to You.

> The absolute truth is that the "I" is perfect and complete; the real "I" is spiritual and can therefore never be less than perfect; it can never have any lack, limitation, or disease.

### Summary

> - Everything is energy. You are an energy magnet, so you electrically energize everything to you and electrically energize yourself to everything you want.
> - You are a spiritual being. You are energy, and energy cannot be created or destroyed - it just changes form. Therefore, the pure essence of you has always been and always will be.
> - The Universe emerges from thought. We are the creators not only of our own destiny but also of the Universe.
> - An unlimited supply of ideas is available to you. All knowledge, discoveries, and inventions are in the Universal Mind as possibilities, waiting for the human mind to draw them forth. You hold everything in your consciousness.
> - We are all connected, and we are all One.
> - Let go of difficulties from your past, cultural codes, and social beliefs. You are the only one who can create the life you deserve.
> - A shortcut to manifesting you desires is to see what you want as absolute fact.
> - Your power is in your thoughts, so stay aware. In other words, "Remember to remember."

## The Secret to Life

> Joy, love, freedom, happiness, laughter. That's what it is. And if you just experience joy sitting there and meditating for an hour, by golly, do that. If you experience joy eating a salami sandwich, then do that!

> Inner happiness actually is the fuel of success.

> Be happy *now*. Feel good *now*. That's the only thing you have to do. If that's the only thing you get from reading this book, then you have received the greatest part of The Secret.

### Embrace Your Magnificence

> See yourself with the good that you desire.

> The Secret is within you. The more you use the power within you, the more you will draw it to you. You will reach a point where you won't need to practice anymore, because you will Be the power, you will Be the perfection, you will Be the wisdom, you will Be the intelligence, you will Be the love, you will Be the joy.	

> The earth turns on its orbit for You. The oceans ebb and flow for You. The birds sing for You. The sun rises and it sets for You. The stars come out for You. Every beautiful thing you see, every wondrous thing you experience, is all there, for You. Take a look around. None of it can exist, without You. No matter who you thought you were, now you know the Truth of Who You Really Are. You are the master of the Universe. You are the heir to the kingdom. You are the perfection of Life. And now you know The Secret.

### Summary

> - You get to fill the blackboard of your life with whatever you want.
> - The only thing you need to do is *feel good now*.
> - The more you use the power within you, the more power you will draw through you.
> - The time to embrace your maginicence is now.
> - We are in the midst of a glorious era. As we let go of limiting thoughts, we will experience humanity's true magnificence, in every area of creation.
> - Do what you love. If you don't know what brings you joy, ask, "What is my joy?" As you commit to your joy, you will attract an avalanche of joyful things because you are radiating joy.
