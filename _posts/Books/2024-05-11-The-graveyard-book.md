Reading Neil Gaiman's works -- especially longer novels -- are like riding a long road trip with him, and he never warn you about the road bumps ahead of time, but also never spoil the surprising, beautiful, astonishing views outside of the window. This story is one of those many road trips (just like so many of his other novels), and it's a fun piece to read, as usual.

算是很有意思的一本小说，很容易读，也一如既往地保持了盖曼一贯水准的想象力，不过也仍然不会把这本称作是他最好的作品（或许因为总是会expect more of him？）。主角小孩的年龄决定了这本故事就像《Coraline》和《Ocean at the End of the Lane》一样基本属于targeting给孩子的故事，如果没记错的话这本故事最初开始创作的契机也只是给他的孩子讲个故事，然后这个随口开始讲的故事越来越长，大家都想知道之后又发生了什么，于是就这样写下去了。感觉也是因为这样所以整个故事的结构性其实不算很强，很多章节感觉可以单独取出来而不影响主线剧情，尤其比如Dance of Macabray那一章，but I like it，甚至可以算是尤其精彩的部分，所以在增加故事趣味性上还是很有作用的。就好像有点像是《Stardust》里他们兜兜转转绕远路回家的路，作者确实可以让他们少绕些路就直接回到了家，但这样的road trip就要少很多趣味了，the sightseeing部分也仍然count to the whole experience，所以let's just keep them as they are。

以为作为“graveyard”故事，会免不了讨论很多关于生死的话题，会偶尔忍不住深刻哲理起来，但其实并没有很多。Bod lives among the dead，所以反而对生死这件事看得淡极了，“I'll die? So what? Most of my friends are already dead”的那种态度，反而还需要Silas还教他being alive的好处和重要性。

越读越喜欢Silas，智慧而强大的guardian角色，一定程度上有点像AD了，哲理的道理和建议几乎总是他提出的。neither alive nor dead的行走在边缘上的边缘守护者身份也是神秘又美丽，让人忍不住想要继续挖掘他的故事，想象他的过去和未来，感到还有更多的故事可以从他身上衍生出来。如果哪一天盖曼想要续写这本故事了（虽然很怀疑这一点，but who knows），感到最有可能的就是从Silas开始写呢。或者如果我要写一点什么衍生的话，几乎肯定是Silas的周边同人了。希望他不会介意，但是我好像真的相当喜爱他。

于是在看完整本之后也又重新从头翻阅了一遍，刻意地去找Silas每一次出现的场景，也是又挖掘出了很多之前没有注意到的Silas无意提及的关于自己的故事，了解得越多也越感到他的神秘，吊起更多的兴趣了。（最感兴趣的片段都摘在后面了。）

感觉似乎发现了一个盖曼执着热爱的彩蛋：已经是第三次从他的小说里看见一个姓氏是Hempstock的女巫了（前两次是《Ocean at the End of the Lane》和《Stardust》），忍不住想这个从小一起长大的好朋友好邻居的姓氏到底给他留下了多深的印象啊。或许那家人真的是巫师？或许他的故事里的每一个Hempstock都remotely related，所以所有故事说不定就是发生在同一个宇宙里的？“盖曼宇宙”。

但或许这本书真的不太适合一边在看Supernatural的时候一边看……习惯了SPN里关于ghost的思维方式之后在这里又见到了，下意识的反应就会变成想到如果在他们的墓穴里撒上盐再点火这些ghost就会消失了……这里也有ghoul也有狼人，于是总有种奇怪的感觉好像读着读着Winchesters就会开着impala赶到现场开始驱鬼了x

<br>

几乎每一次都会被盖曼写的各种咒语、召唤词、歌词吸引到，那些平时明明普通的字句被他用特定的方式结合起来再写下来，感觉好像真的有了魔力，于是忍不住都想摘记下来，把自己的这方空间也变得好像充满魔法了：

> Abanazer Bolger picked up the card again, by the edge, and waved it back and forth, slowly, as if running the edge along an imaginary flame. "<u>Here comes a candle to light you to bed...</u>" he began.
>
> "<u>... and here comes a chopper to chop off your head</u>," concluded Tom Hustings, thoughtfully.
>
> ——Chapter Four - *The Witch's Headstone*

对the man Jack的召唤词：感觉中间似乎被跳过了一些更加黑暗的字句呢，但是光是这一头一尾就已经足够感到黑暗了。

> The she said, "What do you do, when you try to Fade?"
>
> "What Mr. Pennyworth told me. *<u>'I am an empty doorway, I am a vacant alley, I am nothing. Eyes will not see me, glances slip over me.'</u>* But it never works."
>
> ——Chapter Four - *The Witch's Headstone*

关于如何学会Fade的教诲：好有意思，空走廊、空巷，“我是虚无”，“目光会从我身上滑过”，光是这样描述就仿佛已经想象到了真正做到Fade的样子（当然后面Bod真的做到了之后也有更多关于他的“不存在”的很有趣的描写，但限于篇幅就不都摘抄下来了）。在头脑里念诵这几句教诲，好像感觉自己的身形也变得稍微更加缥缈虚无一点了。

> And with that, she began to mutter to herself, mumbling words that Bod could not make out. Then she said, clear and loud,
>
> <u>*"Be hole, be dust, be dream, be wind,*</u>
>
> <u>*Be night, be dark, be wish, be mind,*</u>
>
> <u>*Now slip, now slide, now move unseen,*</u>
>
> <u>*Above, beneath, betwixt, between."*</u>
>
> Something huge touched him, brushed him from head to feet, and he shivered. His hair pickled, and his skin was all gooseflesh. Something had changed.
>
> ——Chapter Four - *The Witch's Headstone*

女巫的咒语：非常朗朗上口呢，也是很有魔力的感觉。每次都会为这种不知怎么做到的、光是把特定词句排列在一起就让人感觉好像有魔法的做法着迷。

> *Rich man, poor man, come away.*
>
> *Come to dance the Macabray.*
>
> *Time to work and time to play,*
>
> *Time to dance the Macabray.*
>
> *One and all will hear and stay*
>
> *Come and dance the Macabray.*
>
> *One to leave and one to stay*
>
> *And all to dance the Macabray.*
>
> *Now the Lady on the Grey*
>
> *Leads us in the Macabray.*
>
> ——Chapter Five - *Danse Macabre*

关于Macabray的歌谣：查了才知道“Danse Macabre”是法语，意思就是“Dance of Death”，但在故事里，比纯粹的死之舞更有意思的是现在变成了the dance between the living and the dead。This is the only time the living and the dead could mingle together, dance the whole night, led by the Lady on the Grey. 一开始甚至还没有反应过来压轴出场的气质充满威压的这位the Lady on the Grey就是Death herself，因为想象的画面里和睡魔的死神姐姐还有SPN最近越来越熟稔的死神老爷子都是很不一样的感觉呢。

> Sleep my little baby,
>
> Sleep until you waken
>
> When you wake you'll see the world
>
> If I'm not mistaken.
>
> <br>
>
> Kiss a lover
>
> Dance a measure,
>
> Find your name
>
> And buried treasure...
>
> <br>
>
> Face your life
>
> Its pain, its pleasure,
>
> Leave no path untaken.
>
> ——Chapter Eight - *Leavings and Partings*

Mrs. Owens的摇篮曲：在第一章就给baby Bod唱过，在最后一章告别时又唱了完整的一遍，加上了最后一个小节，从写作角度看真是很首尾呼应的设计了。

<br>

About Silas:

> He did not expect what he actually heard, a voice, silky smooth, saying,
>
> "Can I help you?"
>
> The man Jack was tall. This man was taller. The man Jack wore dark clothes. This man's clothes were darker. People who noticed the man Jack when he was about his business -- and he did not like to be noticed -- were troubled, or made uncomfortable, or found themselves unaccountably scared. The man Jack looked up at the stranger, and it was the man Jack who was troubled.
>
> ——Chapter One - *How Nobody Came to the Graveyard*

“silky smooth voice”, dark, uncomfortable, make the man Jack troubled，第一次看的时候还不知道这位陌生人就是Silas，等到之后出现名字的时候恐怕又已经把出场的这种压迫性气质忘得差不多了。要是改成剧的话或许就会印象更深刻得多。这么多的侧面烘托，每一个特质都用本来已经足够让人害怕的the man Jack作为了比较对象，然后他只会更加可怕，更加黑暗，更加神秘。就像剧作课教过的，对比，通过周围人的反应作为镜子来侧面描写和烘托，简直没有比这更快塑造一个人的方式了。

> "I can't give him up. Not after what I promised his mama."
>
> "Although I have been a great many things in my time," said Silas, "I have never been a mother. And I do not plan to begin now. But I *can* leave this place..."
>
> Mrs. Owens said simply, "I cannot. My bones are here. And so are Owens's. I'm never leaving."
>
> <u>"It must be good," said Silas, "to have somewhere you belong. Somewhere that's home."</u> There was nothing wistful in the way he said this. His voice was drier than deserts, and he said it as if he were simply stating something unarguable. Mrs. Owens did not argue.
>
> ——Chapter One - *How Nobody Came to the Graveyard*

“It must be good to have somewhere that's home”，听起来相当悲伤的一句话，但又为什么毫不wistful？毫无怀念，毫无渴望，毫无伤感，好像他只是说出这样一个事实但并不真实对这句话有什么理解？因为他从来没有过家，所以根本不知道也不想知道有一个归处是什么感觉？还是他早就确定自己这样的存在根本不可能有家，于是早就已经遗忘和放弃了“家”的概念？但是经过了这十年，有个小孩子昼夜地生活在他身边，依恋于他的屋檐衣襟庇护之下，总是仰慕他，崇敬他，他难道不会把他当做家人、把这里当做家吗？没有home、没有family，大概也没有朋友，这听起来实在有些太孤独了。

> Silas had brought Bod food, true, and left it in the crypt each night for him to eat, but this was, as far as Bod was concerned, the least of the things that Silas did for him. He gave advice, cool, sensible, and unfailingly correct; he knew more than the graveyard folks did, for his nightly excursions into the world outside meant that he was able to describe a world that was current, not hundreds of years out of date; he was unflappable and dependable, had been there every night of Bod's life, so the idea of the little chapel without its own inhabitant was one that Bod found difficult to conceive of; <u>most of all, he made Bod feel safe.</u>
>
> ——Chapter Three - *The Hounds of God*

不止是Bod会feel safe，光是读着那些文字，Silas甚至让我也感到safe了呢。实在非常让人有安全感的存在了。

> "So the people buried in the ground on the other side of the fence are bad people?"
>
> Silas raised one perfect eyebrow. "Mm? Oh, not at all. Let's see, it's been a while since I've been down that way. But I don't remember anyone particularly evil. Remember, in days gone by you could be handed for stealing a shilling. And there are always people who find their lives have become so unsupportable they believe the best thing they could do would be to hasten their transition to another plane of existence."
>
> "They kill themselves, you mean?" said Bod. He was about eight years old, wide-eyed and inquisitive, and he was not stupid.
>
> "Indeed."
>
> "Does it work? Are they happier dead?"
>
> "Sometimes. Mostly, no. <u>It's like the people who believe they'll be happy if they go and live somewhere else, but who learn it doesn't work that way. Wherever you go, you take yourself with you.</u> If you see what I mean."
>
> ——Chapter Four - *The Witch's Headstone*

关于自杀的讨论：终于还是出现一些稍微有点深刻的讨论了。Silas的回答也是很有启示性的：想要靠自杀让自己来到另一片plane of existence只因他们幻想和期盼那另一个地方会让他们过得更好些，这跟那些想要靠搬家来改善自己生活的人没什么区别，but it doesn't work that way。后面这句说得实在太好了：“Wherever you go, you take yourself with you”，而这个yourself，就连死亡也无法分开的。所以不要再想着靠死亡来解决什么问题或者逃避你自己了，it wouldn't work。Just face yourself and work with it, that's the only way.

> "Silas. What's a Macabray?"
>
> Silas's eyebrows raised and his head tipped to one side. "Where did you hear about that?"
>
> "Everyone in the graveyard is talking about it. I think it's something that happens tomorrow night. What's a Macabray?"
>
> "It's a dance," said Silas.
>
> "*All must dance the Macabray*," said Bod, remembering. "Have you danced it? What kind of dance is it?"
>
> His guardian looked at him with eyes like black pools and said, "I do not know. I know many things, Bod, for I have been walking this earth at night for a very long time, but I do not know what it is like to dance the Macabray. <u>You must be alive or you must be dead to dance it -- and I am neither.</u>"
>
> Bod shivered. He wanted to embrace his guardian, to hold him and tell him that he would never desert him, but the action was unthinkable. He could no more hug Silas than he could hold a moonbeam, not because his guardian was insubstantial, but because it would be wrong. There were people you could hug, and then there were Silas.
>
> ——Chapter Five - *Danse Macabre*

Neither alive nor dead，仍然很难想象这到底是一种什么样的存在状态，但似乎对于Silas来说又是很自然的——这样一种强大的让人充满安全感的存在，本来就应该是站在生死界线上的，所以才会这样强大，所以才会对帷幕两边都拥有充分的了解。但……他也因此无法收到舞会的邀请函了。

> *Everyone*, thought Bod, *everyone is dancing!* He thought it, and as soon as he thought it he realized that he was mistaken. In the shadows by the Old Town Hall, a man was standing, dressed all in black. He was not dancing. He was watching them.
>
> <u>Bod wondered if it was longing that he saw on Silas's face, or sorrow, or something else, but his guardian's face was unreadable.</u>
>
> He called out, "Silas!" hoping to make his guardian come to them, to join the dance, to have the fun they were having, but when he heard his name, Silas stepped back into the shadows and was lost to sight.
>
> ——Chapter Five - *Danse Macabre*

Silas的神情几乎永远是用unreadable在描写，所以他到底在想什么呢？渴望，还是悲伤，还是更多的什么？真的很想打开这个从来不肯打开自己的人，看看他的心墙里到底藏了多少东西。

> Silas said, "You know you're different. That you are alive. That we took you in -- *they* took you in here -- and that I agreed to be your guardian."
>
> Bod said nothing.
>
> Silas continued, in his voice like velvet, "You had parents. An older sister. They were killed. I believe that you were to have been killed as well, and that you were not was due to chance, and the intervention of the Owenses."
>
> "And you," said Bod, who had had that night described to him over the years by many people, some of whom had even been there. It had been a big night in the graveyard.
>
> Silas said, "Out there, the man who killed your family is, I believe, still looking for you, still intends to kill you."
>
> Bod shrugged. "So?" he said, "It's only death. I mean, all of my best friends are dead."
>
> "Yes." Silas hesitated. "They are. And they are, for the most part, done with the world. You are not. <u>You're *alive*, Bod. That means you have infinite potential. You can do anything, make anything, dream anything. If you change the world, the world will change. Potential. Once you're dead, it's gone. Over. You've made what you've made, dreamed your dream, written your name. You may be buried here, you may even walk. But that potential is finished.</u>"
>
> Bod thought about this. It seemed almost true, although he could think of exceptions -- his parents adopting him, for example. But the dead and the living were different, he knew that, even if his sympathies were with the dead.
>
> "What about you?" he asked Silas.
>
> "What about me?"
>
> "Well, you aren't alive. And you go around and do things."
>
> <u>"I," said Silas, "am precisely what I am, and nothing more. I am, as you say, not alive. But if I am ended, I shall simply cease to be.</u> <u>My kind *are*, or we are *not*.</u> If you see what I mean."
>
> ——Chapter Six - *Nobody Owens's School Days*

关于活着的意义：It's all about potential。当你活着的时候，你可以改变这个世界，你可以改变自己的决定，可以去做各种事，可以在这个世界上留下各种痕迹，而当你死了的时候——哪怕还有鬼魂幽灵——那些改变和痕迹都停止了，you are done with the world。想起了以前看过的一个很接近的表达：生的意义在于你能做出的动作，比如如果你是一个花匠，那么你种过花，而当你死了，那些花不再会因为你的存在而变得不同；如果你是雕塑家，你雕过艺术品，那些雕塑因你的存在而改变，而在你死后这些改变会留存下来，但不会有更多了；而相对于对物质世界的改变而言，一个人在另一个人身上形成的影响，那才是最深刻而难忘的。So don't look down on the life, don't waste it or give it up -- go out there, dream your dream, do something, anything, make things, experience everything, live the life, because there will be no more life after the death.

也很喜欢Silas说的对自己的存在的解释：“My kind *are*, or we are *not*.”很喜欢这句话，几乎比得上对《Stardust》里那句“nowness”和“skyness”的喜爱了。用极简单的字句传达出来的意思，需要认真去理解他的含义，但是理解了之后会感到，再没有比这更准确的遣词造句了。极简单的词，“are”和“not”，只是加了斜体，于是会去认真揣摩，于是词的含义深刻地传输过来了。“他存在，或者停止存在”，他没有生或者死，如果他被终结了，那么他就停止存在了。而抹掉存在，这是一个比死亡更强大和严重得多的后果，他的终结，就好像是他从未存在过。那是怎样的一种比死亡更悲伤的结束啊。（又很想扩充地去想象他的故事了。）

> "I cannot believe," said Silas, "that you could have been so... so stupid. Everything I told you about remaining just this side of invisibility. And now you've become the talk of the school?"
>
> "Well, what did you want me to do?"
>
> "Not this," said Silas. "It's not like the olden times. They can keep track of you, Bod. They can find you." <u>Silas's unmoving exterior was like the hard crust of rock over molten lava. Bod knew how angry Silas was only because he knew Silas. He seemed to be fighting his anger, controlling it.</u>
>
> Bod swallowed.
>
> "What should I do?" he said, simply.
>
> "Don't go back," said Silas. "This school business was an experiment. Let us simply acknowledge that it was not a successful one."
>
> Bod said nothing. Then he said, "It's not just the learning stuff. It's the other stuff. Do you know how nice it is to be in a room filled with people and for all of them to be breathing?"
>
> "It's not something in which I've ever taken pleasure," said Silas. "So. You don't go back to school tomorrow."
>
> "I'm *not* running away. Not from Mo or Nick or school. I'd leave here first."
>
> "You will do as you are told, boy," said Silas, a knot of velvet anger in the darkness.
>
> "Or what?" said Bod, his cheeks burning. "What would you do to keep me here? *Kill me?*" And he turned on his heel and began to walk down the path that led to the gates and out of the graveyard.
>
> Silas began to call the boy back, then he stopped, and stood there in the night alone.
>
> <u>At the best of times his face was unreadable. Now his face was a book written in a language long forgotten, in an alphabet unimagine.</u> Silas wrapped the shadows around him like a blanket, and stared after the way the boy had gone, and did not move to follow.
>
> ——Chapter Six - *Nobody Owens's School Days*

关于Silas的神情动作描写总是很克制，最多的动作不过是抬眉挑眉，到了这里终于开始出现愤怒（虽然仍然是非常克制的愤怒），也越来越像个人类、像个监护人、像个父亲了。

> Then the police car turned a corner, and there was a *thump!* Something big rode up onto the hood of the car and was knocked off into the dark.
>
> He leaned over as far as he could, craning to try and see what had happened, what was on the road.
>
> Bod looked at the face of the fallen body -- then he began to bang on the window, frantically, desperately.
>
> "<u>You hit my -- my dad</u>," said Bod.
>
> Silas was sprawled on his back, on the ground, where the car had knocked him. He was deathly still.
>
> Bod's eyes prickled.
>
> He said, "Dad?" Then he said, "You killed him." He wasn't lying, he told himself -- not really.
>
> Bod crouched by Silas, and he squeezed Silas's cold hand in his. If they had already called an ambulance there was not much time.
>
> Bod whispered, "They aren't looking. Now." And he Faded.
>
> There was a swirl of deeper darkness, and the body on the ground was not standing beside him.
>
> Silas said, "I'll take you home. Put your arms around my neck."
>
> Bod did, holding tightly to his guardian, and they plunged through the night, heading for the graveyard.
>
> "I'm sorry," said Bod.
>
> "I'm sorry too," said Silas.
>
> "<u>Did it hurt?</u>" asked Bod. "Letting the car hit you like that?"
>
> "Yes," said Silas. "You should thank your little witch-friend. She came and found me, told me you were in trouble, and what kind of trouble you were in."
>
> They landed in the graveyard. Bod looked at his home as if it was the first time he had ever seen it.
>
> ...
>
> The boy and his guardian stood at the top of the hill, looking out at the lights of the town.
>
> "<u>Does it still hurt?</u>" asked the boy.
>
> "A little," said his guardian. "But I heal fast. I'll soon be as good as ever."
>
> "Could it have killed you? Stepping out in front of that car?"
>
> His guardian shook his head. <u>"There are ways to kill people like me," he said. "But they don't involve cars. I am very old and very tough."</u>
>
> Bod said, "I *was* wrong, wasn't I? The whole idea was to do it without anybody noticing. And then I had to get involved with the kids in the school, and the next thing you know, there's police and all sorts of stuff. Because I was selfish."
>
> Silas raised an eyebrow. "You weren't selfish. You need to be among your own kind. Quite understandable. It's just harder out there in the world of the living, and we cannot protect you out there as easily. I wanted to keep you perfectly safe," said Silas. "But there is only one perfectly safe place for your kind and you will not reach it until all your adventures are over and none of them matter any longer."
>
> ——Chapter Six - *Nobody Owens's School Days*

好喜欢这一整个部分的剧情，好几页的对话和故事，很不容易地只截出来跟Silas有关的片段：为了救小孩直接跳出去让车撞，之前在冷战生气的两个人在这种危急时刻终于缓和了关系。小孩连着问了好几次“疼吗”，感觉无论多么生气的人都不可能接着生气了吧。

“very old and very tough”，很快的自愈能力，无法被汽车杀死但仍然有可能被杀死……所以能杀死他这样的存在的方法，到底会是什么样的呢？

> The steamer trunk was lined with whiteness. Bod put a hand into the empty trunk, touched the silk lining, touched dried earth.
>
> "Is this where you sleep?" he asked.
>
> "When I am far from my house, yes," said Silas.
>
> Bod was taken aback: Silas had been here as long as he could remember and before. "Isn't *this* your home?"
>
> Silas shook his head. "My house is a long, long way from here," said Silas. "That is, if it is still habitable. There have been problems in my native land, and I am far from certain what I will find on my return."
>
> "You're going back?" asked Bod. Things that had been immutable were changing. "You're really leaving? But. You're my guardian."
>
> "I *was* your guardian. But you are old enough to guard yourself. I have other things to protect."
>
> Silas closed the lid of the brown leather trunk, and began to do up the straps and the buckles.
>
> "Can't I stay here? In the graveyard?"
>
> "You must not," said Silas, more gently than Bod could remember him ever saying anything. "All the people here have had their lives, Bod, even if they were short ones. Now it's your turn. You need to live."
>
> "Can I come with you?"
>
> Silas shook his head.
>
> <u>"Will I see you again?"</u>
>
> "Perhaps." There was kindness in Silas's voice, and something more. "And whether you see me or not, I have no doubt that I will see you." He put the leather trunk against the wall, walked over to the door in the far corner. "Follow me." Bod walked behind Silas, followed him down the small spiral staircase to the crypt. "I took the liberty of packing a case for you," Silas explained, as they reached the bottom.
>
> On top of the box of mildewed hymn books was a small leather suitcase, a miniature twin to Silas's own. "Your possessions are all in there," said Silas.
>
> Bod said, "Tell me about the Honour Guard, Silas. You're in it. Miss Lupescu was. Who else? Are there a lot of you? What do you do?"
>
> "We don't do enough," said Silas. "And mostly, we guard the borderlands. We protect the borders of things."
>
> "What kind of borders?"
>
> Silas said nothing.
>
> "You mean like stopping the man Jack and his people?"
>
> Silas said, "We do what we have to." He sounded weary.
>
> "But you did the right thing. I mean, stopping the Jacks. They were terrible. They were monsters."
>
> Silas took a step closer to Bod, which made the youth tilt back his head to look up at the tall man's pale face. Silas said, <u>"I have not always done the right thing. When I was younger... I did worse things than Jack. Worse than any of them. I was the monster, then, Bod, and worse than any monster."</u>
>
> It did not even cross Bod's mind to wonder if his guardian was lying or joking. He knew that he was being told the truth. He said, "But you aren't that any longer, are you?"
>
> Silas said, "People can change," and then fell silent. Bod wondered if his guardian -- if Silas -- was remembering. Then, "It was an honor to be your guardian, young man." His hand vanished inside his cloak, reappeared holding a battered old wallet. "This is for you. Take it."
>
> Bod took the wallet, but did not open it.
>
> "It contains money. Enough to give you a start in the world, but nothing more."
>
> Bod said, "I went to see Alonso Jones today but he wasn't there, or if he was I couldn't see him. I wanted him to tell me about distant places he'd visited. Islands and porpoises and glaciers and mountains. Places where people dress and eat in the strangest ways." Bod hesitated. Then, "Those places. They're still there. I mean, there's a whole world out there. Can I see it? Can I go there?"
>
> Silas nodded. "There is a whole world out there, yes. You have a passport in the inner pocket of your suitcase. It's made out in the name of Nobody Owens. And was not easy to obtain."
>
> Bod said, "If I change my mind can I come back here?" And then he answered his own question. "If I come back, it will be a place, but it won't be home any longer."
>
> Silas said, "Would you like me to walk you to the front gate?"
>
> Bod shook his head. "Best if I do it on my own. Um. Silas. <u>If you're ever in trouble, call me. I'll come and help.</u>"
>
> "I," said Silas, "do not get into trouble."
>
> "No. I don't suppose you do. But still."
>
> It was  dark in the crypt, and it smelled of mildew and damp and old stones, and it seemed, for the first time, very small.
>
> Bod said, <u>"I want to see life. I want to hold it in my hands. I want to leave a footprint on the sand of a desert island. I want to play football with people. I want," he said, and then he paused and he thought. "I want *everything*."</u>
>
> "Good," said Silas. Then he put up his hand as if he were brushing away the hair from his eyes -- a most uncharacteristic gesture. He said, <u>"If ever it transpires that I am in trouble, I shall indeed send for you."</u>
>
> "Even though you don't get into trouble?"
>
> "As you say."
>
> There was something at the edge of Silas's lips that might have been a smile, and might have been regret, and might just have been a trick of the shadows.
>
> "Good-bye, then, Silas." Bod held out his hand, as he had when he was a small boy, and Silas took it, in a cold hand the color of old ivory, and shook it gravely.
>
> "Good-bye, Nobody Owens."
>
> ——Chapter Eight - *Leavings and Partings*

道别总是艰难的，但也是动人的。Silas提到自己的来处（和归处）总是用的是“house”而非“home”，而即使是house也或许早就失去了，又是一个没有根基的孤独的人啊，跟博士何曾相似。

“Will I see you again”，呜呜，为什么离别时的小孩总是会问出同样的句子。“我还会再见到你吗？”“你的心是怎么告诉你的？”，在这里Silas告诉他了：“你或许不一定还会再见到我，我一定还会再看见你的。”行走在生死界线上的守护者啊，当活的人迈过界线走到另一侧的时候，他总是会看见他们的。

关于Honour Guard，关于曾经的Silas，现在是这样令人崇敬的充满安全感的存在，过去究竟做过什么会让他用“worse than any monster”来形容自己？每一次以为可以了解他更多的时候，又总是会发现好像只是变成了更多的谜题。

“但你遇到麻烦的时候，来找我吧”“我不会遇到麻烦”“那也一样”“好”：好可爱，被完完全全可爱到了。Silas在这种分离的时刻也明显变得更加柔软宠溺了呢，gentler than usual，kindness in his voice。在有可能是最后一次见面的机会里，总还是要最后宠一次小孩的。

即将走进世界的小孩说想要去做什么，有太多太多想做的事，“I want everything”。忍不住想到了群里认识的朋友，刚刚毕业的时候充满兴奋和激情地冲过来说她想要做多少事，想要去看火山冰原极光大草原，想要去滑雪冲浪跳伞攀岩，所有的事，任何的事，好像整个世界都在面前展开，好像生命刚刚开始，大笑又大哭，对生命和世界充满了热爱。很触动很能共情这种感受了，好希望这样的激情能更持久地在这样的小孩身上保持住，因为这个成年人的世界，有一种能消磨这种激情的能力 。

“Good-bye, then, Silas”“Good-bye, Nobody Owens”，总有一种奇怪的错觉，好像远行的Silas是准备去登船，是听到了海的呼声，而他曾经的家在遥远的海的另一边，而准备出行的小孩，好像是第一次走出了霍比屯。从某种角度看，或许想得也不算差很远吧，魔戒和这个故事，也都是关于探索生命和世界的。但出行，即使看起来是很相似的动作，也可以代表极不同的含义：可能是离家、是走向世界，也可能是把世界抛在身后、是回家。

而Silas的家（他的房子、他的人民的土地）在他不在的时候究竟发生了什么、变成了什么样子，最先想到的是很可能会变成一片战争后的废土，那么这战争是如何开启的，双方又为什么开战，争了个输赢之后两方又去了哪里，还是几乎同归于尽，只剩下残局等着Silas回去收拾重整。真的还有太多太多的故事可以想，可以写，可以让Silas在我们的笔下故事里继续活跃，继续完成他的使命，继续走在生死的界线上当一名边界守护者。
