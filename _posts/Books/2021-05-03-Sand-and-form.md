仅仅在昨天，我认为我自己只是一个碎片，无韵律地在生命的苍穹中颤抖。

现在我明白，我就是那苍穹，一切生命都是在我里面有韵律地转动的碎片。

It was but yesterday I thought myself a fragment quivering without rhythm in the sphere of life.

Now I know that I am the sphere, and all life in rhythmic fragments moves within me.

他们在觉醒的时候对我说：“你和你所居住的世界，只不过是无边海洋的无边沙岸上的一粒沙子。”

在梦里我对他们说：“我就是那无边的海洋，大千世界只不过是我的沙岸上的沙粒。”

They say to me in their awakening, "You and the world you live in are but a grain of sand upon the infinite shore of an infinite sea."

And in my dream I say to them, "I am the infinite sea, and all worlds are but grains of sand upon my shore."

<br>

只有一次我哑口无言，就是当一个人问我“你是谁”的时候。

Only once have I been made mute. It was when a man asked me, "Who are you?"

<br>

The first thought of God was an angel.

The first word of God was a man.

<br>

斯芬克斯只说过一次话。斯芬克斯说：“一粒沙子就是一片沙漠，一片沙漠就是一粒沙子；现在再让我们沉默下去吧。”

The Sphinx spoke only once, and the Sphinx said, "A grain of sand is a desert, and a desert is a grain of sand; and now let us all be silent again."

<br>

我的房子对我说：“不要离开我，因为你的过去驻足在这里。”

而道路对我说：“跟我来吧，因为我是你的将来。”

我对我的房子和道路说：“我没有过去，也没有将来。如果我驻足，我的停留中有离去；如果我离开，我的离去中有停留。只有爱和死才能改变这所有一切。”

My house says to me, "Do not leave me, for here dwells your past."

And the road says to me, "Come and follow me, for I am your future."

And I say to both my house and the road, "I have no past, nor have I a future. If I stay here, there is a going in my staying; and if I go, there is a staying in my going. Only love and death will change all things."

<br>

我曾七次鄙视自己的灵魂：

第一次是在她可以上升而却谦让的时候。

第二次是我看见她在瘸者面前跛行的时候。

第三次是让她选择难易，而她选了易的时候。

第四次是她做错了事，却安慰自己说别人也同样做错了事。

第五次是她容忍了软弱，而把她的忍受称为坚强。

第六次是当她轻蔑一个丑恶的容颜的时候，却不知道那是她自己的面具中之一。

第七次是当她唱一首颂歌的时候，自己相信这是一种美德。

Seven times have I despised my soul:

The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height.

The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled.

The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy.

The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong.

The fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength.

The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks.

And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue.

<br>

人的幻想和成就之间的空隙只能由他的渴望来跨越。

There is a space between man's imagination and man's attainment that may only be traversed by his longing.

<br>

如果你真的睁起眼睛来看，你会从每一个形象中看到你自己的形象。

如果你张开耳朵来听，你会在一切声音里听到你自己的声音。

Should you really open your eyes and see, you would behold your image in all images.

And should you open your ears and listen, you would hear your own voice in all voices.

<br>

如果要我在“写诗的能力”和“未写成诗的欢乐”之间选择的话，我会选那欢乐。因为欢乐是更好的诗。

但是你和我所有的邻居，都一致地说我总是做出糟糕的选择。

If I were to choose between the power of writing a poem and the ecstasy of a poem unwritten, I would choose the ecstasy. It is better poetry.

But you and all my neighbors agree that I always choose badly.

<br>

诗人是一个退位的君王，坐在他的宫殿的灰烬里，想用残灰捏出一个形象。

A poet is a dethroned king sitting among the ashes of his palace trying to fashion an image out of the ashes.

<br>

他们说夜莺唱着恋歌的时候，把刺扎进自己的心膛。

我们也都是这样的。不然我们还能怎么歌唱？

They say the nightingale pierces his bosom with a thorn when he sings his love song.

So do we all. How else should we sing?

<br>

我和另外一个我，从来没有完全一致过。事物的真相似乎横亘在我们中间。

你的另外一个你总是为你难过。但是你的另外一个你就在难过中成长；于是一切都好了。

I have never agreed with my other self wholly. The truth of the matter seems to lie between us.

Your other self is always sorry for you. But your other self grows on sorrow; so all is well.

<br>

你生下来的那一天，魔鬼就死去了。

你不必经过地狱去会见天使。

The devil died the very day you were born.

Now you do not have to go through hell to meet an angel.

<br>

我的心，除了破碎，还能怎么打开呢？

How shall my heart be unsealed unless it be broken?

<br>

只有深哀和极乐才能显露你的真实。

如果你愿意被显露出来，你必须在阳光中裸舞，或是背起你的十字架。

Only great sorrow or great joy can reveal your truth.

If you would be revealed you must either dance naked in the sun, or carry your cross.

<br>

你在白天的太阳前面是自由的，在黑夜的星辰前面也是自由的；

在没有太阳，没有月亮，没有星辰的时候，你也是自由的。

就是在你对世上一切闭起眼睛的时候，你也是自由的。

但是你是你所爱的人的奴隶，因为你爱了他。

你也是爱你的人的奴隶，因为他爱了你。

You are free before the sun of the day, and free before the stars of the night;

And you are free when there is no sun and no moon and no star.

You are even free when you close your eyes upon all there is.

But you are a slave to him whom you love because you love him,

And a slave to him who loves you because he loves you.

<br>

我是烈火，我也是枯枝，一部分的我消耗了另一部分的我。

I am the flame and I am the dry bush, and one part of me consumes the other part.

<br>

我是一个旅行者，也是一个航海者，我每天在我的灵魂中发现一个新的王国。

A traveler am I and a navigator, and every day I discover a new region within my soul.

<br>

我对生命说：“我要听死亡说话。”

生命把她的声音提高一点说：“现在你听到他说话了。”

I said to Life, "I would hear Death speak."

And Life raised her voice a little higher and said, "You hear him now."

当你解答了生命的一切奥秘，你就渴望死亡，因为它不过是生命的另一个奥秘。

When you have solved all the mysteries of life you long for death, for it is but another mystery of life.

<br>

Man is two men; one is awake in darkness, the other is asleep in light.

<br>

你不过是你的大我的一个碎片，一张寻求面包的嘴，一只盲目的、为一张干渴的嘴举着水杯的手。

You are but a fragment of your giant self, a mouth that seeks bread, and a blind hand that holds the cup for a thirsty mouth.
