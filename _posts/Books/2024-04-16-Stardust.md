> "I would go to India for you, Victoria Forester, and bring you the tusks of elephants, and pearls as big as your thumb, and rubies the size of wren's eggs.
>
> "I would go to Africa, and bring you diamonds the size of cricket balls. I would find the source of the Nile and name it after you.
>
> "I would go to America - all the way to San Francisco, to the gold-fields, and I would not come back until I had your weight in gold. Then I would carry it back here, and lay it at your feet.
>
> "I would travel to the distant northlands did you but say the word, and slay the mighty polar bears, and bring you back their hides.
>
> "I would travel to far Cathay for you and bring you a huge junk I would capture from the king of the pirates, laden with jade and silk and opium.
>
> "I would go to Australia, at the bottom of the world, and bring you. Um. A kangaroo, and opals."

> ——Chapter Two

熟悉的盖曼式的排比段落，感觉好像每一本都能在某些不经意的地方找到相似的畅快淋漓的诗一样的大段排比。

年轻的浪漫的少年，用诗一般的语言表白心爱的女孩，愿意走遍天涯海角来证明他的爱，但这位女孩想要的可不是在家以外的地方可以找寻到。而哪怕Tristran自己还没有意识到，这几大段早就已经表露出了他对旅游的热爱，哪怕他自己从来还没有走出过Wall这个小镇太远，他的心（和头脑里储藏的书和故事）早就已经飘遍了整个现实世界。而很快他也要踏遍整个Faerie的土地了。

哪怕作者不说更多，这份浪漫、多情、好奇、想象力、对看看这个世界的欲望和热情，都已经在字里行间跃然纸上了。

> She crouched beside her chariot and whispered several words to it. The chariot did nothing, and the witch-woman stamped her foot on the rock.
>
> "I am getting old," she said to her two servants. They said nothing in reply, gave no indication that they even understood her. "<u>Things inanimate have always been more difficult to change than things animate. Their souls are older and stupider and harder to persuade.</u> If I but had my true youth again... why, in the dawn of the world I could transform mountains into seas and clouds into palaces. I could populate cities with the pebbles on the single. If I were young again..."

> ——Chapter Six

变形术的本质是persuading，而无生命的物体的灵魂总是衰老的、愚蠢的、固执的，不容易被说服，于是也不容易改变。好有趣的关于变形术本质的解释，也很有道理呢。万物都有灵魂，you just need to listen, and talk to them.

想起来，Doctor可不也用过这种方法说服过一扇门为他打开？小十：“I know it's not easy to be a door, people coming in and out but no one really looked at you, noticed you.”而门欣然为他打开。他总是很persuasive。小十：“Thank you.”

不过这里的女巫可不会为她成功persuade了的任何人或是物件道谢。But maybe she should.

> *Adventures are all very well in their place*, he thought, *but there's a lot to be said for regular meals and freedom from pain.*
>
> Still, he was alive, and the wind was in his hair, and the cloud was scudding through the sky like a galleon at full sail. Looking out over the world from above, he could never remember feeling so alive as he did at that moment. <u>There was a *skyness* to the sky and a *nowness* to the world that he had never seen or felt or realized before.</u>
>
> He understood that he was, in some way, above his problems, just as he was above the world. The pain in his hand was a long way away. He thought about his actions and his adventures, and about the journey ahead of him, and it seemed to Tristran that the whole business was suddenly very small and very straightforward.
>
> ——Chapter Eight

“There was a skyness to the sky and a nowness to the world”，啊好喜欢这一句，被戳到也很容易地感受到了想要表达的含义。天空有一种真实的天空的感觉，而这个世界也有一种当下的真实存在的样子。找不到比skyness和nowness更合适的词了，也完全翻译不出那种感觉，但读着这个句子，就感到被理解，感到这是最完美的用词了。盖曼的措辞总是那么精确。

好像在那个瞬间，突然终于感觉到这个世界和自己都是真实的，时间停止，多余的思绪停止，只是存在着，用心而专注地感受到世界和天空和当下这个瞬间都是真实的。在经历了太久的失真感之后已经要忘记那种感觉是怎么样的，要怎么做才能重新拥有了，但我知道它存在，我知道那种美好的瞬间的感觉。很难得，要有一颗平和的心才能做到。

所以那就是那个瞬间Tristran的感觉，在云端之上，平和、真实、喜悦地感受着自己和这个世界的存在。几乎有种超然物外的感觉了，可又从未如此真实。

> "What have you done?" Spittle flecked the old woman's lips.
>
> "I have done nothing; nothing that I did not do eighteen years ago. I was bound to you to be your slave until the day that the moon lost her daughter, if it occurred in a week when two Mondays came together. And my time with you is almost done."
>
> ——Chapter Ten

熟悉的盖曼式的word puzzle。当诅咒是一些精妙的词语组合，那么一定有同样精妙的方式可以让它们实现从而被破解。

“moon lost her daughter”“two Mondays came together”，前面出现了那么多次的Mr. Monday我都没有反应过来，知道Victoria同意了求婚才后知后觉地反应过来。可真是非常聪明的设计。

> Tristran and Yvaine were happy together. Not forever-after, for Time, the thief, eventually takes all things into his dusty storehouse, but they were happy, as these things go, for a long while. And then Death came in the night and whispered her secret into the ear of the eighty-second Lord of Stormhold, and he nodded his grey head and he said nothing more, and his people took his remains to the Hall of Ancestors where they lie to this day.
>
> After Tristran's death, there were those who claimed that he was a member of the Fellowship of the Castle, and was instrumental in breaking the power of the Unseelie Court. But the truth of that, as so much else, died with him and has never been established, neither one way nor another.
>
> Yvaine became the Lady of Stormhold, and proved a better monarch, in peace and in war, than any would have dared to hope. She did not age as her husband had aged, and her eyes remained as blue, her hair as golden-white, and - as the free citizens of the Stormhold would have occasional cause to discover - her temper as quick to flare as on the day that Tristran first encountered her in the glade beside the pool.
>
> She walks with a limp to this day, although no one in the Stormhold would ever remark upon it, any more than they dare remark upon the way she glitters and shines, upon occasion, in the darkness.
>
> They say that each night, when the duties of state permit, she climbs, on foot, and limps, alone, to the highest peak of the palace, where she stands for hour after hour, seeming not to notice the cold peak winds. She says nothing at all, but simply stares upward into the dark sky and watches, with sad eyes, the slow dance of the infinite stars.

> ——Epilogue

非常非常非常非常喜欢这个Epilogue，整本书最喜欢的部分大概就是这个Epilogue了，而这个Epilogue里最喜欢的又是最后几段，尤其是最后一段，最后一句。

非常有托尔金的感觉，就像永生的精灵和人类的王。当有限生命的人类贤明的君主逝去之后，无限生命的伴侣走上他的王位，兢兢业业日复一日地统治他的王国，带领他的人民，辛劳而完美地执行王的职责，只有在夜深时刻才能怀念自己的爱人和远离了的自己的族人。孤独而哀伤地度过剩下的永生，靠爱和回忆走下去，不会后悔自己曾经的选择，不会遗忘两个人一起度过的任何一点快乐时光。

“They live happily, but not forever-after.”从这里直到最后，才是这整个童话故事最不像童话的地方，让整个本可以在那里就以HE收尾的故事，兜兜转转来到了一个不那么快乐的结局。哪怕之前99.9%的故事都是快乐地轻松地看下来的，到这最后一段，最后一句，看着这颗掉下来的星星用sad eyes望着回不去的星空，还是难免替她感到落寂哀伤了。于是看完整本书的心情也跟着沉下去，对整个故事的记忆和评价也便随之改变了。

果然还是不得不承认，盖曼对故事结尾的掌控总是一流的，不管长篇短篇，不管前面的故事情节如何，他写出来的结尾总是不会让人失望。

<br>

先看的《星尘》电影然后来看这本书，已经忘记了电影的具体内容和画面（或许最近可以重温一下了），只记得当初看完之后相当喜欢，没记错的话甚至用“最近很长一段时间里看过的最喜欢的电影”这样的评价来描述它。而看原版书反而没有这样高的评价了（也可能只是因为对电影的喜爱提高了对书的期待）。

诚然是个不错的童话故事，充满了童话元素，会是小孩子喜欢的，但剧情方面读来反而并不觉得足够印象深刻。难怪电影会相较之下更加成功了，将那些魔法和变幻莫测的faerie land用精妙的特效搬上银幕，留给剧情和思考的余地就少了。（总感觉电影里结局的冲突似乎还要更加严重些，关于星尘的那颗心的争夺，而书里就平淡多了，也可能是记忆出错了？）

故事的四条支线——男女主，卖花的女巫和彩色大鸟，想要青春的老女巫，争夺王位的几位王子和他们的幽灵兄弟们——两两都多少有过些交集，而之前的交集又对之后的故事剧情造成了蛇咬尾式的影响，设计上确实看得出铺垫和回收的结构是完整的，但真实在阅读时仍然感到故事节奏似乎并不是最舒适的。起初的几章总感到节奏太慢，每一条支线仍然在铺垫中，于是在看不出进展前景和故事主线有什么关系的情况下几乎叫人失去耐心，等到章节过半才渐渐好转。

但另一个很有些想要诟病的地方是：这故事里的冲突用巧合的方式来解决似乎未免也太多了些。卖花的女巫看不见星尘，而老女巫来问询时星尘正好好地躺在她的车厢里；几位王子就这样接二连三地在彼此的争斗中下线，甚至没有看见过星尘本人；走不动路时有独角兽帮忙，找不到星尘时有树精提供精囊妙计，在女巫的旅店里几乎被杀时有残余的蜡烛，在云上下不来时有蒸汽飞船。I mean，我知道他们是童话故事男女主，但这也真是实在太迪士尼童话了。

更别说这种爱的女人嫁给了别的男人、但跟自己一路拌嘴的姑娘变成了自己的爱人、在一无所知的情况下突然被告知所有的舅舅都死了自己可以回家继承王位、突然发现一路都是女巫奴隶的小鸟是自己的母亲的剧情，虽然男主也确实是很可爱善良有爱的男孩子，但这种在任务完成的瞬间同时拥有了永恒生命的爱人、非人类的失踪已久的母亲、所有舅舅都互相厮杀觊觎追逐不到而自动掉到头上的王位（而且王位的标志物正是让爱人掉到自己身边的罪魁祸首，所以女主这是千里迢迢把自己和王位都送到了男主手里）的buff？总还是感到太犯规了一点。哪里会有人能有这么多好运、能让所有好事都发生在一个人头上、而且还是同一天发生的呢？

又或者，跟男主的好运比起来，我还是更多地在为星尘感到共情和心疼吧。Tristran答应过帮她回到天上去的，但终究还是做不到，掉下来就是掉下来了，最靠近天空的地方是城堡最高处露天的房间。她不在意财富王位这所有人世间的物质的东西，她想家，但她回不到母亲和姐妹身边去了，回不到那个她可以夜夜待在上面俯视观察人世间的地方。不过往好了想，她现在也喜欢上地面上的生活了，与其夜夜只能在上面远远地俯视，不如亲自下来走一走，和爱的人一起走遍所有山川大河，亲身体验一遍，有限岁月里的乐趣会比在上面的无限时光加起来还要有趣。也或许，这是她不得不用来自我安慰的话吧，毕竟，到最后只剩下了她一个人，她还能有什么别的选择呢？
