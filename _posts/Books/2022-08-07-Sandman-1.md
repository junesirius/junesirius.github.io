漫画真的是一种艺术，文字和画面的表现张力完美介于纯文字艺术的小说和纯画面艺术的影视剧之间，在兼顾文字和画面、动态和静态之间达成一种完美的平衡。但驾驭难度也因此比小说影视剧高出许多，其中一个原因也正是因为，要完成兼顾的效果往往就需要多人的合作，作者与画手、对话框字体设计、排版等等都需要在想象上达成一种统一，于是也难怪优秀的漫画作品也属实极为难得。

### The Sleep of the Just

> I give you the coin I made from a stone.
>
> I give you a song I stole from the dirt.
>
> I give you a knife from under the hills.
>
> And a stick that I stuck through a dead man's eye.
>
> I give you a claw I ripped from a rat.
>
> I give you a name, and the name is lost.
>
> I give you the blood, from out of my vein.
>
> And a feather I pulled from an angel's wing.

连召唤的咒语也美得像诗，又自然地带了一种黑暗感，真是非常适合召唤无尽了。不知道单纯只是写下这些字符，在心里默念，会不会也有一些残余的魔法影响呢？比如并非让梦神来到现实，只是进入我今晚的梦境？

> (tomb: ) Not dead, only sleeping

> Moved to a hospital specializing in encephalitis cases, Ellie continues to sleep. There are many there like her. People for whom **the sand of time** stopped flowing, sometime half a century earlier.
>
> Daniel sleepwalks unspeaking through his world. He moves slowly, like a man wading through **quicksand**.

为什么Dream Lord是sandman？为什么梦和沙构成了联系？为什么梦和死亡同属于无尽，而梦是死亡最小的brother？这段比喻大概已经给出了答案。"People for whom the sand of time stopped flowing", and sleepwalking in the living world is like a man wading through quicksand. Sand, time, dream, life, death，何不就是同一类东西，they all gone fast.

It's almost like a puzzle, to find their connection. And once the missing piece is found, it all feels so right.

### Imperfect Hosts

> The prince of stories.

The Lord of Dream and Nightmare, also the prince of stories. Of course, what else can dreams be other than stories. So every time when I get story inspiration from dreams, I'm actually blessed by the dearest prince of stories. Thank you, love.

> The air is musty, tired, old; it smells of lost dreams and rotten fabric.

> The dreamworld, the dreamtime, the unconscious - call it what you will - is as much part of me as I am part of it.

### Dream a Little Dream of Me

> "Hullo London."
>
> "Hullo John Constantine."
>
> "How are you then, London?"
>
> "All right. Full of people. Raining. You?"
>
> "Aah. Not bad. It's almost lunchtime, so I'm heading into town for breakfast."
>
> "Good idea, John."
>
> "Thank you, London."

好可爱！突然被康康可爱死了，出门吃个早饭，“Hullo London”，没人打招呼所以只能跟这座城市说声早安，孤独但也自得其乐。还有这声“hullo”，直接能幻听出康康说话声音了。以及这上面的一句里直接同时出现了两个标志性用词“bastards”和“bloody”，更是没办法不直接听到康康自己说出这些对话。真是非常喜欢康康的说话风格和声音呢。

### A Hope in Hell

> Tonight I feel alone.
>
> I have always been solitary, but here on the nightward shores of dream, loneliness washes over me in waves, lapping and pulling at my spirit.

Beautiful, something I could steal, or borrow.

> I am a dire wolf, prey-stalking, lethal prowler.
>
> I am a hunter, horse-mounted, wolf-stabbing.
>
> I am a horsefly, horse-stinging, hunter-throwing.
>
> I am a spider, fly-consuming, eight legged.
>
> I am a snake, spider-devouring, poison-toothed.
>
> I am an ox, snake-crushing, heavy footed.
>
> I am an anthrax, butcher bacterium, warm-life destroying.
>
> I am a world, space-floating, life nurturing.
>
> I am a nova, all-exploding, planet-cremating.
>
> I am the universe, all things encompassing, all life embracing.
>
> I am anti-life, the beast of judgement. I am the dark at the end of everything. The end of universes, gods, worlds, of everything.
>
> I am hope.

The famous challenge in hell. I love it so much. So elegant, like poetry.

And a competition of imagination. And for sure, the Lord of Dream will never lose in a competition of imagination.

这一段在剧里的表现力比漫画强得太多，色彩的运用，在对决中的优势劣势交替，每一句“I am”仿佛真的能感受到梦主和路西变成了他们所声称的那些东西，当蛇被牛蹄碾压时路西所受的伤，当宇宙被反物质侵蚀时在地上奄奄一息的梦主，在濒临死亡的那刻用微弱的气息说出“I am hope”，那种在绝境中被希望所拯救的感触，实在非常有感染力，“希望”能战胜哪怕反物质，战胜一切黑暗，而墨菲斯能在地狱获得胜利，唯一所依赖的也只有希望。或许再加一点点想象力，和不多的一些运气。真的非常喜欢了。以及不得不承认，战损的梦主可真是比平时更让人心生爱怜。

> All is real. Nothing is real.

> What power have dreams in hell?
>
> Tell me, Lucifer Morningstar. Ask yourselves, all of you... What power would HELL have if those here imprisoned were NOT able to DREAM of HEAVEN?

If it's not the dreams, if there is no hope, how can we survive this living hell, how can we bear the suffering in the life, and all the pains and hurts and desperations and exhaustions. If it's not the dreams, where else can we escape to, to run away from this world. To know, that things don't have to be like this, that there is always a chance, another world, another dream, that things are different.

### Passengers

> Do you know what dreams are made of?
>
> Made of? They're just dreams...
>
> No. They aren't. People think dreams aren't real because they aren't made of matter, of particles. Dreams ARE real. But they are made of viewpoints, of images, of memories and puns and lost hopes...

Always believe dreams are real, they are what happened in a different universe.

"Are these real or only happen in my mind?" "Happening in your mind doesn't mean they are not real." Just like what Dumbledore said.

> I am a passenger. I am moving through your dreams. I am riding in your dreams.
>
> I ride on dragon back from Manhattan; the dragon is made of rivetted iron and smells of cotton candy.
>
> I travel briefly by bus: in the back the dreamer copulates desperately, not noticing his autonomous passenger. I sit at the front and talk to the driver.
>
> Approaching the state of Delaware, the dreamer is a small dog, dreaming impatiently of a past life, long forgotten, when he sailed tall ships across uncharted seas. The salt spray of the ocean stings my face.
>
> I am moving through dreams, pulling toward Mayhew, feeling for jewel.
>
> Through your dreams, my sleeping children. You had a passenger, and you never knew.

好喜欢这段独白。原来这章标题的“passenger”是这个意思！梦的乘客，在梦之间穿梭行走，好美，也很有诗意。大概也会很像一场冒险，随时都可能因为做梦的人开始想象不同的东西而跟着颠簸，时不时会有些意料之外的风波，也是别有一番趣味。如果能拍出来的话在视觉效果上一定也会很有趣，光是看着漫画和文字已经可以想象到了。

好喜欢那只梦到船和海的小狗，感觉那也是一个故事，有点《一千只猫的梦》的味道。

### Waiting for the End of the World

Disturbing. 虽然看过剧早就知道这部分的剧情，再看漫画也仍然很需要一个trigger warning。或许很大程度上因为漫画里的John实在是比剧里更加……缺少人性（比如搭了车感受到好意还要开枪那段），包括外貌也都是更加不像人而像骷髅，于是更难以确定故事走势是否真的会像剧里那样，增加了unpredicability也增加了不安全感。

倒是很喜欢漫画里对时间流逝感的凸显，每隔几页就会标注出“Hour x”，从“Hour 0”到“Hour 23”，24小时店的最后这24小时究竟是怎样一步步变成the end of the world，时间维度上的压迫感再一次让disturbing的程度更上一层楼。每翻过一页就是流逝的一个小时，压迫感、不安感、disturbing不断累积，但是又没有爆发，只是越来越透不过气，就像雷雨前的空气，越来越黑压压，越来越感受到危险的气息但又并不完全清楚究竟是怎样的危险，于是只能继续在不安中挣扎，期待一个抒发的突破口。然后，哗啦，the savior comes，your king comes, 梦主终于走进了这个走向崩溃的小世界，打破这层透不过气的空气，于是在松一口气时愈发对梦主感到了安全感，更爱他了。大概这与“王子打败了恶龙才能赢得公主芳心”属于同一种让人爱上一个角色的套路吧。

回到剧与漫画的区别，或许受到剧的先入印象，在看漫画时总会多少想要把剧里的画面重新映射回漫画，在看前面几章时这种映射都没有什么太大障碍，剧几乎完全就是从漫画里走出来的，于是漫画在大脑中重新变成连续播放的画面，可这章不行。这章的漫画混乱到了一种新的高度，虽然与内容的混乱、末日、毁灭也算是相辅相成，可对于理解故事并没有太大的帮助，于是相比之下倒是更喜欢剧里的呈现了，每一条支线故事有清晰的前因后果，在各条支线相互交叉时那些被迫暴露出来的人性丑陋面和穿插的John的视角，恰到好处地印证了John想要表达的观点，让故事本身发挥了应有的表现张力。

除了一个问题，故事的走向仿佛太容易了一些。头号恶棍为所欲为，把现实世界搅得天翻地覆，几乎陷入世界末日，而梦主对此一筹莫展，可胜利只花了不消一秒，他甚至什么都不需做，红宝石裂成碎片，他获得所有力量，反派被关进阿卡姆，世界恢复正常。这就显得仿佛之前所有强调的危险、不断累积的压迫感，they are nothing，赢得太过轻松，让这段故事多少显得有些虎头蛇尾了。不过反过来想想，好像取回沙袋和头盔也并没有特别艰难：找到康斯坦丁就找到了沙袋，唯一做的事是喝退拦路的小梦魇；头盔的那场对决稍微付出了些努力，被路西法的反物质压制在地上艰难残喘时挣扎说出“hope”才反败为胜，不过如果早就知道希望可以战胜任何一切，早就知道这场游戏的万能赢家，获胜就毫无悬念，于是似乎也并不是太大的挑战了。说到底，可能只是我的xp在于战损吧hhh 在失败的边缘徘徊，陷入危险的境地，无论怎么努力都赢不了，但即便如此也仍然愿意把自己所拥有的一切都投入进去，不顾后果，尤其不顾生命，这才最让我动容，而康斯坦丁和夜魔侠正是那样的人，正是这种我最想看到的故事。

PS：另一个感到很有趣的地方，关于漫画的艺术表现力，关于漫画和剧的区别，关于声音。声音是THE one thing漫画不具有而剧拥有的表现媒介，而这一章，出现了很多很多遍“Listen: ...”，用文字来表现声音，用想象来填补安静的纸页所不能传达的声音，而在想象中，又传达了比剧所能拥有的真实的声音更多的声音。这种想象带来的丰富阅读体验也真是很有乐趣。

### The Sound of Her Wings

> Death is before me today:
>
> Like the recovery of a sick man,
>
> Like going forth into a garden after sickness.
>
> Death is before me today:
>
> Like theodor of myrrh,
>
> Like sitting under a sail in a good wind.
>
> Death is before me today:
>
> Like the course of a stream,
>
> Like the return of a man from the war-galley to his house.
>
> Death is before me today:
>
> Like the home that a man  longs to see,
>
> After year's spent as a captive.

I know I would love this chapter deeply. I love the big sister as much as the young brother.

以及，Dream是真的好喜欢喂鸽子！

### Tales in the Sand

居然有Nada和Dream的故事，好惊喜！在地狱的那一面，真的很让人介意他们曾经有过怎样的过往。“It has been ten thousand years, I still love you, but I have not yet forgiven you.” 究竟是什么，能让Dream耿耿于怀一万年？

> One day a stranger came to the city. Tall he was, and dressed all in black, flames danced in the blackness of his robe, and his eyes were stars in deep pools of dark water.

Ahhh, that's usually how the love begins.

> For love is no part of the dream-world. Love belongs to Desire, and Desire is always cruel.

啊Nada居然是自杀，I didn't see this coming.但是谁规定的“Mortals are not supposed to be with the Endless”和“When they fall in love, bad things happen”？还有那Sun，who is this to decide "something that was not meant to be had happened"?（可能这就是天谴）but why?

“I love you but I can't be with you. For three times, I refuse you. I kill myself to run away from you.”好虐，好香，好有圣经的痕迹。以及，确实很可以理解为什么Dream会still love her, still can't forgive her了, for her rather choose the realm of death than the realm of dream.

以及，当Dream, Death, Desire都成了实体，当他们的realm都成了存在的去处，事情确实都变得有趣了。Everything has a place to go, has someone to blame. 尤其是Desire，看剧的时候感到尤其明显，你或许可以指责Desire是一切幕后指使者，是所谓的“反派”，可当反派是一种情绪，一种欲望，一种动机时，真正的反派仍然是拥有那些欲望的人而非欲望本身（“有错的不是刀，而是拿刀的人”），所以Desire所导致的事，全不该怪罪他/她，而只是源于人性了。这就让故事变得很有趣。无尽家族的每一个成员连同“无尽”名字一起都让人着迷，“The Endless”实在是一种非常巧妙的构思了。

### Men of Good Fortune

看剧的时候就超级喜欢每一百年见一次面的这段剧情，被赋予了不死的人类和沉默的好奇的Dream，历史真是一种取之不尽的素材，而盖曼也着实很擅长利用这种天然资源了，好兆头里的六千年历史也至今仍是我最喜欢的部分（之一）。

Ups and downs, hated every second of the last eighty years, yet still, "Do you still wish to live? Do you not seek the respite of death?" "Are you crazy? Death is a mug's game. I got so much to live for." 这是我也会感到好奇的部分了，究竟为什么有些人会对“活着”产生如此强烈的渴望和热情，到底有什么让这些人类感到“so much to live for”。我甚至可以很容易地想象自己站在梦主的位置上，对这些人类感到interested，偶尔amused，非常偶尔inspired，观察他们mess up with他们的生活，但是somehow仍然愿意活下去，想要体验更多，我想通过他们的眼睛去观察这个世界，去了解他们的生活方式，但并不想作为人类生活在他们的世界上，生活他们的生活，in other words, I may prefer to only live distantly, keep a distance, to be safe from the pain and hurt in that world, even if knowing pain is also part of the life.

于是想到了另一个对人类充满了好奇、对生活和这个世界充满了难以想象的热情的人——Doctor Who。不过即使是博士也并非永远在他的永生中都充满了同样的热情，十二叔时期的低沉也不是没有过的。所以想到的博士其实大部分时候特指小十了。哪怕在近乎永生的生命里早就见识过足够多次人性的恶，命运的残忍，爱过，然后感受爱被剥离，一次又一次，用各种整个宇宙都难以想象的方式，然后带着那些痛继续穿梭在这个宇宙的时空隧道中，他（还是习惯地用“他”来指代了，十三姨sorry bear with me）仍然从未对人类失去希望，从未对这个星球，这个世界，对生活，生命，失去信心。他称赞人类的美到了一种我作为人类都感到自惭形秽的地步，他爱着这些，理解这些，于是不知不觉也强迫我从他的视角去看这个世界，去学习怎样成为他认识的人类的模样，去像他一样热爱这个世界，和驻足在这个世界上的时间。

说回到梦主，见过他在五百年里都准时出现在同一家酒馆，见同一个人类，顺带听听碰巧同时也出现在这里的其他人类，问问他其实早已知道的一百年间发生的事，仍然饶有兴致地继续同人类谈话，于是忍不住也会想，他究竟有多爱人类，多爱人类所处的这个世界呢。虽然剧里其实死神姐姐也已经跟他说过，人类需要无尽as much as无尽需要人类，但“需要”也并不代表他会去关注他们，去爱他们，去了解他们，而他，现在（或是从时间伊始便是）正在做这所有。所以或许可以很safely speaking，哪怕他看起来或许试图掩盖，he cares about human。

Start from taking care **for** them, then care **about**，再然后或许是更多的共情和关注了，尤其是对于这个specific human，从五百年前就结识的“朋友”。墨菲斯，不知道他到底拥有过多少朋友呢？不算家人，看起来似乎只有梦境世界由他自己创造的那几位，鸦鸦马修，露西安，路西法或许也能算acquittance，被他亲手送进地狱的曾经的爱人，除此之外就没什么了。于是孤独，哪怕他从未意识到过自己的孤独也从未意识到过自己的渴望，毫无疑问地混合在星空色的披风里将他包裹了，与他形影不离。看了越多作品越感到，孤独真是一个比爱和死更永恒的主题，对墨菲斯来说更是如此。一个小男孩，在自己创建的王国里，用自己的想象力捏造出他的臣民，成为他们的王，这听起来实在很像所有安静的孤独的自闭的小孩的故事，于是这毫无疑问也是他的故事了。就像所有孤独的人一样，他也会渴望陪伴，哪怕他没有意识到，哪怕他想要deny，或许，这只是因为他知道，只有在拥有过温暖和友谊和陪伴和这所有美好的东西之后，才会在失去时感到孤独难以忍受。只有推离，只有条件反射的用高傲作为伪装的自我保护，才能让自己避免美好被破坏或是被剥夺时的痛苦，哪怕代价是永恒的孤独。还好，总有那么一些人，在被推离，在你用各式各样的伪装进行自我保护时，reach out，突破那些伪装，站在你的面前，告诉你，“I see you”，告诉你，你不孤独，因为他们在你身边。于是你知道，你也可以拥有朋友，拥有陪伴，在很小很小的一段时间里，忘记孤独这件事。不过当然，孤独从未离去，无论谁在那里，无论你在哪里。

突然想到了另一件事，关于名字。说来奇怪，一直叫习惯了“梦主”，刚才突然顺手写下了“墨菲斯”，然后感到了莫名的亲昵。细想或许是因为梦主大概不过是像一个职业，就好像叫他老师，或者司机，或者教练，general，distant，所有人都可能成为梦主，而不是非他不可（只不过他碰巧出生在无尽家族，碰巧是最小的孩子，碰巧掌管了Dream Realm，于是这份职业就自然而然非他莫属了）。但如果称呼他“墨菲斯”，那便是完全地在叫他这个人了，直直地面对他，完整的他，无论他是否是梦主，无论他是否在梦境王国工作，就好像第一次在工作之外遇见一个同事，仿佛开始认识另一个不同的人。名字果然是有魔力的，墨菲斯，我呼唤你，我召唤你，我大概要放弃梦主这个称呼了，如果我拥有墨菲斯，那便也一定同梦主在一起了，而反之则不必然。哦我甚至开始对于打出墨菲斯这几个字开始感到胆怯了，每一遍敲打，每一遍在心里默念，我真的可以感受到魔力轻轻流淌，这几个字闪着星星的光芒，蓝紫色的星空为底，被火焰色的裙摆包围，好像他真的可以听到我的每一声呼唤，真的可以凭空降临到我身边，而今晚，我毫不怀疑，他会邀请我前往他的皇宫，在他的王国徜徉。（好神奇，现在的我写着这些字，越写越感到困意浓重，好像他正在从梦境世界把我拉向他，好像他真的听到了我所说所写的所有话，正热切地想要我去见他。不过为什么不来这个世界见我呢？可能现实世界的空气不适合他呼吸？还是这个缺乏魔法的世界连空气都是实体，都是透明的墙，没有魔法和咒语的帮助他难以穿透过来？倒是和童话镇的设定很容易相互融合，这或许也可以变成一个新的故事？比如被困在现实的童话镇里的墨菲斯？而墨菲斯把这个小镇整个地都用梦境淹没，童话的人物回到他们熟悉的故事里，这是当故事都由梦组成，邪恶的东西便都由大家的恐惧组成，想来也是很不容易逃离的了，直到足够智慧的人冷静下来开始利用他们的恐惧来操纵反派……直到发现，真正被利用的，不是他们的恐惧，而是他们的希望。写着写着发现开始照抄DW The God Complex那集的故事，真的很喜欢任何和梦搭边的故事呢。）

### Calliope

> Will you shut up? I haven't written a word in a year - nothing I haven't thrown away! Do you know what that's like?
>
> When it's just you, and a blank sheet of paper?
>
> When you can't think of a single thing worth saying, a single character that people could believe in, a single story that hasn't been told a thousand times before...

> You want ideas? You want dreams? You want stories?
>
> Then ideas you will have. Ideas in abundance.

> I'm going to a party...
>
> You know, I could write a whole story set at a party. Possibly something could have happened to the world outside - a holocaust of some kind... The people are partying against the darkness.
>
> The fraternity of critics. In reality a dark brethren, linked by profane rites and blood vows. To destroy an author they sacrifice a child and perform a critical mass...
>
> A city in which the streets are paved with time.
>
> A train full of silent women, plowing forever through the twilight.
>
> Heads made of light.
>
> A small piece of blue cardboard.
>
> A plum, sweet and tart and cold.
>
> A were-goldfish who transforms into a wolf at full moon.
>
> Two old women taking a weasel on holiday.
>
> Gryphons shouldn't marry.
>
> Vampires don't dance.
>
> A man who inherits a library card to the Library in Alexandria.
>
> A rose busk, a nightingale, and a black rubber dogcollar.
>

>
> Shark's teeth soup.
>
> An old man in sunderland who owned the universe, and who kept it in a jam-jar in the dusty cupboard under his stairs.
>
> It's the ideas. Where we get them from. A sestina about silence, using the key words dark, ragged, never, screaming, fire, kiss.
>
> A biography of Keats, from the Lamia's viewpoint.
>
> Magical and alchemical traditions seen as a cargo cult.
>
> Aureolus, Theophrastus, Bombastes, Paracelsus, and Raymond Lulli were the same man.
>
> (God - what did you do to your hands?)
>
> All the pictures in my head. I had to get them down, but I didn't have any paper, or ink. So I used the wall. And my fingertips.
>
> All the ideas, inside. All the pictures and poem and tales and songs and plays and speeches and fragments... They're all coming out.
>
> It's her revenge, you see. Or his revenge. I said I needed the ideas - but they're coming so fast, swamping me, overwhelming me...
>
> You have to make them stop.

### A Midsummer Night's Dream

> (But this diversion, although pleasant, is not true. Things never happened thus.)
>
> Oh, but it is true. Things need not have happened to be true. Tales and dreams are the shadow-truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes, and forgot.

### Façade

> I only have two kinds of dreams. The bad and the terrible.
>
> Bad dreams I can cope with. They're just nightmares, and they end eventually. I wake up.
>
> The terrible dreams are the good dreams. In my terrible dreams, everything's fine. I'm still with the company. I still look like me. None of the last five years ever happened. Sometimes I'm married. Once I even had kids. I even knew their names. Everything's wonderful and normal and fine.
>
> And then I wake up. And I'm still me. And I'm still here. And that is truly terrible.

> I want to die. I want to kill myself. And... and I can't!
>
> It's not that I'm too scared to kill myself. I'm scared of lots of things. I'm scared of noises in the night-time, scared of telephones and closed doors, scared of people... scared of everything. Not of death.
>
> I want to die. It's just that I don't know how.
>
> I've been thinking about it for so long, now. I can't slash my wrists - I don't have any blood. When I was at high school, a kid shut himself in a garage, took sleeping pills, climbed inn the cat and turned the ignition. I can't do that. Carbon monoxide's just another gas, to me. And my body just processes poisons. I can't shoot myself. A bullet wouldn't do any real damage. So then I get more extreme.
>
> Maybe I could sit at ground zero of a nuclear test - if I could find one. But I'm afraid I could survive that. I think I would. Perhaps I'd be radioactive for always... but I'd survive. Then no one would ever want to talk to me...
>
> I thought about transmuting myself to free oxygen radicals and just melding with the air. Or with added hydrogen, I could become water and join myself with the sea. But I'd probably still be conscious. Just spread out all over the world.

> I'm not blessed, or merciful. I'm just me. I've got a job to do, and I do it.
>
> Listen: even as we're talking, I'm there for old and young, innocent and guilty, those who die together and those who die alone.
>
> I'm in cars and boats and planes, in hospitals and forests and abattoirs. For some folks death is a release, and for others death is an abomination, a terrible thing. But in the end, I'm there for all of them.
>
> In west Africa a small village is being massacred by mercenaries, in pay of their own government. I'm there.
>
> In the farthest reaches of a distant galaxy, a planet is being ripped apart by internal stresses; the planet was the home of many crystal intelligences, calm and fine and beautiful. I'm there as well.
>
> I'm in all those places, and I'm also here, talking to you. But... I'm not your Death. At least, not yet.
>
> When the first living existed, I was there, waiting. When the last living thing dies, my job will be finished. I'll put the chairs on the tables, turn out the lights and lock the universe behind me when I leave.
