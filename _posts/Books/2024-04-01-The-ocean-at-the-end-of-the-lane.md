> I have dreamed of that song, of the strange words to that simple rhyme-song, and on several occasions I have understood that language too, the first language, and I had dominion over that nature of all that was real. In my dream, it was the tongue of what is, and anything spoken in it becomes real, because nothing said in that language can be a lie. It is the most basic building brick of everything. In my dreams I have used that language to heal the sick and to fly; once I dreamed I kept a perfect little bed-and-breakfast by the seaside, and to everyone who came to stay with me I would say, in that tongue, "Be whole," and they would become whole, not be broken people, not any longer, because I had spoken the language of shaping.
>
> —— Chapter 4

"The language of shaping", "nothing said in that language can be a lie", how beautiful and dreamy, but just as real as the reality because that's just the power of language. When we create something, when we write them down, they become real, in this world or another, they are real. When we understand how to use this power, we are creating the new world.

It's even better here, it's not only a language, it's a song. The lyrics is like a child's song, the rhyme is like for putting baby to sleep. Remind me of the DW series "The Long Song". Songs have as much power (if not more) than written and speaking words. They can be powerful, emotional, astonishing, universe-saving. And anything sung in the song is and will be real. That's the language of creation.

> She was power incarnate, standing in the crackling air. She was the storm, she was the lightning, she was the adult world with all its power and all its secrets and all its foolish casual cruelty.
>
> ...
>
> She was an adult. It did not matter, at that moment, that she was every monster, every witch, every nightmare made flesh. She was also an adult, and when adults fight children, adults always win.
>
> —— Chapter 8

That's it. That's what this story about. The monsters and mysterious childhood memories, that's all about how a child view the adulthood. At that age, age of seven, the adulthood is confusing and secret and full of foolish casual cruelty. And always, almost forever always happens in any culture, means undeniable, undefiable, definite, authority power.

Nothing can be more terrifying than that, than knowing there is something in the world that no matter what you do, can overpower you, can control you. That's the sense of uncontrollable, that monster makes you feel so much insecurity, feel you can never truly be in control of your life or anything at all.

But "I" have Lettie, the magic girl, the girl who are not afraid, who can fight against that terrifying monstrous adulthood. It's a story about magic and mystery, sure, but more about childhood and adulthood confliction, about growth and overcome the fear for the authority.

<br>

Lettie's family only has females. Funny I only notice it now after eight chapters. Only the girl, her mother, and the old granny. No men, no husband or father or grandpa. Only women. All of them were/are/will be called Mrs. Hempstock, but there is no Mr. Hempstock. More like a witch's clan than a family actually.

Now that we know the monster represents adulthood, this small weirdness starts to feel important too. Maybe this terrifying cruelty of authority is also about the authority of this male-dominant world? So women and children are the frontline fighting force?

<br>

By chapter ten, now I feel the black kitten must be important too. It's mentioned constantly, but not doing anything significantly, but it does show up every time important things and twists are happening. Like the first kitten was killed when all the bad things were about to start, and the second kitten appeared when "I" seem to be at the very edge of a miserable life.

Right now it just purred and hugged and got stroked and slept together, not doing anything but doing everything to calm a terrifying boy down. Just like a kitten should and always do. Reminded me of that story in "Smoke and Mirror" about a black cat that is also an angel. Neil must have a really strong special favour for black kittens.

And actually, maybe the kitten's behavior is used as a plot hint? Random guess, but whenever the kitten acts as if no interest or indifferent, I'd just feel somewhat comforting that they are not going to run into some big terrible danger, because the kitten knows it all, foresees it all. If they are going to be endangered, the kitten must would have warned them in some way.

<br>

> "I'm going to tell you something important. Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside either. Outside, they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. The truth is, there aren't any grown-ups. Not one, in the whole wide world."
>
> —— Chapter 10

All grown-ups are still children inside.

<br>

The really funny thing about this "monster" -- I should have noticed this earlier as well -- is that what they are doing is practically "Finding what people think they need and try to give it to them". Giving people money is the very first move, though almost choked them. It's monkey's paw story all over again. Beware, careful about your wishes, carefully choose what you want, because what you *think* you need is not always what you actually most in need of.

>
> —— Chapter 10

The way to trap a monster that represents adulthood and send it home, is to use broken toys from lost memories of the childhood. Every single design in this story has its metaphor and secret deeper meaning. Seemingly so randomly developed story, but every twist and trick is so delicate. That's always the biggest charm in Neil's story. That's something I want to learn and master my own as well.

<br>

> They came as if they had been waiting for her call.
>
> High in the sky they were, and black, jet-black, so black it seemed as if they were specks on my eyes, not real things at all. They had wings, but they were not birds. They were older than birds, and they flew in circles and in loops and whorls, dozens of them, hundreds perhaps, and each flapping unbird slowly, ever so slowly, descended.
>
> I found myself imagining a valley filled with dinosaurs, millions of years ago, who had died in battle, or of disease: imaging first the carcasses of the rotting thunder-lizards, bigger than buses, and then the vultures of that aeon: gray-black, naked, winged but featherless; faces from nightmares - beak-like snouts filled with needle-sharp teeth, made for rending and tearing and devouring, and hungry red eyes. These creatures would have descended on corpses of the great thunder-lizards and left nothing but bones.
>
> Huge, they were, and sleek, and ancient, and it hurt my eyes to look at them.
>
> ...
>
> They descended. I tried to count them, as they landed, and I failed. I had thought that there were hundreds of them, but I might have been wrong. There might have been twenty of them. There might have been a thousand. I could not explain it: perhaps they were from a place where such things as counting didn't apply, somewhere outside of time and numbers.
>
> They landed, and I stared at them, but saw nothing but shadows.
>
> So many shadows.
>
> —— Chapter 11

Brilliant imagination again. It's always hard to describe something like childhood nightmare creature or of that sort. They are terrifying usually because of their mystery, because you can't really imagine what they look like. But this is how Neil will solidify and describe a nightmare, an abstract but real horror-triggering creature. The imagination is doing most of the work. It's just brilliant. I love it, love how the nightmare is like, love how they are described from a scene about dinosaur. It really gives the idea of how big and ancient they are. Association is the key in imagination, remember this, it's helpful for my own writing too.

<br>

> "Hey! Boy!"
>
> I turned. He walked across the lawn toward me. He was dressed as he had been the last time I had seen him: a dinner jacket, a frilly white shirt, a black bow-tie. His face was still an alarming cherry-red, as if he had just spent too long on the beach, but his hands were white. He looked like a waxwork, not a person, something you would expect to see in the Chamber of Horrors. He grinned when he saw me looking at him, and now he looked like a waxwork that was smiling, and I swallowed, and wished that the sun was out again.
>
> —— Chapter 12

Now it starts to feel (more) scary, just like an episode of DW. Giving young audient goosebumps and standing hairs on the end, and hiding behind the sofa to peek through the gap. Nervous and horrified, but still so curious to know what's going to happen next. Neil is the master in manipulating the atmosphere, to make reader feel as if they are there too.

This scene also reminded me a little bit about *Solaris*, was terrified to shivering when reading that one too. Almost give up half-way, but glad I finished the book. Nice and horrifying and inspiring good book, it is.

<br>

> "You are hungry," said the voice in the night, and it was no longer Lettie's voice, not any longer. It might have been the voice inside my own head, but it was speaking aloud. "You are tired. Your family hates you. You have no friends. And Lettie Hempstock, I regret to tell you, is never coming back."
>
> I wished I could have seen who was talking. If you have something specific and visible to fear, rather than something that could be anything, it is easier.
>
> "Nobody cares," said the voice, so resigned, so practical. "Now, step out of the circle and come to us. One step is all it will take. Just put one foot across the threshold and we will make all the pain go away forever: the pain you feel now and the pain that is still to come. It will never happen."
>
> It was not one voice, not any longer. It was two people talking in unison. Or a hundred people. I could not tell. So many voices.
>
> "How can you be happy in this world? You have a hole in your heart. You have a gateway inside you to lands beyond the world you know. They will call you, as you grow. There can never be a time when you forget them, when you are not, in your heart, questing after something you cannot have, something you cannot even properly imagine, the lack of which will spoil your sleep and your day and your life, until you close your eyes for the final time, until your loved ones give you poison and sell you to *anatomy*, and even then you will die with a hole inside you, and you will wail and curse at a life ill-lived. But you won't grow. You can come out, and we will end it, cleanly, or you can die in there, of hunger and of fear. And when you are dead your circle will mean nothing, and we will tear out your heart and take your soul for a keepsake."
>
> —— Chapter 12

Voice in the head, sounds strong and powerful, just all too familiar.

<br>

> The second thing I thought was that I knew everything. Lettie Hempstock's ocean flowed inside me, and it filled the entire universe, from Egg to Rose. I knew that. I knew what Egg was - where the universe began, to the sound of uncreated voices singing in the void - and I knew where Rose was - the peculiar crinkling of space on space into dimensions that fold like origami and blossom like strange orchids, and which would mark the last good time before the eventual end of everything and the next Big Bang, which would be, I knew now, nothing of the kind.
>
> I knew that Old Mrs. Hempstock would be here for that one, as she had been for the last.
>
> I saw the world I had walked since my birth and I understood how fragile it was, that the reality I knew was a thin layer of icing on a great dark birthday cake writhing with grubs and nightmares and hunger. I saw the world from above and below. I saw that there were patterns and gates and paths beyond the real. I saw all these things and understood them and they filled me, just as the waters of the ocean filled me.
>
> Everything whispered inside me. Everything spoke to everything, and I knew it all.
>
> ...
>
> Where Ursula Monkton had been made of gray cloth that flapped and snapped and gusted in the storm-winds, Lettie Hempstock was made of silken sheets the color of ice, filled with tiny flickering candle flames, a hundred hundred candle flames.
>
> Could there be candle flames burning under the water? There could. I knew that, when I was in the ocean, and I even knew how. I understood it just as I understood Dark Matter, the material of the universe that makes up everything that must be there but we cannot find. I found myself thinking of an ocean running beneath the whole universe, like the dark seawater that laps beneath the wooden boards of an old pier: an ocean that stretches from forever to forever and is still small enough to fit inside a bucket, if you have Old Mrs. Hempstock to help you get it in there, and you ask nicely.
>
> ...
>
> That if I looked inward I would see only infinite mirrors, staring into myself for eternity.
>
> ...
>
> The ocean was back in the pond, and the only knowledge I was left with, as if I had woken from a dream on a summer's day, was that it had not been long ago since I had known everything.
>
> —— Chapter 13

这两页读得真是非常酣畅淋漓，可以想象盖曼写的时候大概也是一气呵成舒畅至极，好像写这一整个故事就是为了写这一个瞬间，为了这种酣畅的体验，在这之前的铺垫全是为了准备好进入这一刻的心情，而这之后的所有则全是回味。就像精心准备的晚餐大餐里最精华的一口佳肴，只有一口的分量，品尝得被美味震撼得整个身心都在充分发挥感官去享受它，而这之前和之后所有的佳肴都变得逊色了。

对一个作者来说很多时候构思一个故事其实就是从这样一刻的灵感开始的，再往前往后延伸出去构成一整个完整的故事，而真正最想描绘的其实只有这一个画面，这一个场景，这最高潮最精心的瞬间。还没有写到它时总是煎熬的等待，常常会失去耐心等不到它的到来就放弃这个故事，而偶尔终于耐着性子写到这一段时会感到一种酣畅的成就感和幸福感，仿佛一直憋着气潜水，到这个时候突然终于得到准许浮到水面去长长地换一口气，感受那清新可爱极了的空气涌入身体充满胸腔。这是对写作者来说堪称最热爱和感动的时刻了吧。

<br>

> My eyes had become too used to the darkness, and I could not look at her face to see if it was the face I was familiar with: it was too bright. Magnesium-flare bright. Fireworks Night bright. Midday-sun-reflecting-off-a-silver-coin bright.

> "Shall I bind you creatures in the heart of a dark star, to feel your pain in a place where every fragment of a moment lasts a thousand years? Shall I invoke the compacts of Creation, and have you all removed from the list of created things, so there never will have been any hunger birds, and anything that wishes to traipse from world to world can do it with impunity?"
>
> —— Chapter 14

The famous reassuring moment in a disaster story when the savior comes. The outrageous warning after seeing a loved one is hurt, it sounds so much like The Doctor. "Bind you in the heart of a dark star", isn't that exactly what The 10th Doctor did to the blood family after he trapped himself in a human life and kept his memory inside a watch, only retrieving his identity after his loved ones are hurt? Loved it so much, the humanity and the authority in him, the side that makes them so human and the side that is so powerful, they are the creator of the universe, yet they make tea and knit for the neighborhood boy. Imagine the creator of the universe is your next door granny, it's so adorable. Actually, maybe that's exactly who the next door gran is. Who knows.

<br>

> "They could have hurt you, child, and it would have meant nothing. They could have hurt this world without anything being said - it's only a world, after all, and they're just sand grains in the desert, worlds. But Lettie's a Hempstock. She's outside of their dominion, my little one. And they hurted her."
>
> —— Chapter 14

The world is just a world, like a sand in the grain, but the girl is all above that, says the mother. It's so... just like what a god/goddess would think: the worlds are small to them. But it's not the case for Lettie or Gran, they are more human than gods now. They love the world just like human (like "I"), or maybe even more. Just like The Doctor to the Earth.

<br>

> "You come back, sometimes," she said. "You were here once when you were twenty-four, I remember. You had two young children, and you were so scared. You came here before you left this part of the world: You were, what, in your thirties, then? I fed you a good meal in the kitchen, and you told me about your dreams and the art you were making."
>
> "I don't remember."
>
> She pushed the hair from her eyes. "It's easier that way."
>
> —— Epilogue

Now it sounds more and more like semi-autography. Remember the ocean being the metaphor, then revisiting the childhood and forgetting these revisits all make so much sense. It's still about growing up, even when the seven-year-old turning into twenty-four-year-old, and then thirties and now forties, he can still get so easily terrified, confused, lost, like everyone else in this world. So when these times come, the best place to go is the ocean at the end of the lane where the childhood dream girl get buried. Talking about "dreams and the art he was making", is just how I would imagine Neil's life is like at around that young age. Ocean is like another mind palace, a place in the memory that is so vivid that it has to be real, but also just like a wandering dream, leaving only mystery and more regret for the future self to ponder.

<br>

> "And did I pass?"
>
> "You don't pass or fail at being a person, dear."
>
> "I think you're doing better than you were the last time we saw yo. You're growing a new heart, for a start."
>
> "So what will happen now?"
>
> "Same thing as happens every other time you've come here, you go home."
>
> "I don't know where that is, anymore."
>
> "You always say that."
>
> —— Epilogue

Life is not a test, it's a game, an adventure.

Just be careful not losing your heart easily. Or grow a new one, if that already happened.

<br>

> I said, "It's funny. For a moment, I thought there were two of you. Isn't that odd?"
>
> "It's just me," said the old woman. "It's only ever just me."
>
> "I know," I said. "Of course it is."
>
> —— Epilogue

Ok, that's a twist, it got me. In the very last page, still more surprise to come, that's the Neil Gaiman writing that I admired about.

<br>

Not even after finishing the last word do I know whose funeral it is that "I" was attending, I've been very curious about that part but the hints aren't enough to tell me the answer. Guess it's just not that important.

Finished it in two days, though the first forty pages are just a re-read of where I left over last time. The pace in the first three chapters are so slow that I guess was the reason why I failed to finish the book the first time I pick it up. But now I just can't stop until finish it once pass the forth chapter. It's a nice-written story, interesting, fictional, fantasy, intriguing, wouldn't see how the plots are going while reading, unexpected (always love that), terrifying (sometimes), descriptive and vivid (as if watching movies), warm, slightly heartbroken but not entirely too sad (the control of emotion here is so delicate as if the writer is a masterful surgeon), connected and associated (makes me think about my childhood fantasy and mind palace), empathetic, real (as if I was there, the "me" in the story, experiencing all that in the first person view), descriptive (I would never thought of describing those imaginary monsters that way, especially the dying dinosaur part for the hunger birds, really impressive and I might borrow/steal it some time later).

It's good, it's very Neil Gaiman style, but I probably wouldn't call it his best book, because, admit it, he just has too much too brilliant works. I enjoyed it anyway. Now, move on to his next story.
