漫画真的是一种艺术，文字和画面的表现张力完美介于纯文字艺术的小说和纯画面艺术的影视剧之间，在兼顾文字和画面、动态和静态之间达成一种完美的平衡。但驾驭难度也因此比小说影视剧高出许多，其中一个原因也正是因为，要完成兼顾的效果往往就需要多人的合作，作者与画手、对话框字体设计、排版等等都需要在想象上达成一种统一，于是也难怪优秀的漫画作品也属实极为难得。

### The Sleep of the Just

> I give you the coin I made from a stone.
>
> I give you a song I stole from the dirt.
>
> I give you a knife from under the hills.
>
> And a stick that I stuck through a dead man's eye.
>
> I give you a claw I ripped from a rat.
>
> I give you a name, and the name is lost.
>
> I give you the blood, from out of my vein.
>
> And a feather I pulled from an angel's wing.

连召唤的咒语也美得像诗，又自然地带了一种黑暗感，真是非常适合召唤无尽了。不知道单纯只是写下这些字符，在心里默念，会不会也有一些残余的魔法影响呢？比如并非让梦神来到现实，只是进入我今晚的梦境？

> (tomb: ) Not dead, only sleeping

> Moved to a hospital specializing in encephalitis cases, Ellie continues to sleep. There are many there like her. People for whom **the sand of time** stopped flowing, sometime half a century earlier.
>
> Daniel sleepwalks unspeaking through his world. He moves slowly, like a man wading through **quicksand**.

为什么Dream Lord是sandman？为什么梦和沙构成了联系？为什么梦和死亡同属于无尽，而梦是死亡最小的brother？这段比喻大概已经给出了答案。"People for whom the sand of time stopped flowing", and sleepwalking in the living world is like a man wading through quicksand. Sand, time, dream, life, death，何不就是同一类东西，they all gone fast.

It's almost like a puzzle, to find their connection. And once the missing piece is found, it all feels so right.

### Imperfect Hosts

> The prince of stories.

The Lord of Dream and Nightmare, also the prince of stories. Of course, what else can dreams be other than stories. So every time when I get story inspiration from dreams, I'm actually blessed by the dearest prince of stories. Thank you, love.

> The air is musty, tired, old; it smells of lost dreams and rotten fabric.

> The dreamworld, the dreamtime, the unconscious - call it what you will - is as much part of me as I am part of it.

### Dream a little dream of me

> "Hullo London."
>
> "Hullo John Constantine."
>
> "How are you then, London?"
>
> "All right. Full of people. Raining. You?"
>
> "Aah. Not bad. It's almost lunchtime, so I'm heading into town for breakfast."
>
> "Good idea, John."
>
> "Thank you, London."

好可爱！突然被康康可爱死了，出门吃个早饭，“Hullo London”，没人打招呼所以只能跟这座城市说声早安，孤独但也自得其乐。还有这声“hullo”，直接能幻听出康康说话声音了。以及这上面的一句里直接同时出现了两个标志性用词“bastards”和“bloody”，更是没办法不直接听到康康自己说出这些对话。真是非常喜欢康康的说话风格和声音呢。
