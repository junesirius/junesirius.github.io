漫画真的是一种艺术，文字和画面的表现张力完美介于纯文字艺术的小说和纯画面艺术的影视剧之间，在兼顾文字和画面、动态和静态之间达成一种完美的平衡。但驾驭难度也因此比小说影视剧高出许多，其中一个原因也正是因为，要完成兼顾的效果往往就需要多人的合作，作者与画手、对话框字体设计、排版等等都需要在想象上达成一种统一，于是也难怪优秀的漫画作品也属实极为难得。

### The Sleep of the Just

> I give you the coin I made from a stone.
>
> I give you a song I stole from the dirt.
>
> I give you a knife from under the hills.
>
> And a stick that I stuck through a dead man's eye.
>
> I give you a claw I ripped from a rat.
>
> I give you a name, and the name is lost.
>
> I give you the blood, from out of my vein.
>
> And a feather I pulled from an angel's wing.

连召唤的咒语也美得像诗，又自然地带了一种黑暗感，真是非常适合召唤无尽了。不知道单纯只是写下这些字符，在心里默念，会不会也有一些残余的魔法影响呢？比如并非让梦神来到现实，只是进入我今晚的梦境？

> (tomb: ) Not dead, only sleeping

> Moved to a hospital specializing in encephalitis cases, Ellie continues to sleep. There are many there like her. People for whom **the sand of time** stopped flowing, sometime half a century earlier.
>
> Daniel sleepwalks unspeaking through his world. He moves slowly, like a man wading through **quicksand**.

为什么Dream Lord是sandman？为什么梦和沙构成了联系？为什么梦和死亡同属于无尽，而梦是死亡最小的brother？这段比喻大概已经给出了答案。"People for whom the sand of time stopped flowing", and sleepwalking in the living world is like a man wading through quicksand. Sand, time, dream, life, death，何不就是同一类东西，they all gone fast.

It's almost like a puzzle, to find their connection. And once the missing piece is found, it all feels so right.

### Imperfect Hosts

> The prince of stories.

The Lord of Dream and Nightmare, also the prince of stories. Of course, what else can dreams be other than stories. So every time when I get story inspiration from dreams, I'm actually blessed by the dearest prince of stories. Thank you, love.

> The air is musty, tired, old; it smells of lost dreams and rotten fabric.

> The dreamworld, the dreamtime, the unconscious - call it what you will - is as much part of me as I am part of it.

### Dream a Little Dream of Me

> "Hullo London."
>
> "Hullo John Constantine."
>
> "How are you then, London?"
>
> "All right. Full of people. Raining. You?"
>
> "Aah. Not bad. It's almost lunchtime, so I'm heading into town for breakfast."
>
> "Good idea, John."
>
> "Thank you, London."

好可爱！突然被康康可爱死了，出门吃个早饭，“Hullo London”，没人打招呼所以只能跟这座城市说声早安，孤独但也自得其乐。还有这声“hullo”，直接能幻听出康康说话声音了。以及这上面的一句里直接同时出现了两个标志性用词“bastards”和“bloody”，更是没办法不直接听到康康自己说出这些对话。真是非常喜欢康康的说话风格和声音呢。

### A Hope in Hell

> Tonight I feel alone.
>
> I have always been solitary, but here on the nightward shores of dream, loneliness washes over me in waves, lapping and pulling at my spirit.

Beautiful, something I could steal, or borrow.

> I am a dire wolf, prey-stalking, lethal prowler.
>
> I am a hunter, horse-mounted, wolf-stabbing.
>
> I am a horsefly, horse-stinging, hunter-throwing.
>
> I am a spider, fly-consuming, eight legged.
>
> I am a snake, spider-devouring, poison-toothed.
>
> I am an ox, snake-crushing, heavy footed.
>
> I am an anthrax, butcher bacterium, warm-life destroying.
>
> I am a world, space-floating, life nurturing.
>
> I am a nova, all-exploding, planet-cremating.
>
> I am the universe, all things encompassing, all life embracing.
>
> I am anti-life, the beast of judgement. I am the dark at the end of everything. The end of universes, gods, worlds, of everything.
>
> I am hope.

The famous challenge in hell. I love it so much. So elegant, like poetry.

And a competition of imagination. And for sure, the Lord of Dream will never lose in a competition of imagination.

这一段在剧里的表现力比漫画强得太多，色彩的运用，在对决中的优势劣势交替，每一句“I am”仿佛真的能感受到梦主和路西变成了他们所声称的那些东西，当蛇被牛蹄碾压时路西所受的伤，当宇宙被反物质侵蚀时在地上奄奄一息的梦主，在濒临死亡的那刻用微弱的气息说出“I am hope”，那种在绝境中被希望所拯救的感触，实在非常有感染力，“希望”能战胜哪怕反物质，战胜一切黑暗，而墨菲斯能在地狱获得胜利，唯一所依赖的也只有希望。或许再加一点点想象力，和不多的一些运气。真的非常喜欢了。以及不得不承认，战损的梦主可真是比平时更让人心生爱怜。

> All is real. Nothing is real.

> What power have dreams in hell?
>
> Tell me, Lucifer Morningstar. Ask yourselves, all of you... What power would HELL have if those here imprisoned were NOT able to DREAM of HEAVEN?

If it's not the dreams, if there is no hope, how can we survive this living hell, how can we bear the suffering in the life, and all the pains and hurts and desperations and exhaustions. If it's not the dreams, where else can we escape to, to run away from this world. To know, that things don't have to be like this, that there is always a chance, another world, another dream, that things are different.

### Passengers

> Do you know what dreams are made of?
>
> Made of? They're just dreams...
>
> No. They aren't. People think dreams aren't real because they aren't made of matter, of particles. Dreams ARE real. But they are made of viewpoints, of images, of memories and puns and lost hopes...

Always believe dreams are real, they are what happened in a different universe.

"Are these real or only happen in my mind?" "Happening in your mind doesn't mean they are not real." Just like what Dumbledore said.

> I am a passenger. I am moving through your dreams. I am riding in your dreams.
>
> I ride on dragon back from Manhattan; the dragon is made of rivetted iron and smells of cotton candy.
>
> I travel briefly by bus: in the back the dreamer copulates desperately, not noticing his autonomous passenger. I sit at the front and talk to the driver.
>
> Approaching the state of Delaware, the dreamer is a small dog, dreaming impatiently of a past life, long forgotten, when he sailed tall ships across uncharted seas. The salt spray of the ocean stings my face.
>
> I am moving through dreams, pulling toward Mayhew, feeling for jewel.
>
> Through your dreams, my sleeping children. You had a passenger, and you never knew.

好喜欢这段独白。原来这章标题的“passenger”是这个意思！梦的乘客，在梦之间穿梭行走，好美，也很有诗意。大概也会很像一场冒险，随时都可能因为做梦的人开始想象不同的东西而跟着颠簸，时不时会有些意料之外的风波，也是别有一番趣味。如果能拍出来的话在视觉效果上一定也会很有趣，光是看着漫画和文字已经可以想象到了。

好喜欢那只梦到船和海的小狗，感觉那也是一个故事，有点《一千只猫的梦》的味道。

### Waiting for the End of the World
