## About the Author

Melody Malone is the owner and sole employee of the Angel Detective Agency in Manhattan. She is possibly married but lives alone usually, and is older than both her parents. Sometimes.

Why not visit her website? Ah – probably because the internet hasn't been invented yet. Sorry, Sweetie.

## Chapter 1: The Handsome Client

<u>The sky was the colour of an old church roof</u>, and the rain was giving stair rods a bad reputation.

<br>

But then the sorts of cases I was interested in were rather specialised. Not your run-of-the-mill cheating spouse and missing cat. Or even missing spouse and cheating cat. No, I was more interested in <u>arcane</u>, <u>eclectic</u>, and other words you probably wouldn't expect a New York private detective to use all that much.

<br>

Whoever was <u>loitering</u> outside still hadn't moved on.

<br>

The dark figure of a man stood in the doorway, barely more than a silhouette. But his voice was promising – <u>deep and dark as his shadow</u>.

<br>

I smiled and pushed my <u>fedora</u> up with my index finger so he could see the full extent of my brow. "In the flesh." <u>I lingered on the noun</u>.

I smiled <u>invitingly</u>.

<br>

As he sat, his face moved from the shadows into the light cast by my rather <u>inadequate</u> desk lamp. It didn't help that I'd angled the lamp to show off my own assets rather than his. But I quickly <u>remedied</u> that as I caught sight of the square jaw, the carefully slicked hair, the deep blue eyes, and the Clark Gable moustache.

<br>

I raised an <u>alluring</u> eyebrow. Alluringly.

<br>

There had been reports in the press recently about some of the studio's minor stars defecting to the West Coast studios. No doubt they'd been lured away with <u>lucrative</u> contracts, offers of fame, and <u>the glamour-appeal of Hollywood</u>.

<br>

I leaned back in my chair and adopted an even more <u>nonchalant</u> pose.

<br>

His movie-star face <u>cracked into despondency</u>.

<br>

To my knowledge, Rock Railton had been the top Starlight name for at least two years now, but I didn't <u>quibble</u>.

<br>

"It may surprise you to learn that lots of people hire me to tell them things they already know, Mr Railton." I smiled <u>winningly</u>.

<br>

His moustache twitched rather <u>fetchingly</u> as he smiled.

I smiled back even more <u>fetchingly</u>.

## Chapter 2: Age Before Beauty

<u>Still damp, but not so wet. Though the rain had eased, the streets were puddled and the sidewalks were sweating.</u>

<br>

Perceptive as well as <u>cheeky</u>.

<br>

He nodded knowingly, <u>swerving</u> round a pedestrian.

<br>

I watched <u>the drops paint clear lines down the grubby cab windows</u>.

<br>

But he didn't comment on the money I handed over and was soon disappearing in <u>a cacophony of horn and brake pads</u>.

<br>

I could see the <u>awning</u> further down the street. The remains of the rain was running off it at the edges forming a <u>translucent</u> curtain round the red carpet and uniformed doormen. <u>A trickle of</u> well-dressed people <u>flowed under</u> the awning, doing their best to avoid being dripped on while maintaining their dignity.

Across the street from Nick's was a small park, surrounded by iron <u>railings</u>.

<br>

His voice was <u>a throaty rasp</u> that sounded like it had been through a cheese grater on its way from his larynx to the outside world.

<br>

He threw the money at me, right there in the street. It <u>blizzarded round my head</u>, caught in the breeze and swirling through the evening. People stopped and <u>gawped</u> and grabbed.

<br>

Watched the last hope fade from the old man's eyes as his knees <u>buckled</u> and he fell to the sidewalk. Watched his hand flop into the gutter where the rainwater running into a storm drain washed the dust and <u>grime</u> from his cuffs.

## Chapter 3: Lady Don't Shoot

Rock had already disappeared deep into <u>the melee of guests</u>.

<br>

The waiter holding my coat, and apparently attempting to make eye contact somewhere south of my own jaw, directed me through the large <u>foyer</u> to the ballroom where the party was being held.

<br>

He offered up <u>a silver tray of fluted glasses</u>. "Champagne?"

<br>

He straightened up from the kiss, though that didn't buy him much height, and <u>looked at me askance</u>. "Who's your friend?"

Giddy was giving the lie to her comments about her own acting talents by making a good job of hiding her disgust at the guy's <u>slobbering</u>.

<br>

We reached a <u>secluded</u> corner.

<br>

Kliener had been <u>accosted</u> on the way over by a large gentleman I didn't yet know was Julius Grayle. <u>Corpulent, ageing and corrupt</u> – though I knew only two of those for certain back then, of course. He was gesturing <u>emphatically</u>, while Kliener sneaked <u>furtive</u> and worried glances at me and Rock.

## Chapter 4: Death and Taxis

A <u>brisk</u> walk across town might not be the best prescription for every woman heading home alone. But then I'm not every woman.

<br>

A shadow <u>flitting</u> across a puddle. A distorted reflection in a store window.

<br>

"Mr Kliener," I <u>enthused</u>. "How clever of you to ring my bell."

He laughed his <u>oily laugh</u>. "Didn't know you were a tec."

## Chapter 5: Lights, Camera, Bizarre

Back then, all cars were black<u>. But some were more black than others.</u> The car Max Kliener sent to collect me that afternoon was <u>so black that light seemed to slide off it</u>. The driver wore a dark uniform that looked pale in comparison.

<br>

With the dark-tinted windows and <u>an opaque partition obscuring the driver</u>, I felt like I was being wheeled along in an isolation tank completely cut off from the real world. But New York's a bit like that anyway.

<br>

He had a cigar <u>clamped</u> in his mouth, though it didn't seem to be lit. He removed it to gesture and <u>prod the air</u>, like it was a prop.

When he saw me, Kliener opened his arms and <u>waddled</u> forwards. I avoided an embrace and shook his hand instead. It was cold and <u>clammy</u> and damp, like shaking a fish that's been dead for a couple of days.

<br>

I'm used to being looked up and down but it was still a bit <u>disconcerting</u>. <u>Like meeting your own undertaker for the first time.</u>

"Max Max Max," I <u>reciprocated</u>. "How kind of you to invite me to your <u>quaint</u> little place."

<br>

But I can cope with "strange". It's only when we get to "bizarre" that I start to get <u>tingly</u>.

<br>

Kliener gestured to Rock Railton, <u>beckoning him over</u>.

<br>

She walked up to Rock and Kliener, working her hips so hard she <u>swayed</u> through about twice the distance she needed to travel.

<br>

My brain was working so hard that I barely took in the details. Kliener's <u>voice was an unguent drone</u>. One vast studio looked much like another, even with sets being built or <u>dismantled</u>.

<br>

But I told Kliener: "I never discuss my weight before the third cocktail."

"Maybe I can do something about that," he <u>smarmed</u>.

<br>

Lights were flickering into <u>luminescence</u> all around.

<br>

Leaning against the glass, for all the world like propped-up <u>mannequins</u>, were people.

## Chapter 6: The Soul of Wit

He seemed only slightly put out when I interrupted his <u>spiel</u> to say: "It was you that sent those thugs to kill me last night after the party, wasn't it?"

He opened his hands in a "what can I say" gesture.

<br>

He paused to <u>guffaw unpleasantly</u>. It was the sort of sound a donkey might make if it was in intense pain and beyond embarrassment.

<br>

"But what," I asked as sweetly as I could <u>stomach</u>, "if they don't want to cooperate?"

<br>

His eyes had narrowed so far now that <u>they were in danger of disappearing altogether</u>.

<br>

Giddy's face was drawn and her hair was turning grey. Her forehead was <u>lined</u>, and <u>crow's feet framed her eyes</u>. She looked like she had aged twenty years since I last saw her about an hour earlier.

Her face looked even more <u>wrinkled</u> than it had just moments before.

As we watched, <u>the wrinkles deepened</u>, the flesh <u>sagged</u>, the skin became <u>translucent</u>. Impossibly, she was still ageing.

And in that same short time, the late Giddy Semestre – or whoever she had really been – <u>crumbled to dust</u>. A few moments later, and all that was left was a faint outline on the floor. Even the blood had <u>flaked away</u>, disintegrating to leave only a vague stain.

<br>

I <u>gave up on surprise</u> a long time ago, and I'm not easily shocked. But Kliener's <u>casual viciousness</u> <u>appalled</u> me.

<br>

Giddy <u>slopped out</u>, one slender arm thrown forward, a shapely leg visible where her dress had got hitched up.

She <u>swayed</u> like a sleepwalker, and Kliener supported her – head <u>lolling</u> on his shoulder, his arm round her.

<br>

I turned to Kliener who was watching his latest <u>protégé</u> leave. He looked <u>about ready to bite the end off his cigar</u>, he was so pleased with himself.

## Chapter 7: The Stone Cold Killer

I got ample confirmation of Kliener's complete indifference to irony: when I mentioned the Angel, he looked up at me sharply – and *blinked*. Then, in case I hadn't found that amusing and ironic enough, he did it some more. There was <u>a nervous tick at the side of his eye</u> too. I suspected he wasn't especially delighted at the way I'd <u>stolen his thunder</u>. I was <u>unrepentant</u> – I think he'd stolen more than that in his time.

<br>

The Angel was leaning forward, its <u>chipped wings</u> swept back as if it was moving at incredible speed. Its gnarled, clawed hands stretched out in front <u>like the talons of an eagle reaching for its prey</u>. The stone face was <u>weathered and lined</u>, but twisted into <u>a hideous snarl</u> of anger, rage, and hunger.

<br>

Then another one <u>jabbed</u> a gun so close to my nose I could smell the <u>cordite</u> from its last shot.

<br>

It seemed like there was <u>the ghost of a smile</u> on its <u>cracked stone lips</u>.

## Chapter 8: Angel Kisses

May I have a minute to compose myself before this <u>ordeal</u>?

<br>

Well, excuse me – this was my show. My <u>limelight</u> moment.

<br>

If he thought I was going to stand there <u>meekly</u> and give in to the puckered-lips apocalypse, he was sadly mistaken.

"I'm no angel," I said, and stepped to one side with a neatness and <u>poise</u> that would have impressed a <u>prima ballerina</u>.

## Chapter 9: Closing the Case

But they were all alive and well. They'd not been kissed by an angel, so they'd live full and happy lives. Or as full and happy as fate <u>decreed</u>.
