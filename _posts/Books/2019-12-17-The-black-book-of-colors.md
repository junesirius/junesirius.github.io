## Abstract
(\*in own language)
- Use all the sensing to describe and feel colors, including hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching.


## Notes
- Thomas says that yellow tastes like mustard, but is as soft as a baby chick's feathers. (braille floating feathers)
- Red is sour like unripe strawberries and as sweet as watermelon. It hurts when he finds it on his scraped knee. (braille big strawberries)
- Brown crunches under his feet like fall leaves. Sometimes it smells like chocolate, and other times it stinks. (braille falling leaves)
- Thomas says that blue is the color of the sky when kites are flying and the sun is beating hot on his head. (braille kites)
- But when clouds decide to gather up and the rain pours down, then the sky is white. (braille rain drops pouring down)
- And when the sun peeks through the falling water, all the colors come out, and that's a rainbow. (braille mixture of strawberries, feathers, and grass)
- Thomas thinks that without the sun, water doesn't amount to much. It has no color, no taste, no smell. (braille water, look like waves and spray)
- He says that green tastes like lemon ice cream and smells like grass that's just been cut. (braille tall lawn with flying cut grass)
- But black is the king of all the colors. It is as soft as silk when his mother hugs him and her hair falls in his face. (braille curly hairs that look like both waves and silk)
- Thomas likes all the colors because he can hear them and smell them and touch them and taste them. (braille cutting grass with strawberries, flowers, and a cricket, like spring)
- Braille Alphabet is attached


## Extended thoughts
(\*strengths, weaknesses, future works, relationship with my interests/works, inspirations)
- So breathlessly beautiful, braille alphabets and images on all pages
- Very touching
- Some braille images and alphabets are not convex enough to have a sensitive feeling, not sure if it is due to my lack of training on braille or the problem of the book
- If only by touching the braille, if is still not easy to have a whole picture of the image in mind, understand how it must be difficult for the unseen to sense the knowledge on books and have an understanding of colors
- Extended feeling of me being how lucky to be able to see, hear, touch, walk, etc, which there are so many more disabled are not gifted from birth or was deprived by whatever reasons. So how should I make use of these blessings and cherish them well, as well as my life.
