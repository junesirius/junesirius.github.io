### The Parliament of Rooks

> You'll get a field. Empty. Suddenly the sky is black with birds. And they fall like a ragged black rain onto a field, covering it completely. Or almost completely.

> Why don't you tell him the story about the lily that wanted to be an eye? Or the wolf-boy and his lady-love, and how they made love beneath the moon?
>
> Tell him of the doors in the mist, and how to open them, Or the true title of the knights of the black and white eagle.
>
> Tell him about the girl who could drink only tears, and how she fell in love with a woman who had never learned to cry.
