# Introduction

Liking the person we go on a journey with is the single most important element in drawing us into the story.

<br>

Why is the title "Save the cat"?

The "Save the cat" scene. It's basic. It's the scene where we meet the hero and the hero *does* something -- like saving a cat -- that defines who he is and <u>makes us, the audience, like him</u>.

<br>

**This book is primarily for those who want to master the mainstream film market.**

# Chapter 1: What is it? (Logline)

"pitching" a movie

If you couldn't answer a simple question "What is it," you're toast.

<br>

sequels and remakes, they call them "pre-sold franchises"

A **pre-sold franchise** is something that a goodly chunk of the audience is already "sold" on. It's not that Hollywood is creatively bankrupt; the decision-makers just don't think you out there really, deep down, want to try anything new.

<br>

How are *we* going to come up with something as goo? There is a way. But to try it, need to do something daring. Forget all about your screenplay for now, the cool scenes that are bursting forth in your imagination, the soundtrack, and the stars you KNOW would be interested in being in it. Forget all that.

And <u>concentrate on writing one sentence. One line.</u>

Because if you can learn how to tell me "What is it?" better, faster, and with more creativity, you'll keep me interested. And incidentally, by doing so before you start writing your script, you'll make the story better, too.

## The logline from Hell

a **logline**, or a **one-line**

<br>

What's a good one:

you pick up the trades and read the logline of a spec or a pitch, and your first reaction is "Why didn't *I* think of that?!"

the ones made you jealous

Four components that make a logline a sale: Isn't it ironic, A compelling mental picture, Audience and cost, A killer title

### Isn't it ironic?

The number one thing a good logline must have, the single most important element, is **<u>irony</u>**.

Irony gets your attention. It's *the hook*. It hooks your interest. It's emotionally intriguing, like an itch you have to scratch.

A logline is like the cover of a book; a good one makes you want to open it to find out what's inside.

### A compelling mental picture

The second most important element for a good logline: <u>You must be able to see a whole movie in it.</u>

You see the movie, or at least the potential for it, and the mental images it creates <u>offer the promise of more</u>.

Why "fish-out-of-water" stories are so popular: You can see the potential fireworks of one type of person being thrust into a world outside his ken.

### Audience and cost

Another thing a good logline has, that is important in attracting studio buyers, is <u>a built-in sense of who it's for and what it's going to cost.</u>

<br>

a **block comedy**: not expensive; it takes place on the block, cast and crew barely need to travel

### A killer title

A good logline must include the title. Title and logline are, in fact, the one-two punch, and a good combo never fails to knock me out. Like the irony in a good logline, a great title must have irony *and* tell the tale.

nail the concept without being too on the nose, don't be too generic

The vital, key ingredient of a good title: <u>It says what it is.</u>

## A test marketing example

You can do some test marketing about the logline and title before start creating the story.

<br>

The other great part about <u>road-testing</u> your logline is that you have the experience of <u>all-weather pitching</u>. You pitch to anyone who will stand still, do it in line at Starbucks, do it with friends and strangers, spill guts discussing what you're working on, because: a) anyone having fear that others will steal the idea is an amateur, and b) you find out more about your movie by talking to people one-on-one than having them read it.

## The "death" of high concept

**high concept**: the **one-sheet** (another name for the poster) and you know "What is it" for the mocies

high concept: describe movies that are easy to see

## Summary

elements for a good logline:

1. Irony: must be in some way ironic and emotionally involving -- a dramatic situation that is like an itch you have to scratch
2. A compelling mental picture: must bloom in your mind when you hear it. A whole movie must be implied, often including a time frame.
3. Audience and cost: must demarcate the tone, the target audience, and the sense of cost, so buyers will know if it can make a profit
4. A killer title: must include a great title, one that says what it is and does so in a clever way

## Excises

1. Write loglines for each current and future scripts: Does it make you think of things you should have tried in your script? Does the story have to change to fit the pitch?
2. games to jump-start movie idea skills for a script:
   1. Funny \_\_\_: Pick a drama, thriller, horror movie and turn it into a comedy
   2. Serious \_\_\_: Pick a comedy and make it into a drama
   3. FBI out of water: comedy or drama. Name five places that a FBI agent in the movies has never been sent to solve a crime
   4. \_\_\_ School: drama and comedy. Name five examples of an unusual type of school, camp, or classroom
   5. VERSUS: drama or comedy. Name several pairs of people to be on opposite sides of a burning issue
   6. My \_\_\_ is a serial killer: drama or comedy. Name an unusual person, animal, or thing that a paranoid can suspect of being a murderer

# Chapter 2: Give me the same thing... only different! (Genre)

can be near the cliche, dance around it, run right up to it and *almost* embrace it -- but at the last second you must turn away, give it a twist, put a fresh spin on it

Movies are intricately made emotion machines.

Give your movie a **genre**

To explode the cliches and give something same but different, you have to know the genre and how to invent the twists that avoid pat elements.

## What is it... most like?

After "What is it?" is "What is it... most like?"

types that aren't generic like rom-com, but actually tell you about what the story is
