You're finding out something as you read that will be vitally important for making your way in the world. And it's this:

**<u>The world doesn't have to be like this.</u>**

**Things can be different.**

<br>

As Douglas Adams once pointed out to me, over twenty years before digital books showed up, a physical book is like a shark.

Sharks are old: There were sharks in the ocean before the dinosaurs. And the reason there are still sharks around is that <u>sharks are better at being sharks than anything else is</u>.

<br>

Fiction is the lie that tells the truth.

We all have an obligation to daydream.

We have an obligation to **<u>imagine</u>**.

It is easy to pretend that nobody can change anything, that society is huge and the individual is less than nothing.

<u>But the truth</u> is, individuals make the future, and they do it by **<u>imagining that things can be different</u>**.

<br>

Today I intended to begin to write. *Stories are waiting like distant thunderstorms grumbling and flickering on the grey horizon.*

<br>

Looking back, I've had a remarkable ride. I'm not sure I can call it a career, because a career implies that I had some kind of career plan, and I never did.

The nearest thing I had was a list I made when I was 15 of everything I wanted to do:

To write an adult novel,

a children book,

a comic,

a movie,

record an audiobook,

write an episode of Doctor Who

... and so on.

**<u>I didn't have a career. I just did the next thing on the list.</u>**

<br>

If you have an idea of what you want to make, what you were put here to do, <u>then just go and do that</u>.

And that's much harder than it sounds and, sometimes in the end, so much easier than you might imagine.

<br>

The problems of failure are problems of discouragement, of hopelessness, of hunger. You want *<u>everything to happen</u>* and you *<u>want it now</u>*, and things go wrong.

<br>

**Don't write books just for the money.**

If you didn't get the money, then you didn't have anything. If I did work I was proud of, and I didn't get the money, at least I'd have the work.

Nothing I did where the only reason for doing it was the money was ever worth it, except as bitter experience.

The things I did because I was excited, and wanted to see them exist in reality, have never let me down, and I've never regretted the time I spent on any of them.

<br>

The problems of success.

They're real, and with luck you'll experience them. The point where you stop saying yes to everything, because now the bottles you threw in the ocean are all coming back.

And have to learn to say **NO**.

<br>

Life is sometimes hard. Things go wrong, in life, and in love and in business and in friendship and in health and in all the other ways that life can go wrong. And when things get tough, this is what you should do...

**<u>Make good art.</u>**

<br>

While you're at it, make **<u>YOUR</u>** art. Do the stuff that only **<u>YOU</u>** can do.

The one thing that you have that nobody else has is **<u>YOU</u>**.

Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and **live** as only **<u>YOU</u>** can.

The moment that you feel that, just possibly, **<u>you're walking down the street naked</u>**, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing **<u>too much of yourself</u>**. That's the moment you may be <u>starting to get it right</u>.
