## 原作剧情

1. C：他开始像人一样对我说话而不是发出咯咯的声音，他说自己叫“赫克托”。（最后turns out给他取名的人是我但我不记得了）
2. C：他喜欢用他“人类的嘴”来吃甜食，来品尝它们。他说这跟用他“别的嘴”吃起来味道不一样。
3. D：你已经很久没有正常的人际交往了。
4. E：甜食可以让他平静下来。他吃甜食的时候总是很慢很慢地舔，让糖在他的舌头上融化。而他吃肉的时候会直接打开胸腔上的嘴来一次性吃掉（胸腔里的空间看起来比外面大，他是四维生物？）
5. F2：他总是很饿，像是本能想要吃更多的东西来保持体型来自我保护，是一种防御机制。这很烦人。所以直到他冷静下来，你把他藏在了谷仓里，这样清理那些血和肉会容易一点，他总是吃得乱七八糟。
6. G：他表现得像个人类，举止优雅，让人完全不会怀疑他不是人类。在几次任务中，他都帮你分散别人注意力因为他很擅长跟人搭话。很出人意外的，你们俩组成了一个很好的团队。
7. H：他很黏人，一起出任务时候很话痨，很喜欢没话找话。
8. H：他很容易饿，想问你能不能多出猎几次来满足他对肉的欲望。你不想多接任务因为这很麻烦，你试着给他喂甜食作为替代，因为**上一次**这是奏效的，所以**这次**一定也可以。
9. H：你在自己的日历上开始规律地安排甜食派对。（会邀请其他人一起，然后到最后会把他们也吃掉）
10. I：他很容易饿，你怀疑他可能偷偷背着你在杀戮。虽然你不想让非目标也变成一滩肉因为这很麻烦——好在他什么都会自己处理好。当然，你训斥了他，因为失踪人口也会让当局警觉，让当前任务变得更难。他看上去听懂了，跟你说他会去捕猎一些替代品来满足食欲。你建议他去捕猎动物。周围的熊和野猪不是很多，但是老鼠和野猫还是很多的。
11. J（书虫）：你觉得他在“应该成为”和“想要成为”的形态之间出现了一些冲突（自我认知障碍）。你对这种哲学问题毫不关心，只要他能不留痕迹地把尸体都吃干净。
12. I：在这种形态下，他会把自己嵌在墙里，就像一棵有根的树。他基本上哪儿也不能去，因为太容易惊扰当局（以树的形态出门案例），所以他大部分时间都呆在一个地方。你给他书看，让他在等你带着尸体和证据回来的时间里不会太无聊。让人惊讶的是，即使在这种形态，他对书也很温柔，从来没有折过书页。
13. I：（即使作为一棵树）他也很喜欢甜食作为零食，他会用“舌头”去舔而不是用牙齿。
14. K：尽管他在这种形态，他很安静。他和墙几乎融为一体，看上去就好像你的墙有了眼睛还总是盯着你，这会稍微让人有点背后发毛。但至少他能保护墙不被害虫侵蚀，这是个加分点。
15. L：你看见他开始学着把触手伸到厨房去学烘焙。有一次他不小心把自己烧到了，闻起来像烤牛肉。所以你开始教他做不用火的甜食。
16. M：你注意到他是你家附近流浪汉失踪的罪魁祸首。而他自我辩护说是因为这些流浪汉试图入室抢劫。尽管你完全找不到一点有人想要破门而入的迹象。你谴责了他，他低声哼哼说这是因为他有强烈的不可克制的进食欲望，而且这个形态下自我克制不是很容易。最快的解决方法是让他去野外呆一阵子直到他冷静下来，并寄希望于他不会开始在那儿整个地吞食野生动物……
17. N：他很快地长得超过了建筑和城市，很快所有东西都被他的血肉和触手占满。他的眼睛望着你，在这种形态下很难判断他的神情。他看起来像一株有根的植物。他的牙齿非常轻易地就能把尸体撕成小块然后吞食溶解掉 。
18. N：他用哼哼声说话，你可以在头脑里听到他说自己叫“Hector”。尽管很清楚他可以很容易给自己构造出一张嘴。但看起来他更喜欢用哼哼声来同你交流。
19. N：不管他的形态，他是很安静的。如果你靠得足够近，你可以听到有什么在他的内部跳动，像一颗心脏。
20. N：他让你的任务变得相当简单。他非常轻松地就能定位到你的目标人物，几分钟内他的触手就能带着目标的脑袋回到你的跟前。
21. N：这当然惊扰了当局。他试图与当局谈判，但他们当然不会听他的。所以这些以一场屠杀终结，他吞噬了他们所有人。他自我辩护说他只是为了自我防卫，因为他们试图杀死他。看起来你需要带着他的核心——一团小小的血肉团——远走高飞**从头重新开始**才能避免当局追杀你。在你这么做之前他问你下一次把他养大时能不能给他一些提拉米苏。你当然会说好。况且，你现在也很需要一块提拉米苏。
22. O：当局试图杀死他，但他很快吞噬了他们。你没法指责他的自我防卫，看起来你需要拿走他的由一小团血肉组成的核心，在当局追杀你们两个之前重新开始。
23. P：不管他的体型，他很安静。然后在你意识到之前，整座城市都变得安静了。不是你没来得及及时阻止他吞噬整座城市，就是你默许了让他做想做的事。后者的可能性更大，因为他问过你如果整座城市都没了你会怎么样，而你只是耸了耸肩。然后摸了摸他的头。
24. P：因为他把这里的当局也都吞噬了，不再会有人来告发你。当然除非有从外面城市来的人看见了这个巨大的令人生畏的统治。你在想不知道他到底能长得多大？如果你继续喂他……某种肉类……他会不会吞噬整个世界？而现在，你打算去附近的空甜食店找点吃的。你和你的宠物需要吃点好吃的提拉米苏。（整个城市唯一活下来的人可能是提拉米苏糕点师）
25. R：你的宠物长得很快。太快了，事实上。他超过了建筑和城市。不久他的触须控制了所有的城市、每一片土地和草地。直到在所有的地平线上，你都只能看见熟悉的红色。
26. R：不管他的体型，他很安静。甚至没有人注意到这都是怎么发生的，电视记者甚至没来得及发布消息。你可以听到远处传来的警笛声和尖叫声，而出于某种原因，他从来不会碰你的一根毫毛。他当然不会伤害你。他是一只好宠物。你的好宠物。你不觉得当局现在还有能力来追踪你了，因为他们早就被溶解成了一滩肉糜。但重要的是，现在你可以追踪到你当前的目标，和未来的目标，和未来的未来的目标了，感谢你的宠物。你去取你的报酬，盯着你的眼睛一起眨动着。“看起来我们今晚要去吃牛排了。”你说。你的宠物愉快地哼哼着回应。
27. R2：（统治世界之后）他把自己塑造成人类的外形来见你。他的表情里看不出一点歉疚或者别的什么。他看起来对此感到很愉悦，在期待某种嘉奖。
28. R2：鉴于他把这里的当局也都吞噬了，不再有人来告发你。不再有工作，不再需要交房租。你可以做任何你想做的事。客观地说，当前的目标和未来的目标都已经被追杀了，所以你应该去领赏。你去了最近的甜品店，你的宠物以一种很多触须的样子跟在你后面在地上爬行，然后才回到人类模样。收银员光顾着尖叫和试图爬到柜台上面去躲避那所有肉团。所以你决定自己去取。你们两个一起享用了一块很棒的提拉米苏。（并肩坐在店外面地上一起用同一个勺子吃同一块提拉米苏，看着日落）

（什么任务？）

### 剧情线

1. 相遇：任务出错，心动留下
2. 第一次变成失控的树（中间经历了从小家伙到狗狗到植物的阶段，很多日常；后期控制欲极强时刻监视，Ending N）：不想灭世界不得不灭了它（和当局谈判无果），双方都同意，杀死它，挖心脏重新养（格鲁特一样），死前最后一句“想要提拉米苏”
3. 第二次变成不太走得出去的人样（内向但是饥饿，Ending I/F2）：你因为愧疚（觉得自己不是好主人）所以没有很亲近，也不太喂糖。他总是很饿，甚至偶尔想过要攻击你但是都忍住了。但是有一次还是本性使然把你弄伤了，很愧疚（觉得自己是邪恶的不值得被你关心）而且觉得你不在乎他所以跑出去了，然后把自己弄得半死不活（致命弱点是火），找到时候才知道他是帮忙清除危险去了，然后再次取心重新来，最后愿望是希望下一次对他好一点
4. 第三次变成裹成木乃伊样子的人样（外向，Ending G）：合作执行任务非常顺利，日常生活几乎像是和正常人相处，几乎忘记可能会有的危险，但是仍然因为某些意外能感觉到他不如之前那么强大，喂食也没法彻底解决，开始产生怀疑但是没有确认。遭遇绑架，互相成为对方的弱点，试图互相保护，因为挡刀又死了
5. 下一次再次变成小一点的树（Ending L）：突然觉得其实灭世界也没什么不好的，只要有他在，不管什么形态都没关系。灭世界统治世界了，但是他仍然从一开始的占领世界变得越来越虚弱枯萎，这时候才告知他的重生次数是有限的，已经用完了（暗示第一次见面以前也是见过的），这是最后一次了。这次为了扩张生长消耗得太厉害，已经在衰败阶段了，想要安慰说植物本来就会有这样生死周期的，还是很难过。
6. 结局：抱着剩下的心等着他重生，在旁边睡着了，梦到蹭自己的小狗状态的他（暗示第一次见到的时候就已经不是第一次了，以为失忆的是他其实是自己）
