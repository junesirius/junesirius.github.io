### Ending A: Tiny

You tried feeding your pet. It didn't go as well as you thought. Nothing changed with his size. Well at least he is in opcket size. So you can hide him in your jacket pocket while you look for proper meat for him. You should feed him with more meat if you want him to grew into something big.

You tried feeding your pet. Now he is as a size of a dog. Big enough to eat the corpses but small enough to escape the authority. Although it took him a while to finish his food.

He grow an affection towards sweets. He said something aabout like to eat sweets with his 'human mouth'. Where he can taste the sweets and sugars. He also said it taste different than eating it with his 'other mouth'.

Either from curiosity or pure boredom. He ask couple of time what do you think about white chocolate. He has an interest in cuisine. And maybe start reading about those somewhere.

### 剧情线

1. 相遇：任务出错，心动留下
2. 第一次变成失控的树（中间经历了从小家伙到狗狗到植物的阶段，很多日常；后期控制欲极强时刻监视，Ending N）：不想灭世界不得不灭了它（和当局谈判无果），双方都同意，杀死它，挖心脏重新养（格鲁特一样），死前最后一句“想要提拉米苏”
3. 第二次变成不太走得出去的人样（内向但是饥饿，Ending I/F2）：主人因为愧疚（觉得自己不是好主人）所以没有很亲近，也不太喂糖，总是很饿，甚至偶尔想过要攻击主人但是都忍住了。但是有一次还是本性使然把主人弄伤了，很愧疚（觉得自己是邪恶的不值得被主人关心）而且觉得主人不在乎自己所以跑出去了，然后把自己弄得半死不活（致命弱点是火），找到时候才知道他是帮忙清除危险去了，然后再次取心重新来，最后愿望是希望下一次对他好一点
4. 第三次变成裹成木乃伊样子的人样（外向，Ending G）：合作执行任务非常顺利，日常生活几乎像是和正常人相处，几乎忘记可能会有的危险，但是仍然因为某些意外能感觉到他不如之前那么强大，喂食也没法彻底解决，开始产生怀疑但是没有确认。遭遇绑架，互相成为对方的弱点，试图互相保护，因为挡刀又死了
5. 下一次再次变成小一点的树（Ending L）：突然觉得其实灭世界也没什么不好的，只要有他在，不管什么形态都没关系。灭世界统治世界了，但是他仍然从一开始的占领世界变得越来越虚弱枯萎，这时候才告知他的重生次数是有限的，已经用完了（暗示第一次见面以前也是见过的），这是最后一次了。这次为了扩张生长消耗得太厉害，已经在衰败阶段了，想要安慰说植物本来就会有这样生死周期的，还是很难过。
