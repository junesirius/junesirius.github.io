"How does it feel?" She asked, looking him in the eyes.

"How does what feel?" Hook raised one eyebrow.

"You know, after you..." Emma found it still so hard to say the word "die", so she said, "after you got stabbed."

"Ah that, " Hook's eye showed a flicker of realization, and then quickly moved aside, then move back, "nothing. Actually I don't really remember." He said.

Emma knew he wasn't telling everything. She knew that face, he would do that every time he was holding something back.

She sat closer to him, put her hand on his chest, near his heart, and near the place she knew where the sword went through. She could feel the beating beneath her palm, it felt warm and strong, and made her feel so relieved, but now it's beating a little faster than usual.

She slightly pressed there, as if can still see the hole from the sword, as if trying to stop blood from flowing out. She can still see his eyes from back there, and see the lights go out from his beautiful black pearl-like eyes.

"Everyone remembers what happened in that world," she said, almost whispering, their foreheads were just inches away, "so I know you must remember. I just want to know, what happened, how that feels like. I don't want you to have to live with that all alone, Killian."

Hook swallowed quickly, his breath was shallow. She waited patiently, she knew he's thinking. In the end, he started talking, also in a really low voice, "You wouldn't want to know."

"Tell me." She insisted. _Something_ must have happened there when she wasn't there, when no one was there, when he was lying on the ground by himself, when life was leaving him. She couldn't bear to imagine, but she wanted to hear him say it.

"It's like, sinking into the sea." He started slowly, she reached out to catch his hand, held it with both her palms. "Everything starts getting colder, and darker, and emptier. At first I didn't feel the pain, but then it comes to here." He raised his hook to indicate his heart. "I didn't check the wound so I don't know what it looks like from outside, but I can feel my heart beating fast, like a dying seagull or some birds. It feels... hollow, and cold, like there is nothing there, nothing in the world would ever make me feel warm or happy again."

"Oh Killian..." Emma raised a hand to touch his face trying to comfort him, she already regretted asking him to relive that moment again.

"I tried really hard to remember your face at that moment." He continued, saw her worrying face and tried to smile a little to cheer her up but it didn't seem to work. "But even that memory was fading fast, one moment your smile is in front of me, the next it's all gone, everything gets swallowed by the blackness and emptiness. The air feels too thick to breathe, and the blackness, it's like the water you saw from the bottom of the sea, just coming closer and heavier from everywhere. You know there is no way out, you know it's going to get you sooner or later, and there is nothing you can do to avoid it..."

"I'm sorry Killian, I really am, I don't mean to..." Emma felt so bad for bringing it up, "you don't have to recall that moment if you don't want to..."

"No, Swan, actually, I want you to hear this out." Killian said, looking at her now with a small smile, rubbing her face gently with his fingers, "I wasn't afraid at that time, I knew I was there all alone and fading, but I wasn't lonely. I was imagining this world, the world you and I right now are, I didn't know or remember anything about this world back then but I sort of also already knew everything deep down. I knew you will always eventually find happiness, you will get what you want as you always will, I knew that even though that me wouldn't see or come to this world, but the other me will be with you. You see, it's hard to tell the difference between that world and this one for me actually, here I am, and I am him, so I never died, in a way..."

"Did I just make it too complicated?" He stopped, saw her frowns so he asked with his eyes.

Emma just couldn't move her eyes away from his face. "No no," she said, "not at all. I was just thinking..." It hurts her so much to think of it this way.

"Thinking what, love?"

"That it means you did die once, everything happened, it's real for you, as far as your memory is concerned. Which means I actually left you all cold and alone there to bleed out and die, and didn't even come back to check you out, because I thought that wasn't real, and I was wrong. How could I put you through all this..." Emma's face looked so painful now, tears were fighting to come down.

"Hey, hey, but it's alright now, love." Killian didn't expect to see her tears, hurriedly wiping her tears and decided the best way to persuade her that things are ok now is to kiss her, so he did just that, and it worked.

The warm soft feeling of his lips made her feel a lot better now, she could put her mind back to the conversation they were having just now. With her head on his shoulder, her palm on his heart, she was picking her words carefully, "So it does hurt..."

"But it doesn't matter..."

"Shhh let me finish. I promise, Killian, I will _never_ _ever_ _**ever**_ let that happen to you again. I don't think I can bear to see that again in front of my eyes."

Hook smiled. "And I promise the same. You wouldn't see it again, good that I'm a survivor. And I certainly wouldn't allow you to experience anything like that. Now, shall we go to the Granny's for dinner?"

Emma raised up her hand from his shoulder, wiped her tears, and turned into a large smile, "I would love that."

<br>

Destiny would know, maybe, or maybe not, one of them would break the promise, one way or another, when the time comes. But before the sound of the black wings covers the sky, they still have plenty of time to do everything they would like to do. And right now, that thing is just an ordinary meal together, at an ordinary diner, in an ordinary day. Maybe this day they just stopped another villain's evil plan, but it doesn't matter, and it counts as an ordinary day anyway.
