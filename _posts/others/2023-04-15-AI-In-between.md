Some key points fed to AI before starting the writing:

- A close friend expresses romance interest and the receiver is hesitant and contradictory.

- The reason of hesitation and contradiction includes:
  - Value that friendship too much and don't want to risk losing it if things don't work out
  - The friendship might become distant by itself anyway given the career plan, so might as well proceed to give it a try
  - Fear close relationship: last one ends badly and not dare to start a new one for a very long time
  - But do desire to have someone and experience romance again, has been fantasying it
  - But still not feel confident to enter a new relationship again, not sure is able to do it right
  - Might should work with some counselors, but still find it very difficult to trust them and be open to them, so doesn't work well with them
  - Unsure of own sexuality, consider oneself bisexual but also possible to be homosexual which means might not able to develop in the direction of romance
  - (There are also concerns about immigration and religion and cultural difference, which is added along the way)

```
Make all these feelings above a part of an emotional journey of a story, create a story outline out of it.
```

> Here is a potential outline for a story based on the emotions and experiences you described:
>
> Title: The Journey Back to Love
>
> Act 1: The Set-Up
>
> - Introduce the protagonist, a person who has been single for six years and is hesitant to enter a new relationship due to past hurt
> - Establish the protagonist's desire for love and romance, but also their fear and anxiety about entering a new relationship
> - Introduce the close friend who expresses romantic interest in the protagonist, but who the protagonist is unsure about pursuing due to fear of losing the friendship
> - Establish the workplace setting where the protagonist and close friend work together and plan to leave the company soon
>
> Act 2: The Journey
>
> - Show the protagonist seeking professional help from a counselor to work through their fears and build confidence
> - Illustrate the challenges the protagonist faces in opening up to the counselor and trusting them, but also the progress they make in building a therapeutic relationship
> - Show the protagonist starting to date again, but taking things slow and being honest about their fears and concerns with potential partners
> - Depict the protagonist's growing feelings for their close friend, and the internal struggle they face in deciding whether to pursue the relationship or not
> - Show the protagonist grappling with the possibility of losing the friendship, but ultimately deciding to take a chance on love
>
> Act 3: The Resolution
>
> - Show the protagonist and close friend navigating the new romantic relationship, with ups and downs along the way
> - Illustrate the protagonist's continued work with the counselor to address any issues that arise in the relationship and to build a stronger sense of trust and confidence
> - Depict the protagonist's growth and healing through the emotional journey, and their ability to fully embrace love and romance again
> - End with the protagonist and close friend leaving the company and starting a new chapter of their lives together, stronger and more in love than ever before.
>
> Overall, the story would be a journey of growth, healing, and taking risks despite fear and uncertainty. It would highlight the importance of seeking help and support, being honest about one's feelings and concerns, and ultimately following one's heart towards love and happiness.

(Too straightforward and realistic, don't like it.)

```
Don't make this story so realistic and so straightforwardly from reality, transform it to be more dramatic, cinematic, and maybe even some absurdity here and there, make it a romcom movie script style.
```

> Title: Love in the Workplace
>
> Opening: The camera pans through a busy office floor. We see people typing away at their computers and talking on the phone. We focus in on our protagonist, JESSICA (late 20s), who is staring off into space. Suddenly, her phone rings, and we see her jump.
>
> ACT 1: Meet Cute
>
> Jessica picks up the phone, and we hear a cheerful voice on the other end. It's her friend, MIKE (late 20s), who she's worked with for years. Mike has always been a great friend to Jessica, but today he sounds different. He confesses that he's always had a crush on her, and he thinks they should give it a shot. Jessica is taken aback, but also intrigued. She agrees to go out with him.
>
> ACT 2: The Struggle
>
> Jessica and Mike start dating, but things get complicated quickly. They work in the same office, and they're both planning on leaving soon. Jessica starts to worry that if things go wrong, it will ruin their friendship and make work awkward. She confides in her therapist, Dr. Jones (40s), who encourages her to take a chance on love.
>
> Meanwhile, Jessica and Mike's co-workers start to notice that something is going on between them. One of their colleagues, MELISSA (late 20s), is particularly interested in their relationship. She starts to drop hints that she's interested in Mike, and Jessica starts to worry that she might lose him.
>
> ACT 3: The Grand Gesture
>
> As Jessica's anxiety about their relationship grows, Mike decides to make a grand gesture to show her how much he cares. He surprises her with a romantic picnic on the rooftop of their office building. Jessica is overwhelmed by his thoughtfulness and starts to let her guard down.
>
> Just as things seem to be going well, Melissa shows up on the rooftop. She reveals that she's always been jealous of Jessica and Mike's friendship and that she's been trying to sabotage their relationship. Mike is shocked and hurt, but Jessica realizes that she trusts him completely. They share a tender moment, and Mike confesses that he loves her.
>
> ACT 4: Happily Ever After
>
> Jessica and Mike leave the company and start their own business together. They face plenty of challenges, but they're able to work through them because they trust each other and have a deep connection. In the end, they're happier than they ever thought possible. The final shot is of them walking hand in hand into the sunset.
>
> Closing: The camera pans out to the city skyline. We hear a romantic song start to play as the credits roll.

(Still too straightforward, old-fashioned, cliché, and predictable)

```
How would Woody Allen write it?
```

> Opening: A montage of bustling New York City streets, with jazz music playing in the background. We see Jessica (late 20s), walking to work, coffee in hand. She's dressed in vintage clothing, and she's lost in thought. Suddenly, she bumps into a man (late 20s) on the street. They both drop their coffee, and their eyes meet. The man is Mike, and he's charming and witty. Jessica is immediately smitten.
>
> ACT 1: Witty Banter
>
> Mike and Jessica start working together at a small advertising agency, and they're constantly bantering and flirting with each other. They're both afraid to make a move, but their colleagues can see that they have feelings for each other.
>
> ACT 2: Misunderstandings
>
> Just when it seems like Mike and Jessica are finally going to make a move, misunderstandings get in the way. Jessica thinks that Mike is only interested in her as a friend, and Mike thinks that Jessica is seeing someone else. They both start to distance themselves from each other, and their colleagues start to worry that they'll never get together.
>
> ACT 3: The Big Gesture
>
> In a last-ditch effort to win Jessica's heart, Mike decides to stage a flash mob in the middle of Times Square. He serenades her with a ukulele, surrounded by dancers and musicians. Jessica is overwhelmed by his gesture, and she finally confesses that she has feelings for him too.
>
> ACT 4: The Obstacle
>
> Just when it seems like Mike and Jessica are going to live happily ever after, an obstacle gets in the way. Jessica's ex-boyfriend, a wealthy Wall Street banker, shows up and tries to win her back. Mike starts to feel insecure, and he starts to doubt whether he's good enough for Jessica.
>
> ACT 5: The Resolution
>
> In the end, Mike and Jessica overcome their doubts and insecurities. They realize that they're meant to be together, and they decide to start their own advertising agency. The final shot is of them walking hand in hand down the streets of New York City, surrounded by the people they love.
>
> Closing: The jazz music swells, and the credits roll. The camera pans out to a shot of the New York City skyline.

(The misunderstanding part, and distance themselves from each other, and the big gesture of ukulele in Times Square, and the ex-boyfriend plot, these does feel like Woody Allen, but still not what I want)

```
There have been far too many rom-com like this before, make it somewhat different from the cliché.
```

> Opening: The camera zooms in on a girl in her late 20s, walking through the busy streets of New York City. The jazz music starts to play, but suddenly the camera shakes and we hear a record scratch. The camera pans out and we see that the jazz music is actually being played by a street performer (Mike) who just tripped over his ukulele.
>
> ACT 1: Unconventional Beginnings
>
> Mike and Jessica start working together at a small advertising agency, but instead of immediately falling in love, they can't stand each other. Jessica thinks Mike is annoying, and Mike thinks Jessica is a stick in the mud. But as they work together on a project for a quirky client, they start to see each other in a different light.
>
> ACT 2: Unexpected Surprises
>
> Just when it seems like Mike and Jessica are finally going to make a move, unexpected surprises get in the way. Jessica's ex-boyfriend (a struggling musician) comes back into town, and Mike's estranged father shows up to reconcile with him. The two of them start to pull away from each other, and their colleagues start to worry that they'll never get together.
>
> ACT 3: The Grand Gesture
>
> In a moment of inspiration, Mike decides to organize a guerrilla advertising campaign for Jessica's favorite charity. He enlists the help of all their coworkers, and they end up taking over the entire subway station with their message of love and hope. Jessica is overwhelmed by his gesture, and she finally confesses that she has feelings for him too.
>
> ACT 4: Facing Fears
>
> Just when it seems like Mike and Jessica are going to live happily ever after, they both start to get cold feet. Mike has never been in a serious relationship before, and Jessica is afraid of getting hurt again. They both start to doubt whether they're ready for this kind of commitment.
>
> ACT 5: The Unexpected Twist
>
> In the end, Mike and Jessica overcome their doubts and insecurities. But instead of starting their own advertising agency, they decide to pack up and travel the world together. The final shot is of them sitting on a beach in Bali, watching the sunset and planning their next adventure.
>
> Closing: The jazz music starts to play again, but this time it's a reggae version. The camera pans out to a shot of the beach, and we see Mike and Jessica laughing together as the sun sets behind them. The credits roll over shots of them exploring new places and having adventures together.

(Still quite cliché, just this time they start as people who don't like each other.

Far too many poor artists/musicians in one movie.

And not really a big fan of the big gesture part.

Still want to experiment with something even more different.)

```
Make it not in real world and current time, add something fantasy in it.
```

> Opening: The camera zooms in on a girl in her late 20s, walking through a bustling market in a magical kingdom. The music starts to play, but suddenly the camera shakes and we hear a strange noise. The camera pans out and we see that the music is actually being played by a group of fairies (Mike) who just crashed into a fruit stand.
>
> ACT 1: Unconventional Beginnings
>
> Mike and Jessica are both from different magical kingdoms, and they meet by chance when they end up attending the same enchanted advertising academy. Despite their initial dislike for each other, they are assigned to work on a project together for a whimsical client. As they work together, they start to see each other in a different light.
>
> ACT 2: Unexpected Surprises
>
> Just when it seems like Mike and Jessica are finally going to make a move, unexpected surprises get in the way. A powerful sorcerer comes into town, and he's looking for a magical apprentice to join his team. Jessica is chosen as the chosen one, and she's forced to leave the academy to begin her training. Meanwhile, Mike discovers that he's actually half-human, and he must learn to navigate his newfound identity.
>
> ACT 3: The Grand Gesture
>
> In a moment of inspiration, Mike decides to use his half-human abilities to help Jessica defeat the sorcerer and save the kingdom. He enlists the help of all their friends, and they set out on an epic quest to find the magical artifacts they need to defeat the sorcerer. Along the way, they realize that their feelings for each other have grown stronger than ever.
>
> ACT 4: Facing Fears
>
> Just when it seems like everything is going their way, Mike and Jessica both start to get cold feet. Jessica is afraid of the responsibility that comes with being the chosen one, and Mike is unsure if he's ready to give up his human life to live in the magical kingdom. They both start to doubt whether they can make their relationship work.
>
> ACT 5: The Unexpected Twist
>
> In the end, Mike and Jessica overcome their doubts and insecurities. Together, they defeat the sorcerer and save the kingdom. But instead of staying in the magical world, they decide to travel to the human world to experience new adventures together. The final shot is of them walking hand in hand through the busy streets of New York City, with a sense of wonder and excitement about the unknown future ahead of them.
>
> Closing: The fairy music starts to play again, but this time it's a rock version. The camera pans out to a shot of the magical kingdom, and we see Mike and Jessica flying off into the horizon on a magical carpet. The credits roll over shots of them exploring new worlds and having magical adventures together.

(Seriously? "enchanted advertising academy"? Literally translated New York City to a random magical kingdom with no other change?

The discovery of his hidden new identity part is not too bad. Could try explore something similar.

Why does it have to have a big bad wolf-style villain (the evil sorcerer) to mess up this supposedly already struggling enough rom-com story backbone?

Oh wow the final shot does feel unexpected, walking back to New York City? Combining magical kingdom with real human world? Now it feels like Once Upon a Time now.

A rock version of fairy music... feels like a bad salad that mixed and ruined both veggie and good salmon.

Alright this experiment isn't very successful, fantasy doesn't really work out, let's try something else.)

```
Try again, this time not in fantasy land, set it in some historical time and places.
```

> Opening: The camera pans over the city streets of Paris in the 1920s, capturing the sights and sounds of the roaring twenties. A beautiful young woman, Sophie, walks through the crowded streets, heading towards her job as a seamstress. She bumps into a young man, Jacques, on the way, and they share a brief moment of eye contact before going their separate ways.
>
> ACT 1: Chance Encounters
>
> Sophie and Jacques keep running into each other around the city, and they strike up a conversation about their shared love of literature and art. Despite their different backgrounds (Sophie is from a working-class family, while Jacques comes from a wealthy family), they find that they have a deep connection and decide to go on a date.
>
> ACT 2: Society's Expectations
>
> As they continue to see each other, Sophie and Jacques start to face pressure from their families and society to conform to their expected roles. Jacques is expected to marry a woman from his social circle, while Sophie's family wants her to focus on her career. They both struggle with these expectations and wonder if they can find a way to be together despite the obstacles.
>
> ACT 3: The Grand Gesture
>
> When Jacques is called away to serve in World War II, Sophie decides to use her skills as a seamstress to help with the war effort. She starts designing and sewing uniforms for soldiers, and in the process, she discovers a new sense of purpose and passion. When Jacques returns from the war, he's impressed by her work and realizes that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her.
>
> ACT 4: Facing Fears
>
> Despite their love for each other, Sophie and Jacques are still afraid of the consequences of being together. They both worry about how their families and society will react to their relationship. They decide to take a break and think things over, but they realize that they can't live without each other.
>
> ACT 5: The Unexpected Twist
>
> In the end, Sophie and Jacques decide to take a risk and be together. They move to a different part of the city where they can start fresh and build a life together. They face challenges and setbacks along the way, but they never lose their love for each other. The final shot is of them walking hand in hand through the streets of Paris, with a sense of freedom and hope for the future.
>
> Closing: The camera pans out to a shot of the Eiffel Tower, and the credits roll over shots of Sophie and Jacques living their life together and pursuing their passions. The music is a jazzy rendition of "La Vie en Rose," capturing the spirit of the era and their love for each other.

(1920s Paris, the golden age, of course, the best place for a romance story in the whole world in the whole history.

The names, Sophie and Jacques, do sound like 1920s Paris. AI is doing a really good job picking names that fit the setting time and place, it seems.

"Keep running into each other," perfect example of lazy plotting: too many coincidences. Shouldn't have more than one.

Pressure from different class, family, society circle, not really new, but easy to connect, could consider add that element.

World War II, nice touch. Wasn't thinking about that when reading 20s Paris but guess it does get close enough in timeline.

The emotional journey always has to be: remote -> emotionally close -> disturbed by external factor -> resolved, brief peace (middle point/fake ending) -> disturbed by internal factor -> resolved, real ending. A little bit too textbook-like, or industrial running assembly line taste.

Got curious about the very specific music "La Vie en Rose", went to listen to it, terribly old (in other words, classic jazz), like, granny-old feeling.

Not exactly able to echo the whole emotional journey, not the feeling I want. Not a too successful experiment, go back to the very first version.)

```
ok I still prefer modern time New York setting.
```

> Sure, here's an updated version with a modern-day New York setting:
>
> Opening: The camera zooms in on the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, capturing the sounds and sights of city life. We see a young woman, Emily, rushing to her job at a publishing house, carrying a stack of manuscripts. As she crosses the street, she bumps into a young man, Liam, and drops her papers.
>
> ACT 1: Chance Encounters
>
> Liam helps Emily pick up her papers, and they strike up a conversation about their shared love of books and writing. They discover they have a deep connection and decide to grab coffee together. As they continue to see each other, they realize they have feelings for each other, but are hesitant to take things further due to past heartbreaks.
>
> ACT 2: Society's Expectations
>
> Emily's boss, a high-powered editor, wants her to focus solely on her career and not get distracted by relationships. Liam is also feeling pressure from his friends and family to settle down with someone who fits their expectations. Despite the challenges, they decide to take things slow and explore their feelings for each other.
>
> ACT 3: The Grand Gesture
>
> When Emily's company decides to publish a book by a famous author, Liam suggests they take a chance and reach out to the author to see if he will work with them. The author agrees, and Emily and Liam end up collaborating on the book together, which becomes a bestseller. This shared success brings them even closer, and they start to see a future together.
>
> ACT 4: Facing Fears
>
> As their relationship deepens, Emily and Liam start to worry about what the future holds. They both have been hurt before and are hesitant to take a risk on love again. However, when Emily's ex-boyfriend shows up, begging for another chance, Liam realizes he can't let her go and decides to make a grand gesture to show his commitment.
>
> ACT 5: The Unexpected Twist
>
> On a beautiful spring day in Central Park, Liam gets down on one knee and proposes to Emily. She is overjoyed and says yes. However, as they celebrate their engagement, they receive unexpected news that Liam's dream job is in another city. Emily is torn between her love for Liam and her career in New York. In the end, they decide to take a risk and move together, starting a new life and career in a new city.
>
> Closing: The camera zooms out to a shot of the New York skyline, and the credits roll over shots of Emily and Liam starting their new life together. The music is a modern, upbeat love song that captures the energy and excitement of their new adventure.

(Manhattan feels better than New York City, though technically no difference, but sounds better. Probably just because more familiar with it.

Oh my god, rushing in the street and bump into the future love interest again, kill me if I have to see another movie like this, exactly the same as thousands of other movies from twenty years ago. (That's what the audience will feel like as well.)

Just another cliché. But guess it's also somewhat normal considering it's what AI currently do: learn from what has been done, and do it in a similar way. Nothing too creative (yet).)

```
Don't make the external obstacle come from family and class, the female is an alien to the country and need to work hard to earn the immigration status, the male is from Europe and a catholic family.
```

(my bad, pick the bad word "alien" and a little bit too specific about religion here, but later realize that's another good entry point to explore.)

> Opening: The camera pans over the New York skyline and focuses on a bustling coffee shop in Brooklyn. We see a young woman, Maya, working behind the counter. She's an alien from a distant planet, struggling to find her place on Earth.
>
> ACT 1: A Chance Encounter
>
> One day, Maya meets a young man, Luca, who is visiting New York from Europe. They share a love of coffee and music, and soon begin to spend more time together. Maya is hesitant to reveal her true identity, but Luca is drawn to her unique perspective on the world.
>
> ACT 2: The Immigration Struggle
>
> As Maya falls deeper in love with Luca, she also faces the challenges of navigating a new country and trying to earn her immigration status. She works multiple jobs and attends school at night, all while keeping her true identity a secret from her employers and colleagues.
>
> ACT 3: The Catholic Family
>
> Luca's family is deeply religious and traditional, and they have high expectations for their son's future. When they learn that he is dating an alien from another planet, they are initially hesitant to accept Maya. However, over time, they begin to see her kindness and hard work, and their attitudes start to shift.
>
> ACT 4: A Dangerous Discovery
>
> As Maya's immigration status becomes more precarious, she fears that her true identity will be discovered. She confides in Luca, who is shocked but supportive. However, when Maya's alien powers are accidentally revealed during a heated argument with a customer, they both realize that they must leave New York to avoid being discovered by the government.
>
> ACT 5: The Final Decision
>
> Maya and Luca decide to leave New York and start a new life together. They travel across the country, taking odd jobs and experiencing new adventures. However, as they near the Canadian border, they realize that they must make a final decision: go north and start a new life in Canada, or risk everything to stay in the United States.
>
> Closing: The camera zooms out to a shot of the open road, and the credits roll over Maya and Luca driving off into the distance. The music is a mix of indie and electronic, capturing the sense of adventure and uncertainty that lies ahead for the couple.

(Maya the alien and Luca the cute handsome young tourist, now it feels like cheap 80s European midnight rom-com soap opera that only middle-age housewife would watch.

Poor young woman works multiple jobs and attends school at night, feels like another cliché 60s character design.

Actually, dating an alien being a challenge to the religious belief might actually be funny and interesting to see and develop. Would they think of her as a hidden devil or descending angel or something similar?

The struggling decision at the border, that small moment I actually liked, could change to Mexico, feels like the Star Ending of Cyberpunk 2077, the moment of breaking out of the wall and enjoying the free wind of the outside. And better not giving any hint of how the story really will end, leave the readers/audience to wonder.)

```
Alien as in from another country, maybe asia, not from another planet.
```

> Opening: The camera pans over the New York skyline and focuses on a bustling coffee shop in Brooklyn. We see a young woman, Maya, working behind the counter. She's an immigrant from Asia, struggling to make ends meet in a new country.
>
> ACT 1: A Chance Encounter
>
> One day, Maya meets a young man, Luca, who is visiting New York from Europe. They share a love of coffee and music, and soon begin to spend more time together. Maya is hesitant to reveal her true identity as an undocumented immigrant, but Luca is drawn to her warm personality and unique perspective on life.
>
> ACT 2: The Immigration Struggle
>
> As Maya falls deeper in love with Luca, she also faces the challenges of trying to earn her immigration status. She works multiple jobs and attends night school, all while keeping her undocumented status a secret from her employers and colleagues.
>
> ACT 3: The Cultural Divide
>
> Luca's family is from a wealthy, Catholic background, and they have high expectations for their son's future. When they learn that he is dating an undocumented immigrant from Asia, they are initially hesitant to accept Maya. However, over time, they begin to see her hard work and determination, and their attitudes start to shift.
>
> ACT 4: A Dangerous Discovery
>
> As Maya's immigration status becomes more precarious, she fears that she will be discovered and deported. She confides in Luca, who is shocked but supportive. However, when Maya's undocumented status is accidentally revealed during a heated argument with a customer, they both realize that they must leave New York to avoid being deported.
>
> ACT 5: The Final Decision
>
> Maya and Luca decide to leave New York and start a new life together. They travel across the country, taking odd jobs and experiencing new adventures. However, as they near the Mexican border, they realize that they must make a final decision: risk everything to cross the border and start a new life in Mexico, or return to New York and face the consequences of Maya's undocumented status.
>
> Closing: The camera zooms out to a shot of Maya and Luca standing at the Mexican border, facing the uncertainty of their future together. The music is a mix of indie and electronic, capturing the sense of adventure and uncertainty that lies ahead for the couple.

(hardworking Asian girl trying to earn her future and immigration status... cliché *and* stereotype.

The final shot of looking at the border trying to decide which side is the actual freedom, still feels intriguing. And the open ending, leaves the story unfinished, could leave people thinking after story ends.)

```
What's Maya's nationality? (create one yourself)
```

(take a break from the world building and plot planning, take a moment for character designing, hope there is something good or at least better than the above plots.)

> Maya is from the fictional country of Juvia, a small island nation in Southeast Asia known for its vibrant culture and stunning beaches. Despite its natural beauty, Juvia is plagued by political instability and economic hardships, which drove Maya to leave her homeland and seek a better life in the United States.

(Not terribly bad, island nation in Southeast Asia, sounds like a country in NationStates.)

```
Where is Luca from? (create one yourself) (know that his native language is Spanish)
```

> Luca is from the fictional country of Castellano, a charming coastal nation in Europe known for its colorful architecture and rich culinary tradition. Castellano is a small but proud country, and its people are fiercely loyal to their heritage and traditions. Luca grew up in a close-knit community where everyone knows each other, and his family has a long history of producing skilled artisans and craftsmen. As a native Spanish speaker, Luca effortlessly blends in with the vibrant and diverse culture of New York City, where he now lives and works.

(Not too bad, but also, randomly created character isn't that easy to make it wrong.

"effortlessly blends in": this emphasize seems suspicious, feel a little to deliberate.

```
Suggest some more names for them including first name and last name, all better to have some meaningful meanings and reflective of their origins and maybe personalities.
```

(Full space searching, trying to get all the combination and find some good names.)
