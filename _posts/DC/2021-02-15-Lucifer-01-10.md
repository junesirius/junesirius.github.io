> You guys sound just like me and my dad. We used to fight all the time over the dumbest stuff. That's why I left.
>
> But no matter what I did, I couldn't get away. Because every time I cooked a meal, or I looked in the mirror, there he was staring back at me.
>
> **Because he's a part of me.**
>
> He may have pushed too hard, and tried to make me something I'm not.
>
> **But in the end, it made me the man I am.**
>
> And I'm proud of who I've become.
>
> \- Lucifer: He didn't escape his father because he turned into him.

> That ungrateful kid did not deserve this place. He was given everything, and he threw it all way. But it didn't matter, 'cause he was still the favorite.
>
> \- Because he was worthy of his father's love. And he had a chance at redemption until you ruined it.

> Look, I know I haven't always been the easiest mom. I could be pushy, overbearing. I am sorry that you felt that you always had to be the adult. All I ever wanted was for you to be happy.
>
> \- I know.

> Lucifer: We don't all turn into our parents. I mean, look at me, I don't think I've ever been the son that he wants me to be.

daddy issue：永远会戳到我的topic

或许也是路西法的故事之所以这么抓住我的心的原因（之一）了吧。

以及这剧本是真的不错，把三个父子/母女的故事相互穿插在一起，又不显得违和或者突兀（虽然在回过头来的时候还是会感觉得到编剧是刻意这样安排的，说明还是能感受到一点点突兀，但是在看的时候感觉还好）。

最喜欢其中心理医生的片段（似乎最近看过的所有电视剧都是差不多套路了，用一个个独立案件推进主线剧情，用心理医生来让主要人物说出内心真话，毕竟对于很多人来说似乎这种场合才是真诚的，符合套路的剧包括《黑客军团》《汉尼拔》等等），以及这个心理医生Linda Martin的话术和水平是真的高，尤其从上一集跟Maze的对话和各种其他场合也能看得出情商也是真的高。

（偏题了，）所以在这里一个印象非常深的点是，小哈维尔说他在自己身上看到的都是父亲留下的痕迹，而他也为现在的自己感到骄傲。于是这不能不让我想到，我现在仍然无法跟过去的自己和解，没法真正跟childhood memory或者daddy issue和解，是否也是跟没法认可现在的我自己有关。

这也又回到第六第七集探讨的问题了，在路西法找自己丢失的翅膀时候Linda问的“Who are you? Your identity. Who do you want to be?”那些身份认同的问题了。毫无疑问，我的self-identity问题也仍然是一团混乱的。或许等到我终于能理清这些问题，真正接纳我自己的时候，一切就会豁然开朗了。
