> God: Choice is a funny thing. Give someone different options, different circumstances, will they themselves end up different?
>
> Sure, they might end up with a different job, find inspiration from different people. But will they still be the same person at their core?（Ella）
>
> Some might continue down a darker path, never knowing there was a different way. The potential buried deep down, but still there.（Maze）
>
> Some make immoral choices instead of moral ones, but they'll still have the same conscience. The question is, will they ever make the choice to listen to it?（Linda）
>
> And sometimes, it isn't the right moment in someone's life to make a certain choice. And no matter how badly you want to nudge them in the right direction, you know they need to find it on their own.（Amenadiel）
>
> And some people find love in the strangest of situations, and are somehow, happier for it.（Dan和夏洛特）
>
> And some, no matter how you shake things up, end up making the same choices, and drawn to the same people, the same passions.（Lucifer和Chloe）
>
> So all seems to have ended well. Does that mean I never should've manipulated things to begin with?
>
> I have a better question: Wouldn't you do the same in my shoes? After all, a parent just wants what's best for their child.

很有意思的平行世界梗，plus（几乎）全员恶人梗，plus全员演员梗

（as much as I want，2077的全员演员梗已经有人写过了，确实是为数不多可以把很多刀和玻璃渣圆回去的梗了）

bonus episode的特质非常明显了，也很高兴编剧终于善良了一下给Dan和夏洛特一个在平行世界里的好结局了。

以及最后的那个结论，非常发人深省：God didn't do anything. Whatever happening, is exactly what needs to happen. We choose what kind of life we live, not God. God is not manipulating anything. Nor does anyone else in our live.

PS：这个版本的平行世界看起来确实似乎还不错，但唯一的问题就变成了：Chloe是用女儿换了父亲。如果父亲不死，她就不会遇上Dan，不会有Trixie。对于一个女儿兼母亲，这个选择确实也实在太艰难了一点。

PPS：上帝的配音也实在太年轻了一点……吧？
