> There was this soul that I used to torture back in Hell. And like a good masochist, he'd call the shots. "Burn me." "Freeze me." "Hurt me." So I did. 
>
> And this went on for centuries, until one day, for some reason, he missed his daily punishment. 
>
> And when I returned, he was crying. "Please, my king," He said, "Don't ever forget me again. I promise I'll be good."
>
> It was then that I realized he was so full of self-loathing, void of any self-respect, that no matter the depth of my cruelty, whatever miniscule attention I paid gave meaning to his pointless existence.

老路，你何必又用这种伤人的话语试图推开任何靠近你的人，你的detective，你的brother，你的doctor，你又在推开他们，试图用伤害和恶毒来证明你从来没有变好。你想要找回原来的自己，by embracing the old devilish self，哪怕曾经的你拒绝那时的自己，而现在的你也在拒绝接受现在的自己。

拒绝接纳自己，huh，那不也完全就是我自己一直以来对自己的态度。我又有什么立场去说老路呢。
