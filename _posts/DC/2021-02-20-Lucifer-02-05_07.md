### S02E05 What does the God want

> You know that's not what your Father wanted.
>
> \- Do I?! Everyone thinks they know what he wants. Amenadiel did when he first got here, now Uriel does. Human wars have been waged because of it. 
>
> \- Dad showed me an open door. Does that mean I was meant to take you back to Hell, or was he insinuating that Hell was getting drafty? Nobody bloody knows because the selfish bastard won't just tell us! And I'm sick of it. No more. No more.


### S02E06 self-destruction

looking for punishment

wanted to be punished for what he had done

even though it's not his fault

a new feeling, a feeling he never felt before: guilt

Whose fault is it then?


### S02E07

> \- How do you know what (job) feels right?
>
> \- You just know.

> The last person I opened up to, I hurt. A lot. Let alone how I've hurt my own flesh and blood. It's all I seem to be able to do.
