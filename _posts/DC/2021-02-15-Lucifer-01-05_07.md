### S01E05 上帝情结

> I think I just figured it out why you do these favors.
> 
> It's about power.
> 
> It makes you feel superior. In control.
> 
> You're addicted to creating chaos and seeing where the chips fall, to hell with the consequence.（你迷上了制造混乱，看事情发展，毫不管后果。）
> 
> It's like you have some kind of god complex.（就像是你有上帝情结。）


### S01E06 丢翅膀（身份认同）

> Your identity. Who are you trying so hard to become?
> 
> You keep trying on many hats to hide your horns. Playboy, cop, club owner...（你一直都在用很多身份去掩盖你的真实面目。浪子，警察，酒吧老板……）
> 
> One of the hardest things we ever do is learn to be ourselves. I want you to tell me who you believe is the real you.

——————

> Every culture in the world and throughout history, for that matter, has its very own myth of the Devil.（世界上所有文明从古至今都有关于撒旦特有的神话。）
> 
> But the one thing that they all have in common is that the Devil is essentially a rebellious son.（但他们的共通之处在于，撒旦在本质上是个叛逆之子。）

——————

> Sometimes we need to lose something before we can understand its value.
> 
> And often, our feelings of loss connect to how we feel about who we are.
> 
> Before you fell, you were known as Samael. The Lightbringer.
> 
> \- I don't go by that name anymore.
> 
> That was a name that connotated your father's love for you.（那名字代表着你父亲对你的爱）
> 
> \- Right. Was casting his son into Hell also an expression of his love?
> 
> God didn't cast you out of Heaven because he was angry with you.
> 
> \- How can you presume to know God's intentions?
> 
> Oh, I don't. I can't.
> 
> \- Then may stick within the limits of your intellectual capacity.
> 
> Oh maybe my simplicity offers me a different perspective. God cast you out because he needed you to do the most difficult of jobs. It was a gift.
> 
> \- Gift? He shunned me. He vilified me. He made me a torturer!（他驱逐了我，让我成为恶人，拷问者！）
> 
> \- Can you even begin to fathom what it was like?（你能想象这是种什么感觉吗？）
> 
> \- Eons spent providing a place for dead mortals to punish themselves?（永世管理一个死去凡人惩罚自己的地方）
> 
> \- I mean, why do they blame me for all their little failings? As if I'd spent my days sitting on their shoulder, forcing them to commit acts they'd otherwise find repulsive.
> 
> \- "Oh, the Devil made me do it." I have never made any one of them do anything. Never.
> 
> What happened to you is unfair.
> 
> \- Unfair? This is unjust. For all eternity, my name will be invoked to represent all their depravity.（永生永世，我的名字便永远代表着他们犯下的所有罪恶）
> 
> \- This is the gift that my father gave me.
> 
> It was an act of love.
> 
> \- How do you know?
> 
> Because you are his favorite son, Samael.
> 
> \- Do not call me that, please!
> 
> You are his fallen angel. But here's the thing: **When angels fall, they also... rise.（当天使堕落时，他们也在重生）**
> 
> All you have to do is embrace all that you are.（你要做的就是接受原本的自己）
> 
> \- I can't.
> 
> Yes, you can. You just have to be open to the process.（只要你愿意接受）
> 
> \- You don't understand. I can't!
> 
> Why not?
> 
> \- Because they stole them from me!


### S01E07 找回翅膀（找回身份认同）

> Well, clearly you were desperate. I mean, you were willing to let a human die and unleash the wings upon the world just to remind me who I was, to fool me into desiring the wings, and the hellish throne they accompany.
> 
> Well, do you know what? It almost bloody worked.
> 
> Severing the wings was a half measure, I did leave myself an out.（当时锯掉翅膀确实是冲动之举，我确实给自己留了一条后路）
> 
> A rip cord back to the life that dear old Dad chose for me.（让我还能有机会过回老爹给我选择的人生）
> 
> But I don't need it now, because, in case I haven't made myself abundantly clear, I'm never going back to Hell.

——————

> The wings are old news now.
> 
> In my search for the wings, I realized what they actually were.
> 
> A relic worth exactly what someone were willing to pay for them.（这种神物的价值只在于你愿意为它付出多少）
> 
> I've moved on to bigger and better things.
