我走进一家宠物店，里面有各种猫狗宠物。外面在下雨，我就想我不能带那些毛茸茸的宠物出去了，它们很容易被淋湿又不容易干，所以我去看冷血动物了。我看见一只蜥蜴，但是我把笼子打开以后它就跑掉了，沿着墙爬上去爬到我够不着的地方了。还有一个我一开始以为是空的玻璃盒子，我打开把手伸进去以后发现里面有条蛇。

（英文版本：）

I was walking into a pet store, there were all kinds of dogs and cats. It was raining, I thought I couldn't take fluffy animals because they would easily get wet and difficult to dry, so I was looking for some cold-blood animal. I saw a lizard, but it ran away and climbed onto the wall after I opened the cage. There was a thought-to-be-empty glass box, I opened it, put my hand in it, then I noticed there is a snake in it. Then I woke up.
