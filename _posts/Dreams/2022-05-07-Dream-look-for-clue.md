六个人一组，一起参加一个游戏。一起被传送到一座荒山上，要求在一个小时之内找到一具尸体和六条用来找出他死因的线索。还要及时找到传送回来的入口，那个入口会精准地在一个小时时间到了的时候开启唯一一次，没有及时被传送的人就会永远被留在那里。

这座山上有很多树，地上铺满了厚厚的落叶。我们手头的工具只有两个灯泡，转一下底座就会亮，不用另外插电。但是如果亮很久都不关的话就会很变得很烫，会拿不住。我们被警告过如果拿不住掉到地上的话，它可能会把落叶点燃，之前就有一组把落叶点燃然后把整座山都烧掉了。所以我们学乖了，提前准备了厚布条缠住底座（也是握着的地方），这样既能全程亮着来找东西，也不会因为太烫握不住。（之后好像温度还是透过布条让手指觉得烫了，所以又用一件衣服把底座又裹了更厚的一层。）

然后就是我们几个人一起分散在山上开始找线索，尸体还是很容易找的，但是带着尸体一起走就会走得很慢。好在我们这些人都是很聪明的人（就像上次办公室去玩密室时候感觉到的那样，大家真的都是很聪明反应很快的人），在落叶底下或者树里或者别的地方的线索都被找到了，也知道了死因（但是我忘了），但是时间也剩得不多了，我们还没找到传送回去的入口。

到最后我们终于在山坡最高处的落叶底下找到了一个圆圈，觉得这应该就是传送口，但是我们也只有一次机会尝试，所有人都很紧张。而且因为我带着尸体走得最慢，眼看着时间就要到了我还没跑到那个地方。他们所有人都已经站在圆圈里准备好了，在朝我挥手大喊叫我快跑，我在拼命往那里跑，能感觉到计时（或者倒计时）在很响地滴答滴答地走，然后我刚好在最后一秒终于冲进了圆圈踩进了一只脚，他们其他人抓住我的手帮我保持平衡。然后传送就启动了，我们被传送到了一个同时像水族馆和博物馆的地方。

里面有很多大大小小的水缸和模拟水下环境的布置，有些能看见鱼，中央一个很大的里面有虾和很多珊瑚。有很多游客在观赏，边上有保安和导游之类的各种工作人员。我们的下一个任务是要从场馆里搜集线索来找一个对接的人，把尸体和死因都交接给那个人。场馆里有很多非常不值得信任的人，如果我们找错了人我们就screw up了。

然后我们就像之前一样开始分散观察找线索，我在很认真地观察中间的那个大水缸。然后我觉得线索可能会在水下，就直接跳进水缸里了，潜泳地游下去到水底去找。水底的珊瑚被干扰了以后突然就变得非常活跃，像藤条一样疯长起来把我手脚缠住。我想跑，但是它们疯长的速度比我在水下跑的速度快。然后我听见外面有人在做动作给我比划游泳的动作，说它们讨厌这个动作。我就开始做划水动作，然后它们真的放开我了。我终于能浮到水面上了。（但是之前在水下我好像也没有呼吸困难什么的）

（之后好像还有一点水下的剧情但是我忘了，然后就醒了。希望我们找到了正确的交接人。）

（带着尸体回去这个点有点像塞德里克，落叶很厚的山有点像哈七或者惩罚者里的画面）

（英文版本：）

A group of us was forced to play a game. We were transported to a mountain, we had one hour to find a dead body and six clues to find out the cause of his death, and then had to gather in another transport circle which would be activated only once precisely when the hour ended. So anyone who didn't make it to the transport location in time would be left behind forever.

The only tool we had were two light bulbs which could be turned on and held in hand (without extra electricity), but if it was turned on for too long, it would become extremely hot and impossible to hold. And if we drop the light when it's hot, it would ignite the falling leaves on the round, potentially burn the whole mountain.

Fortunately, all six of people in my group were clever people, we found clues really quick, but unfortunately, the mountain area was so large, we couldn't find the end transport circle, and carrying a dead body slowed us down a lot.

When we finally found the transport circle, we only had several seconds left, and I was the one at the last of the team. The circle was on top of the hill. They all stood in the circle waiting and shouting at me, I was running towards them, there was also a large count-down somewhere. I really thought I wouldn't make it, but I made it, at the last second.

As soon as I stepped into the circle, time was up, it was activated and we were transported to another place that looked like an aquarium museum. I could see shrimps and coral in the closest tank. Many visitors and staff were walking around. The new task was to find more clues in the museum to know among those people, who was trustworthy and who were not. We needed to find the trustworthy person to give him the body and tell him the cause of death that we found. If we told the wrong person, we were screwed.

We suspected some of the clues might be inside of these tanks under water, so I jumped into the water and looked for clues. Corals didn't like to be disturbed, they started to move and grow towards me and chase me, I heard someone shouting about swimming with a specific posture to run away from them, so I did as told, and it worked and I swam away.

(Can't remember what happened next, I'd rather believe we find the right guy and win, instead of finding the wrong guy and died. End of story/end of dream.)
