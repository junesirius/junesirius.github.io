有一场大考试，我已经快要迟到了，然后想起来我忘带笔了，就回去拿，回来快到考场了然后又想起来也忘带草稿纸了，就又回家去拿。然后终于进了学校，一个志愿者跟我说我的考场在三楼，但是我怎么也找不到去三楼的楼梯或者电梯。

（英文版本：）

I was about to have a big exam. I was already almost late, and I remembered forgetting to pack my pen so I went back to get it. Then remembered forgetting draft paper, and went back home again to get it. Then I finally arrived at the school, a student volunteer told me my classroom/exam-room was at the third floor, but I couldn't find where were the stairs or elevators to go there.
