在空难现场（因为昨天睡前看了MU5735飞机失事的新闻），站在一个山峰上，看见飞机残骸在后面不远的山坡上，大部分被树木植被遮住了，但是基本能看出整个都支离破碎了。舱门开了，里面有很多骷髅在往外爬，已经看不出人形了。我就站在山峰上这样看着。

然后有一对母子，瘦得不成形，问我有没有吃的。我手里有很小的半碗米饭，明显不够他们两个吃，母亲说都给孩子吧，我用筷子努力扒拉扒拉把半碗饭分成1:2，三分之一给母亲，三分之二给了男孩。

（英文版本：）

Dreamed about an air crash, probably because of a news I read before sleep last night.

I remembered standing on a mountaintop, the plane crashed in front of me, skeleton were crawling out of the plane asking for help and I was just too scared to move.

There was a mother and a boy, still in human-shape, asking me for some food. I only had half a bowl of rice, not enough for both of them, the mother said give all of them to the boy, but I still managed to split the rice to 2:1, so the mother could also have something to eat.
