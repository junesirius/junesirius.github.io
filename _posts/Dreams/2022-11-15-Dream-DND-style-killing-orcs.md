我和几个人一起在讨论战略布局，我和另一个男生会先进去攻击作为诱饵，等奥克被我们引出洞穴，另外两个队友就能进去偷什么东西还是救什么人。我说别让我们在外面等太久，不然诱饵就要被吃掉了。

然后我们就进去了，我很安静地挥剑在砍奥克，完全没说话。一个人走过来跟我说：“No no you're doing it the wrong way.”

我一下子理解了，知道这里打架的规则是一定要边打边描述的（有点像现实版DND），说：“Oh I forgot the narratives, didn't I?”

他说：“Yep, you need to describe what you do, can't just do it.”

我就开始一边说“我举起了剑”一边举起剑，继续这样边描述边打。

（英文版本：）

I was with a few other people and we were having a strategic positioning, me and another boy will go ahead and attack as a bait, once Orcs are led away from their cave, two other teammates will go inside steal something or rescue someone. I told them not to let us hang on too long otherwise the "bait" will get eaten.

So we went in, I was fighting them with my sword silently. Another guy walked towards me and said "No no you're doing it the wrong way."

I said "Oh I forgot the narratives, didn't I?"

He said "Yep, you need to describe what you do, can't just do it."

So I started to say "I raise my sword" while raising the sword etc.
