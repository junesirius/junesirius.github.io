碎片1：

我：“朔月是满月”，朔的象形字是弯月里一个圆，所以朔是满的意思

爸：其实月才是满月的意思

碎片2：

想要拯救“猫猫死囚室”（让死囚来照看猫猫，发现他们都被感化，但是即将被关停），计划是找死神帮忙。为了把死神叫出来所以跟一起执行计划的同伴驾车出游（我在副驾），然后故意出车祸，同伴受伤严重将死，死神出现（麻袋死神和睡魔死神的结合体，很多程度上更像墨菲斯），像熟人一样交流，开始我们的游戏，死神：“我知道他的习惯，会在车上留线索告知他是谁”，如果我在死神之前找出线索就能暂时让他（和我？）不死。

我在驾驶座下面找到一本掉落的杂志，翻开发现是剧本，左边一个对话里出现人名“Ronald，……”我说我找到了，他叫Ronald。死神认输暂时不带走他，我：“I want to make a deal with you”（想要借助死神力量让普通人看见一点死亡，让他们的求生欲来理解死囚，让猫猫死囚室继续开下去）

<br>

碎片2的英文版（包括一些故事脑补）：

I had a favor to ask Death, so I deliberately had a car accident, the driver was dying, Death came and we talked like old friend, Death said he knew people always leave clue behind about who are they, if I find out who the driver is before Death, he could live and Death would listen to my deal. I found a magazine beneath driver's seat, inside it's actually a movie script, in one of the pages the character's conversation mentioned a name "Ronald", that's the only name in the whole script. So I told Death I found the clue, the driver is called Ronald, so Death lost our little game and asked why I want to see him.

I told him there is this "death sentence, but with a kitten" program I want to save, it's a kitten shelter and also a condemned cell, criminals who are convicted to death sentence will take care of abandoned kittens. I believed this is best for both but the program is going to be shut down. I asked if Death could help me save it by showing people what Death could do, and how it gives life meaning and why that program is important. I think Death agreed, and that's when I woke up.

Come back to the dream, I didn't kill Ronald lol, he's the driver and if anything, he made it happen, and from my knowledge, he is also in some way similar to me or also a part of some group I'm in, which means he was also an old friend with Death or at least has met/talked with Death before, and I'm actually not sure if that little "find the hint and name" game is meant to be between me and Death or him and Death, or three of us? because Death knew his habit of hiding the name, so more like their routine when they met before, but somehow this time I'm competing it. So the car accident is mostly just his/our way of contacting Death and we know what we're doing.

（脑补部分：）

I can almost also imagine if it's an actual story how it would go. Before the mission we would discuss the plan and talk over it, we say the best way might be to let Death prove the value blabla. And then I would ask "but how are we going to contact Death?" He'd say "I know a way." He would say he's confident he can control the speed and things to make sure we're right on edge of living and dying, not too far to die but also enough to let Death come and show up. I would oppose it immediately, say it's too dangerous, he could actually be taken away by Death, I can't let him sacrifice. He'd try to comfort me "but that's the only way", all other ways are less efficient and we might be too late to save those condemned criminals from being executed. And he'd say we can propose a game with Death, make it a competition between Death and me, and the reward is his life. I'd be too worried that I might let him down but he'd say he trust me, he always do. So then we went on the road and ran into the accident as planned and as the start of the dream goes.
