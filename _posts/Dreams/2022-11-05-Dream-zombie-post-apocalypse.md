（有点混乱有点害怕但是还挺好玩的梦）

梦到我和几个人一起被传送到了一个有点像后末日的世界/星球，落地的地方像是一个废弃的学校，非常荒凉破败。建筑主体结构都还在，墙什么的都还立着但是就是脱落破败了，桌椅铁栏杆什么的都生锈蒙灰了。我们一开始是在二楼的一条走廊上，虽然没有人类活动踪迹但是还是非常小心猫着腰端着枪很警惕地在移动，直觉里感觉会被什么敌人看见会受到攻击。

然后我们有人感觉到隔着一个回廊的对面二楼有敌人注意到我们了虽然我们还没看见对方，就像游戏里一样我的视角边缘出现了一个红色箭头，会自动指示敌人方向。我就往地下室/一楼方向跑，顺着楼梯往下。我感觉这座学校的结构我都很熟悉，很清楚知道走廊和楼梯都在哪里，就像我之前就是在这里上学一样。

然后顺着楼梯跑到一楼，跑到一个像是之前的车库的地方，现在也是都废弃了，我感觉从车库深处方向又有了一个新的红色箭头，表示那里也有敌人，我就继续往外面跑。连着车库的外面是一片绿化很好的草坪，也有很多树和很高的灌木，就像那种废弃很久没人管的野生草地经常会长成的那种wild的样子，中间有一条人工铺的路，就是在废弃之前让学生穿过草坪的石头路。但是跟我记忆里不一样的是这条路两边现在都立着很高的铁丝网，只留出中间很狭窄很狭窄的一条能同行的路。

我直觉地感觉这两边的铁丝网肯定是为了拦什么东西但是我暂时还没看到，这条路刚开始走我就开始感觉很紧张，觉得有事会发生或者已经发生了。

然后我就看到了铁丝网上挂着僵尸，零零散散仍然保持着扑过来的姿势，但是都没在动，我很紧张不知道他们会不会在感觉到活人气息以后重新活过来还是已经被一劳永逸地用某种办法（直觉感觉是跟魔法或者核爆炸有关）让他们消停了。

就这样提心吊胆地继续走（现在倒是没有红色箭头了），然后前面有一个小小的转弯，在转弯地方有更多的凝固点僵尸，看起来完全就像是这里原来的学生和老师（所以就确定了这个后末日世界就是经历了僵尸世界末日），扑上来的人数也更多，层层叠叠的。

有一个把手伸进了铁丝网的洞里，几乎能碰到在这条小路上走的幸存者了，我手贱地用手里的枪戳了一下，结果那节铁丝网就直接很脆地倒下去了（因为铁丝网也都是锈迹斑斑很久的样子了，之前只是因为没人碰所以勉强立着，但是我没想到），吓得我心跳都要停了，因为现在跟那些外面的僵尸直接面对面了，虽然他们仍然没动，我还是感觉他们随时会跳起来。

我试着想把倒下去的那节铁丝网再拽回来让它立着但是很明显立不住了，所以只能就这样了，然后继续心惊胆战地往前走。

（忘了说我自己视角的左上方有个小地图，这个和刚才的红色箭头其实都是原神游戏界面，但是第一人称进入世界以后就感觉好像直接是在我视网膜上显示的（或者眼镜上）

然后我这个时候在小地图上看见右上方有个蓝色感叹号，表示那里有一个任务领取（更像游戏了），我就往那边走。找到了的感叹号的地方仍然是在草坪上，走完了那条石头小路，右边跟教学楼相邻，地上有一块很大的石板，上面刻着学校地图和校徽校训什么的。石板右上角有一个三个红色按钮，有点像一个问题三个选项，第一个是“毁灭学校”，最后一个是“毁灭世界”。

我直觉知道要领取和完成这个任务（消掉这个蓝色感叹号）就要按第一个按钮，我感觉我右边有个站着的男的（是跟我一起来的同伴）在看着我，等着我按。而且我也知道现在这里大概没什么剩下的了，但是又担心因为我们没认真搜查过每间教室万一里面还有活人活物怎么办，所以我就按不下手。就是手指悬在按钮上，非常纠结，然后说“I can't.”

（后面还有两个很碎的画面跟前面剧情连不起来

一个是在一辆感觉像很小的旅游巴士上，大概能坐十个人左右，身边都是熟悉的朋友同学。我坐的位子面向左边车窗，我对面坐着一个认识的男孩子，穿了一件蓝色（还是粉红色？）羽绒背心。外面现在是晚上。然后我们的巴士在穿过一条看起来很热闹的商业街，透过车窗能看见很多沿街的商店橱窗（有点像纽约的观光巴士），然后我指着一个橱窗里跟他同款的羽绒背心说“看来这款衣服真是在全宇宙都很流行”。当我说全宇宙的时候其实就是非常清楚知道我们现在所在的这个星球其实不是我们自己的星球，但是也差不多一样繁华宜居，我们就是来观光（顺便完成任务？）的。（在这个世界观下我们去另一个星球就像现实里去另一个国家或者城市）

另一个记忆碎片是我坐在一个教室很靠后的位子，我左边的椅子是面朝教室后面摆的，坐着一个看起来很邋遢的老巫师，白色长发长胡子但是都看起来很脏打着结什么的（有点像大力环里那位）但是我也没嫌弃他，就是很熟地聊天开玩笑问一些问题（具体聊了什么刚醒的时候还记得然后就很快忘了）。

（我好喜欢僵尸和铁丝网围着的小路那段，很紧张但是还挺精彩的。

（我其实好想知道我们前面在走廊和地下室碰到的红色箭头指示的敌人到底是什么，但是都没看见，应该不是僵尸吧，直觉感觉可能是竞争部队之类的。

（好多僵尸层层叠叠扑在铁丝网上那个画面我觉得是因为被昨天看的《和平使者》trigger了《僵尸世界大战》的记忆。

（英文版本：）

It was a game-like zombie post-apocalypse.

We arrived at a deserted school, everything looks super old, the walls were collapsing, the iron bars were rusted, no living thing in sight.

We investigated and searched very carefully and cautiously, as if we knew there would still be some enemies. At one point, I could see a red arrow at the edge of my eyesight (just like some game interface), indicating direction of unseen enemies. We didn't engage, just silently and secretly ran away, so I still didn't know if they were zombies or just other troops or something.

Outside of the school building was a lawn with a small trail in the middle. The lawn was just like any lawn without attendance, trees and bushes and grass grew very tall. On the both sides of the trail, there were high wire fences, obviously was trying to keep zombies out for human to run away from the trail.

There was a blue exclamation mark on my eyesight on a mini-map at the corner of my eyesight, indicating the position for a new mission location. So I walked on the trail towards that direction. Nothing special on the trail at the first part, but I still walked very stealthly with a rifle ready in hand. And then I saw zombies on the outside of the wire fence, not moving, but keeping their posture of leaning on the fence trying to reach their hands towards inside.

I was worried they might come back to active again once they saw me but they didn't, I intuitively felt some magic or nuclear explosion had stopped them but I couldn't be 100% sure whether they would move again or not.

The farther I walked the more zombies were outside of the wire fence, they looked like mostly were infected teachers and students, layers and layers pushing themselves towards the fence. At one point I was just so curious that I had to use the gun to poke at one of the dead zombies that was closest to me and its arms were through the wire fence's holes. And then a large part of fence just fell down, I obviously forgot the fence was also ages old and rusty, it was just merely standing, any touch or shake would make them fall down.

Now I was face to face with tons of dead zombies, just inches away, still not 100% sure if they would come to attack me. I got super intense, still rifle ready and be prepared, but they didn't move. Looks like whatever happened here before has neutralized them for good.

And then I arrived at the mission location. There was a large tilestone with school map and badge and motto carved on it. On the right top corner of it, there were three big red buttons, each with an action item, and now I knew this was the mission option. The first button said "destroy the school", the third one was "destroy the world" (don't remember the second one, probably something in between).

I knew I was supposed to press one of the buttons. There was another guy who I knew we arrived together as a team standing besides me right now, looked at me, waiting for me to press the button and finish the mission.

I hesitated, I knew it's likely there was nothing left in the school to be reluctant for, all living thing must have all died, but somehow I had some nostalgia feeling about the school (I think it is my school, which explains why I know all the building structure and secret paths so well). And I reasonified to myself by thinking that we haven't examined the whole school in and out, we didn't actually know if there was anything or anyone left.

So I just couldn't do it, couldn't really press the button to destroy the school even if it's all dead zombies now. My finger was suspending on the button, and I just said "I can't."
