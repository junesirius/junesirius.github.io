我出了事故，被紧急送到医院动手术，主刀医生是我妈。我到的时候还有点意识，然后开始手术以后就black out了，等我醒来以后已经在正常病床上了，手术已经做完了。

然后我看我枕头旁边有一张donor information的卡片，是一个白人中年男人的驾照，意思是他刚刚出车祸了，他的器官被移植给我了。然后有人告诉我刚才做手术打开我身体以后看见里面几乎空空如也，什么器官也没有，只有一颗心脏，也不知道为什么我还一直正常活着。我妈就把donor的肾和肝给我移植过来了，别的器官以后等有合适的会再给我做手术。

我就掀开被子看，发现肚子上装了拉链，胸腔也很容易用手打开，我就拉开看了。看见里面有一个肾一个肝，血管已经跟别的血管接起来了，就是我妈刚才缝合的。

我说我不想要别人的器官，这会让我血里有第二套基因，为什么手术之前不问我，我知道我把那些器官放哪里了。之前做生物课作业时候我把自己胸腔腹腔打开过了，左手拿着那些器官右手照着它们样子画下来写作业，然后做完以后觉得没什么用就放在一个盒子里了，心脏也是拿出来过了的，想想这个可能确实有点用就又放回去了。如果大家都觉得肾和肝还是有用的，我就把盒子拿过来让我妈放回去好了，可能有几根血管要缝。

听我说这些的人是个跟我家很熟的黑人记者，这个时候正好是准备来采访我。然后我就是当着他的面把身体里别人捐献的器官拿出来的，还能记得手里红色一捧肉的感觉，但是没有血。

然后我想要从床上爬起来，因为我想在一会儿另一场手术之前上个厕所，一边想把自己撑起来一边叫那个记者可以走了。他本来坐在我床右边，这时候转到左边想来帮忙扶我，我又说了一遍让他走，说的是英语“you can go now, I don't want you see me like this, I'm not in my best self.”他就收回手走了。

然后我妈终于被护士叫过来看我了，她刚才在给别人做手术。我跟她说我要去厕所，就一个人捂着肚子去厕所了，开始觉得有点不舒服。然后听见护士在问她我没有这些器官是怎么一直活到现在的，尤其是我还把心脏也拿出来过了，那时候血管里血是怎么流的，氧气怎么送到四肢，为什么没有立刻手脚冰凉。我妈说她也不知道，可能血管里还有残留的血和残留的氧气够支持一会儿，正常人可能只能支撑几秒，我体质特殊可以撑比如三十分钟，然后也是会手脚冰凉晕过去或者死掉的。

然后我在厕所听见这些就感觉果然好像手脚变凉越来越不舒服，然后就醒了（果然那个我black out或者死掉了）。

（突然就觉得这段很像封神榜比干的那个“菜无心能活，人无心呢”妲己：“人无心必死”然后他就倒地而亡

（前面那段左手捧着器官右手写作业的画面也有点像V的Crime of the Future

（那些器官捧在手里手感有点像超市买来的牛肉牛肝回来洗的时候那个手感

（我梦里觉得还挺对不起我妈和那个donor的，觉得他们捐献了器官还好不容易给我缝进来，但是因为没提前问我，被我醒来以后因为不喜欢不想要扯掉了，浪费器官浪费刚才手术effort，我还挺怕我妈生气

（梦到donor那个证件完全就是因为在网上搜驾照sample时候看见过好多不同sample，好多都有donor标志，就有想过要不要自己也register那个donor program

（这个梦里其实用到了一个谐音梗。我说我把那些器官放在了chest里，护士说不在胸腔里，我说这个chest我指的是盒子，不是胸腔。好像也可以奇怪地解释了为什么不在胸腔里也没事，因为仍然在chest里，身体以为那就是还在（突然觉得可以用这个搞一个设定，感觉也可以写得有点悬疑/惊悚/奇幻风/尼尔盖曼风，标题就叫《The Chest》）

（这个故事的英文版：）

I had some accident and was sent to hospital for surgery, the surgeon was my mom. I still had some consciousness when I was on that kind of emergency wheel bed, could feel the nurses running along the corridor and pushing me to the surgery room, and then I blacked out.

When I came to conscious again, I was lying on a normal hospital bed, the surgeon was finished. I saw there was a small card by my pillow said "donor information", with photo of a white male, meaning this man was just in a car accident and his organs were transplanted to me.

And then some nurse came to tell me that when they did the surgery, they cut open my chest and abdomen, and they found almost no organ in there, it's almost all empty, only has a heart connected to the blood vessel, and they had no idea how I can survive for so long and live normally. My mom looked for donors and found this man has fit kidney and liver for me, so she transplanted those, the rest need to wait until there are fitting organs and donors.

So I sat up and looked at my stomach, found there was a zip there, I guess it's easier for follow-up operations. I opened it and found the kidney and liver were sewed with the blood vessels, I said "I don't want other people's organs, that would make my blood have two sets of genes, why don't you guys ask me whether I want other people's organ or not, because I know where I put my organs."

I remembered some time ago (and I had visions of these flashbacks) when doing my biology homework, I opened my chest, my left hand took my liver, kidney, and heart out one by one, and my right hand drew those organs down for the homework. After I'm done, I thought they don't have much use so just lock them away in a chest, only with the heart I thought it may actually be useful so I put it back inside the body. I told them about these, and said if everyone thought liver and kidney are also useful, I can bring the box and put them back, maybe still need my mom to sew some blood vessels together.

While I was saying those, there was a black male sitting by my bed and I know he's a family friend, that's why he's the only reporter who's allowed inside the room to see me. All this time he just sat there and looks considerate. After I finished talking I told him "you can go now, I'm going to grab those outsider organs out of me, I don't want you to see me like this, I'm not in my best self." He was just about to help me sit up, after hearing that he left.

Then I actually started putting my hand inside my body and grabbed organs out. I could feel the red flesh shaped like liver and kidney on my palm, they feel warm and tender, not bloody, actually no blood at all in the whole dream. And I actually feel bad and really guilty doing that, because I was thinking it must take my mom quite some effort to sew them together, now that I destroyed her effort she might be mad at me.

And then my mom finally came over to see me, nurses called her earlier but she was doing some other surgeries for other patients. I told her I want to be prepared for another surgery and need to go to the bathroom before that. So I went alone, and started to feel unwell, I overheard a nurse ask her how did I live without those organs, especially I had taken the heart out too, at that time how does the blood flow, where is the blood oxygen come from, how is oxygen transferred to the body and limbs, why I'm not immediately cold in hands and feet. My mom said she didn't know, maybe I'm special so the existing blood oxygen could support for like half an hour without a heart, but if the heart is away for longer than that, I would also pass out or be dead.

Right when I heard that conversation, I felt my hands and feet start getting freezing cold and the whole body system breaking down, and I woke up. (Apparently the other me in that world either blacked out or dead, just as my mom predicted, but if she didn't say that out loud, I might be fine)

There is also a clever pun in the conversation too: When the nurse said I don't have any organs, I said "I put them back in the chest", the nurse said "but they are not in your chest", I said "not the chest in my body, I mean the chest is like a box, in my closet"

This actually might make a not bad horror/mystery/fantasy story, and name could just be "The Chest".
