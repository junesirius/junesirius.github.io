在准备一场葬礼，我趴在爷爷的棺材上痛哭。然后我们被告知好像有什么东西还没准备好，有些券要到下周才能用，所以他们把葬礼延期到下周日了。所以我没事干了，就去了一个商场（像在洛杉矶时候离宿舍不远的那个mall），远远地看见一些很久没见的亲戚（叔伯堂兄弟之类的）在跟妈聊天，其中一个（感觉像小伯伯）还朝我挥手打招呼了，我假装没看见，一直在离他们很远的地方，因为我还是实在非常难过，完全不想说话。

在准备葬礼的时候胡桃也在（果然往生堂堂主是不会缺席这种事的）。

（英文版本：）

I was preparing for a funeral. I was crying over a coffin. We were informed something is not ready and some coupon can't be used until next week, so they (those grownups) postponed the funeral to next Sunday. So I had nothing to do and went to shopping, saw many long time unseen relatives (uncles/aunts/cousins/...) chatting with my mom, one of the uncles waved at me and probably said hi, I pretend didn't see and stayed away from all of them, because I was too painfully sad to speak. This coffin I dreamed about is my grandpa's.
