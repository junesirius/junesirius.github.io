外星人来地球了，给每个人一个带密码的东西，只有找到密码的人才能活下去。每个人的密码都是不一样的，提示是都跟我们过去经历有关，所以我们要在我们的memory lane上走下去（可以time travel的），找到正确的时间地点，找到藏的密码，才行。我们总共有五格时间，等到只剩下两格的时候会有僵尸来追杀我们，僵尸外形跟我们正常人完全一样，但是就是没有灵魂，没有独立思考能力，唯一的目的就是追杀我们。

然后倒计时开始了，我马上跑到离当时的我最近的爷爷家，家里没人，我自己开门进去开始翻找密码。然后我听见开门声，我躲到墙后面，因为还不能确定他现在是人还是已经变成僵尸了。然后他注意到门被开了，就朝屋里喊了一声“谁在那”，然后我就知道他是真的人了，就出来跟他见面。开始聊天，他给了我一盒果汁，我问了很多我不了解的以前从来没机会问的过去的事情（因为我觉得密码是为了让我们到memory lane里去寻找过去的我们不了解的秘密和一些真相，跟我们自己和解，只有和解的人才能活下去）。我们在卫生间镜子面前，镜子里的他还是很年轻的样子，镜子里的我是一个男的。我正在问他有没有注意到镜子的异常，时间只剩两格了，僵尸闯进来了，他到外面去挡，我躲在卫生间里，手里拿了一块顺手抓的木板，然后有个僵尸出现在卫生间门口，看起来就像个正常人雇佣兵，朝我开枪，我拿木板挡了，但是被打穿了，正中心脏，我就死了。

然后我在一开始的地方复活，面前就是外星人的飞船，所有人一起在听规则。我就知道了这就像个游戏，有重生机制，被僵尸杀死以后会restart/复活，但是记忆保留，所以我就能在这一轮里得到比之前更多的信息，更有可能更快地找到答案。真正的死亡是时间用完但又没被僵尸杀死，就会变成僵尸，这才是真的死了。

然后我又跑到爷爷家，很快地继续聊，比之前进展更快，然后又到了只剩两格，我躲在没开灯的卧室门旁边，手里拿了把带锯齿的面包刀，爷爷在门的另一侧。一个看起来真的非常普通的男孩子（个子不高，头发很短，黑发）拿着武士刀在卧室门口朝里面张望，我已经看见他了但他没看见我，伸手要去开灯，然后我就知道了他们在黑暗里看不见，我在他开灯之前砍了他一下，他就倒下了。然后又过来第二个，果然是不会独立思考的因为他看见前一个倒下的身体但是完全没反应，还是像前一个一样张望但是看不见，要开灯然后开灯之前被我砸了一下头倒下了。我印象里还有我用面包刀割一个的喉咙的画面，但是很钝，割不开，只冒了一点血珠。而且因为他们看起来完全就是正常人，就让我会有在杀人的感觉，就觉得很恶心。

然后进来第三个个子很高很瘦黑发的男孩子僵尸，动作很快地开了灯，手里有枪，完全没犹豫地朝我开枪。我用刀就像乒乓拍一样接住反弹回去了四发，都反着打回去了，他也都躲开了，然后有两发实在太快了我没接住，打伤了我的大腿，我瘫坐在地上，能感觉大腿在流血。他就那样高高在上的样子朝我一步一步走近，枪指着我。我余光看见爷爷在后面用刀抹了又一个新来的脖子，但是也是非常occupied应该没空来救我，然后我就醒了。

（可能又死了，restart到下一轮去了

（印象深刻的是第二轮我听见僵尸又来了的时候说了一句非常贱贱风格的玩笑（肯定是因为昨天看的《红色通缉令》的关系）：“Looks like everyone knows we have the best juice in the building”

（镜子那里印象也很深，不知道到底是因为镜子有问题，还是我们真实形象其实就是那样但是我们自己没意识到。

（还有慢慢学习世界规则这一点我也很喜欢，就是探索开放世界，就是慢慢会知道那些东西比如被杀死可以重生，密码可能是过去的秘密，僵尸can't see in the dark，真正死了的人是变成僵尸了。

Aliens came to earth, each human got a password protected thing, only those who could find the password get to live. Everyone's password was different, and the only hint was that the password was hidden in the important place in our life in the memory lane (could be hidden in the past, so we would have to time travel to there to look for it). And we had limited five units of time, when there were only two units left, "ghosts" would come hunting us. "Ghosts" look just like normal human but they couldn't have independent thinking, couldn't see in the dark, and the only thing they could do is to kill living humans. People who were killed by ghosts could reborn to the start and do again (kind of like when fail a game and restart), but people who ran out of time but still couldn't find the password would become ghosts, which basically mean the soul is gone and it's dead for real.

So when the timer started, I ran to the closest place I could think of that was important to me -- my granddad's house. He wasn't in the house, I let myself in and started searching. Then he came back, I hid behind wall first because I couldn't be sure if he was human or a ghost that was hunting after me. Luckily he was human, we talked, I tried to ask about something in the past that I didn't know about, he gave me juice to drink. Then there was only two units of time left, ghosts came. They were just like mercenary, had weapons like guns and knives. I didn't have much escape or fight experience in the first round and got killed quite quickly.

And then I restarted at the beginning place, that's how I know we have "reborn" mechanism. I ran to granddad's house immediately, we chatted again, but I already got more information so the conversation went faster this time. Then ghosts came again, I joked: "Looks like everyone knows we have the best juice in the building." I hid in a dark room, they came in and couldn't see me, that's how I found out they couldn't see in the dark. I knocked out two of them before they turned on the light. The third one was a tall, skinny dark-hair boy (the first two were also just like teenage boys, that's why I couldn't kill them, but granddad sliced the first one's neck from behind him), held a gun and started shooting me. I had a katana in hand (grabbed from first ghost), used it to catch and throw back the first four bullets (like using a table tennis racket), changed route of the last two but they still hit my thigh. I could feel it was bleeding, the ghost walked near me, stood tall in front me, gun pointing at me, that's when the alarm clock woke me up.
