我在一座很高很陡的雪山上，要在没有滑雪设备的情况下沿着雪山滑下去。雪非常非常厚，我为了控制速度所以一直是用手摸着雪往下滑的。在一个地方前面有一个急转弯，我知道这下完全控制不住惯性肯定要被甩出去了，就努力想要让自己停下来，结果就是变成了悬在悬崖边上。我能看见下面的滑雪轨道在几米外，中间是断开的，我要跳过去才能跳到那个轨道上，如果没跳到的话就会从悬崖掉下去，不知道下面有多深。然后我就跳了。堪堪正好够到那个轨道的边缘没掉下去。

（英文版本：）

I was on a snow mountain, high, steep, full of snow, and I need to slide down the hill without any snow-ski gears. I had to use my hand to touch the snow while sliding down to control the speed. At one point, there was a sharp turn and I knew I would be threw out of the track due to inertia, so I stopped and kind of like hang on the edge.

I could see the track below me about several meters away, I had to jump to catch the edge of the track, if I missed, I'll fall into the god-knows-how-deep cliff.

And I jumped.

I very barely caught the edge and didn't fall.
