和那个阿根廷男孩子以及三个Skam里的男孩子（Isak、Jonas和他们小团体的另一个人）一起在骑车。

最初的时候路很宽，有起伏但是基本上算是比较平坦的。到了一个我认知中是酒店但看上去更像宾馆大厅的地方，厅很大很空旷，顶很高，没什么人，每张餐桌都很低，像茶几。我们围坐在大厅比较中央的一张餐桌旁边，我坐在面朝门和落地窗的一条桌子短边，我的右手边长边第一个是那个阿根廷男孩子，我的对面短边是Jonas，他的左手边长边第一个是Isak（也就是坐在那个阿根廷男孩子右手边），Jonas的右手边是另一个男生。

然后那个阿根廷男孩子说他要出去一下，我们先吃。吃的是印度菜，我用右手拿着馕，左手把白色的酱倒到上面，然后像纸折口袋一样把酱包在里面折起来吃。等我们都差不多吃完了他都还没回来，我拿手机想发“you ok?”还没发就透过落地窗看见他从门口右边一个公交站过来，进来以后说他去买公交的regular pass了，省得每次坐公交都要单独买票（有点像我在纽约买地铁周票）。

然后他们另外三个人先走，我们两个继续骑车。这次骑的路都是像《Call me by your name》里那种乡间小路，很窄很崎岖，左边是一条单行的汽车道，头顶树荫很浓。

我们骑得很快，我很容易在转弯或者高低不平的地方变得非常紧张，然后一紧张整辆车就会非常剧烈地左右摇晃，我总是感觉随时都会掉下去。我就不停地默念“Calm”才能让自己稍微放松下来，然后才能控制住把手。这样重复了三次。

（英文版本：）

There were five people initially, me, Argentina friend and three other boys from series "Skam" (Norwich version). Five of us were riding bicycles on a road that had a lot of upwards and downwards slopes, but in general not too difficult to ride. The three of them tended to ride very fast, and that Argentine was in front of me. The tail of his bike had a sign saying "Evidence that there is always a path."

After a while all of us stopped at a restaurant that looked like lobby of a hotel, very bright and large and empty, not many customer. The tables were low, more like tea tables than diner tables. We ordered some food. Before food come, the Argentine went out saying he needs to do something. Before he came back, we were already eating. I could remember eating an Indian naan by hand, I put white sauce on it and wrapped it.

But he still didn't come back when we almost finished. I started to get a little worried and texted him "you ok?" Just when message was sent, I saw him (across large French window) walking towards the restaurant. He said he went to buy a bus pass so he wouldn't need to pay every time.

After the meal, three of them parted from the two of us, we kept riding bicycles together, he was riding beside me this time. I picked a random small unfamiliar path, which was so much more fun than earlier, felt like exploring the new map together (just like in "Call me by your name"). And because the path was unfamiliar, sometimes I got anxious about the speed (we rode very fast) or lost control or went the wrong way, my bike shook and vibrated violently, the handlebar shook left and right frantically, it was really terrifying. I had to take deep breath and repeatedly tell myself to calm down. Only when I was calm again, the bike would return to calm and smooth too.
