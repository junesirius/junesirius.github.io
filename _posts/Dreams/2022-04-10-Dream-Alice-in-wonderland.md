有人让我穿了一条蓝裙子，在眼睛和脸周围化了很夸张的蓝色的妆，让我看起来就好像爱丽丝梦游仙境里的什么角色。然后有另一个女人穿了差不多风格也是很夸张的裙子和妆，不过都是红色的。所以我们是“红皇后”和“蓝皇后”。

这些人也想让我们去一个什么舞台和红毯上去展示，好像我们是模特之类 。但是我好讨厌聚光灯，就很慌。

然后还有三条大得像熊一样的黑狗蹲在我宿舍外面（是大学宿舍的样子），我从外面回来第一次看见它们的时候也是被吓到了，就往外面跑。外面是一个很空旷的场地，两边隔很远有面向中间的楼，也有来往在走的学生，但是人不太多。我跑的时候狗就在后面追，它们跑得比我快，我特别害怕，但是它们追上我以后停下来开始说话，说它们其实是我的守卫。

再后面有个碎片是我在坐公交去一个地方（认知中好像是回家），然后在一个立交桥底下的红绿灯地方我看着导航应该是往前的，结果红绿灯亮了之后车变成往右开了，我知道家的方向应该是在左边，就有点慌了不知道为什么公交改路线了。

（英文版本：）

Someone forced me to wear blue dress and have exaggerate blue makeup all over my eyes and face that made me look like some character from Alice in Wonderland. There was another woman wearing similar ridiculous dress and makeup but was red everywhere, so we were blue queen and red queen.

Those people also wanted me to walk on some kind of stage and red carpet to show, just like a model or something. I hated spotlight so much, it terrified me.

There were three large black dogs, as big as a bear, waiting around my room, also terrified me when I came back from outside and saw them for the first time. I tried to ran away but they followed me and ran faster than me. I was so terrified but they were not hurting me, they started to talk, saying they're my guards.
