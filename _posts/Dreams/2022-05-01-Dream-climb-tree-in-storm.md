我们被要求学会怎么样在暴风雨天气爬一棵很大的树。要求用来爬的树特别直特别高，靠近地面的下层几乎完全没有可以受力的枝杈，很高的地方为数不多的一些枝杈也看起来实在太细了不可能用来承重。我很不想爬，但是看所有人好像都逃不掉地要学，所以就也像他们/她们一样开始准备一些文件材料。

那些文件材料包括申请表和一些免责书，要求附上护照复印件和很多看上去就像高中作业卷的A3大小的纸。我很忙地准备那些材料，但是还是准备得太慢了，其他人都已经交上出去了。我一个人被留在后面，孤零零地留在暴风雨里，想要搞明白我手里这些文件要交给谁，还有剩下的人都到哪里去了。

（英文版本：）

We needed to learn how to climb a large tree in a terrible thunder storm weather, and the target tree was very straight, almost no branches in the lower part. The only branches were also too tiny to be stepped on, so it was very difficult and dangerous and terrifying to climb. I didn't want to climb but felt like everyone had to, and also had to hand in a lot of paperwork as application and responsibility disclaimer.

I was busy preparing those paperwork (including copies of passport and a lot of exam papers from high school and other stuffs), but I was too slow and late, everyone else had already handed in and went out.

I was left behind, alone in the storm weather, trying to find out who to deliver these files and where the rest of people were.
