有人想淹死我，往我房间里灌洪水。到处都是水，我知道我爸妈也在这里。还好我有潜水服，穿上以后还能正常呼吸。但是水实在太多了，不知道为什么这个潜水服没法浮到水面，我感觉我在不停地沉下去，非常焦虑氧气可能会用完。

然后我和爸妈从洪水里出来了，到一个看上去同时是一个救援处和演出的场馆。入口的一个女人问我们要护照和身份证号码。我发现我护照上的号码是错的，但是我又背不出对的号码。很努力地想了好久，背出来也还是查了几位，所以她就不能让我们进去。我们本来已经是迟到看演出了，现在变成完全错过了。

（英文版本：）

Someone wanted to drown me, there were flood filling the room I stayed, water was everywhere, my family was also there. Luckily I had my diving suit with me, so I could still breath, but there was too much water, the suit somehow couldn't float to the surface, I felt I was continuously sinking down and got really worried about running out of oxygen.

When I finally escaped from the water, me and my family went to a place looks like a rescue center and a show center. The lady at the entry asked for our passport and citizen ID. I found out the ID on my passport was wrong and I couldn't remember the right one. I tried really hard but still missed several digits. So she couldn't let us in, we were initially late for the show, now we completely missed it.
