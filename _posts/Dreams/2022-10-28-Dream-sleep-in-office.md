我睡在公司的豆袋沙发上过夜，身上盖了一张毯子。我醒的时候时间还早，办公室里还没什么人。我困惑了一秒为什么临时决定的睡办公室还会带了毯子，然后意识到这不是临时决定的，我还带了整套的旅行包，用来刷牙洗脸梳头发什么的。（可能因为以前想过睡在办公室或者UCLA实验室）

已经在办公室了的几个人里有R（在他平时的座位上），J和A经过走廊的时候看见我正要去卫生间刷牙。有一个新来的男生背着一个很大的吉他包，K说他来访问了几天现在要走了。我跟他握手，说“Nice to have you here”，但是其实完全不知道他是谁（梦里的我也不知道他是谁），一边握一边心理在想“Who the heck are you”。

然后K带了一个警官到我们厨房旁边的餐桌旁，说有人偷了我们的产品。桌上放了一个圆柱形的塑料盒子，里面本来应该有两支对称摆放的智能口红的，现在只有一支了，另一支被偷走了。警官说他会调查的。

那张桌上还有好多别的东西，上面写了名字的花，看上去像是礼物一样包扎装饰好的盒子，看上去像蛋糕盒子的盒子，一根写了“xxx生日快乐”的丝带（这个xxx是一个高中同学）。然后K说“为什么她的生日明明还没到，我们就以前提前等着准备庆祝了。”我很嫉妒她的好人缘，明明她的生日是比我晚的，所有人只是等着庆祝她的生日。我摸了一下桌子，上面黏糊糊的，感觉好像有人洒了什么甜饮料又没擦干净，感觉很恶心，就更不高兴了。

有一个地方我听见我的Alexa闹钟响了，我想用语音控制叫她关掉，但是我喉咙特别干，张嘴想说话的时候发不出声音，我就走回我的工位去喝水，想再试一次。

然后我真的醒了（闹钟真的在响），然后我还很困惑为什么我还在家里而不是在办公室。

（所以这次这个多元宇宙版本的公司是做智能口红产品开发的了。

（英文版本：）

I slept over the office on beanbag with only a thin blanket. When I woke up it was still early and not much people in office. I was confused for a second how I had that blanket with me if I randomly decided to sleep over but then realized it was not a random decision, I even prepared the whole travel kit for brushing teeth, combing hair and everything.

There were several people in office, R sit in the same place, J and A saw me brushing teeth when they were walking past the corridor. There was a new boy with a large guitar bag, K said he visited for a few days and was about to leave. I shook his hands and said "Nice to have you here" while having no idea who he is (not even when I was in the dream, like, when I was shaking hands I literally was thinking "Who the heck are you")

Then K led a police officer to our side counter near the kitchen, said someone stole our product. He pointed at a plastic cylinder thingy with two red lipsticks inside, he said we should have two display products placed in symmetry, and now the other one was lost, and pointed at an empty place on the desk. The police said he would look into it.

There were more stuffs on that desk near the kitchen, some flowers with names on it, some gift-like wrapped boxes, some boxes that looked like cake, a colorful ribbon said "Happy Birthday to xxx" (this someone was my high school friend). And K said "Why is her birthday not coming yet but we're already all waiting to celebrate." And I felt jealous because of how popular she was, her birthday was after mine but everyone was just waiting for her birthday. I touched the desk and its surface was sticky, like someone had spilled some sweet drink on it and didn't fully clean up, which felt disgusting, made me more unhappy.

There was also one point when I heard my voice-control alarm clock ringing, I tried to ask it to shut down but my throat was too dry to speak, like I tried to talk but no sound came out. So I went back to my seat to drink water before trying again.

And then I actually woke up, felt confused again why I was still at home instead of already in the office. The dream felt real.
