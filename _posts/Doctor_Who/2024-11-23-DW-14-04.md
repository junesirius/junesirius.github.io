DW1404，好喜欢好喜欢。这感觉太对味了，一点点惊悚一点点悬疑，很多很多的遗憾离别困惑孤独，一眼看出是RTD的剧本然后查了果然没猜错。

设定在威尔士和Cardiff，博士老家，是彩蛋也是必然。Cardiff is always the center of magic.

博士出场加起来没五分钟，剩下全是Ruby的“take the long way”。Something is wrong but she's taking the long way home. 就像壁炉女孩，就像Amy的normal life after angel in Manhattan。The life without Doctor is no life at all. 但是Ruby就这样过了65年，one day at a time, alone，难过又感动。拉时间线这种操作，“40 years later”，一不小心就过完了一生，一不小心就可能是永远的错过，就像壁炉女孩那里，一不小心took two seconds too long and it's already too late。有time machine也没法弥补的too late，非常容易抓住我的心。

倒是从一开始就猜出mysterious woman是年老的她自己了，时间线梗的经典套路，but no less powerful。只是不知道这消失的另一条时间线，Ruby有没有至少在潜意识里记住些什么，感觉就像spn的what if线，像Sam在土拨鼠日星期二之后的那个星期三和之后的四个月不得不经历的那些，像2014endverse，突然意识到了what if和alternate universe的差别：You are still you, not a different you from different universe, and you remember。

Kate和UNIT出场的桥段，很惊喜很喜欢。特别被戳到的地方是Kate说他们有这样的tradition，help Doctor's former companion when they come back to normal life。感到很心疼，为每一个Doctor's former companion感到心疼，this is a man (or woman) flying everywhere in a blue box, you travel with him (or her) for some time and you will think you can be there with him all the time, but in the end, he always flys away by himself, leaving you behind. That's what happened to all his former companions, they were left behind. You have been to the universe, traveling, seeing all these opportunities and choices and adventures, and then one day, you're back on Earth, back to normal earthly boring daily life. How can you do that? How can you live like that ever again? 就像之前把Sarah Jane重新邀请回来，看到她和博士的重逢，it's been forty years, Doctor changed face, Sarah Jane lived normal life for 40 years. That's the problem with humans, we get old so quickly, our lives are too short, then why does the Doctor keeps looking for humans as companions? Knowing they will always leave, die or just get left behind, at the end?

所以听到Kate说到他们的这个tradition，非常感动，感觉几乎像是一种veteran program了，specializing in handling post-Doctor syndrome，而现在Ruby刚成为companion三天就已经有这种依赖和loss了，Doctor's charm and curse。

知道Doctor不在的这条时间线里UNIT也在保护世界，也有点感动。Not all burden is on Doctor, someone got his back too. 很喜欢这种互相拯救的剧情，Doctor保护人类，但人类不是单纯的被保护者，we fight together, we get his back too, we're comrades and friends, we're equal.
