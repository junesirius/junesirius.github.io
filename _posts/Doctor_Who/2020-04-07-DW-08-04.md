没有怪物，没有外星人，没有run，只有自己的恐惧，但……it's ok to fear.

看见了还是哭泣的小男孩的博士，有些不习惯但很真实，毕竟这个已经上千岁的博士，也是从七八岁过来的。一个人蒙在被子里哭，不想参军不喜欢暴力这一点倒是上千年都没变过的了。喜欢探索这样的博士，害怕黑暗但善于隐藏，更喜欢看见有这样一个Clara看见了他的害怕，跟他说it's ok.

<br>

为什么“害怕”是好的。

> Let me tell you about "scared". Your heart is beating so hard. There is so much blood and oxygen pumping through your brain. It's like rocket fuel. Right now, you could run faster, you could fight harder, you could jump higher than ever in your life. And you are so alert it's like you can slow down time.
> 
> What's wrong with scared? Scared is a superpower. It's your superpower.

<br>

重回谷仓的战争博士，呼应五十周年特辑：

> If yoy are very clever and very strong, fear doesn't have to make you cruel or cowardly. Fear can make you kind. 

喜欢这句“恐惧会让你很温柔”

<br>

> You are always going to be afraid, even if you know how to hide it. Fear is like a companion, a constant companion, always there. But that's ok, because fear can bring us together. Fear can bring you home. Fear makes companions of us all.

所以，Clara微微修改了博士的整个时间线，从小时候开始。害怕黑暗的博士，现在再想起床底或是黑暗中的恐惧时，会想起Clara的这些话了。
