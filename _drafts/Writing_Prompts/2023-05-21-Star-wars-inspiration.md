### 1.【obikin】《What Have You Done》Lyrics

(by Within Temptation)

Would you mind if I hurt you?

Understand that I need to

Wish that I had other choices

Than to harm the one I love



What have you done now?



I know I'd better stop trying

You know that there's no denying

I won't show mercy on you now



I know I should stop believing

I know there's no retrieving

It's over now, what have you done?



What have you done now?



I, I've been waiting for someone like you

But now you are slipping away

What have you done now?

Why, why does fate make us suffer?

There's a curse between us, between me and you



What have you done?

What have you done now?



Would you mind if I killed you?

Would you mind if I tried to?

'Cause you have



Turned into my worst enemy

You carry hate that I don't feel

It's over now, what have you done?



What have you done now?



I, I've been waiting for someone like you

But now you are slipping away

What have you done now?

Why, why does fate make us suffer?

There's a curse between us, between me and you



What have you done?



I will not fall, won't let it go

We will be free when it ends

### 2.【obikin】冬天怕冷的小安

（梗源生活，在夏天被冷到了然后想到的）

小安是沙漠星球出生的，容易怕冷不怕热（虽然也有昼夜温差）

脑了一个在科洛桑的冬天冷到了然后被师父用厚被子裹起来的小孩

（当然也有可能被师父拎出去冰天雪地让他练习用原力御寒，小孩冷到牙齿打颤，欧比旺非常努力地在心里跟自己说要严厉一点才可能教得好，但是硬忍了一会儿终于还是没忍住，把小孩抱回来了

### 3. 【obikin】童话镇S3设定

套用童话镇S3彼得潘梦幻岛上的一个设定，只有说出一个足够重要的秘密才能救中间被困的人，安纳金被困，欧比旺只有说出爱才能救他

（这个设定对所有不敢承认真心的cp真是太好用了）
