### 1.【obikin】《What Have You Done》Lyrics

(by Within Temptation)

Would you mind if I hurt you?

Understand that I need to

Wish that I had other choices

Than to harm the one I love



What have you done now?



I know I'd better stop trying

You know that there's no denying

I won't show mercy on you now



I know I should stop believing

I know there's no retrieving

It's over now, what have you done?



What have you done now?



I, I've been waiting for someone like you

But now you are slipping away

What have you done now?

Why, why does fate make us suffer?

There's a curse between us, between me and you



What have you done?

What have you done now?



Would you mind if I killed you?

Would you mind if I tried to?

'Cause you have



Turned into my worst enemy

You carry hate that I don't feel

It's over now, what have you done?



What have you done now?



I, I've been waiting for someone like you

But now you are slipping away

What have you done now?

Why, why does fate make us suffer?

There's a curse between us, between me and you



What have you done?



I will not fall, won't let it go

We will be free when it ends

### 2.【obikin】冬天怕冷的小安

（梗源生活，在夏天被冷到了然后想到的）

小安是沙漠星球出生的，容易怕冷不怕热（虽然也有昼夜温差）

脑了一个在科洛桑的冬天冷到了然后被师父用厚被子裹起来的小孩

（当然也有可能被师父拎出去冰天雪地让他练习用原力御寒，小孩冷到牙齿打颤，欧比旺非常努力地在心里跟自己说要严厉一点才可能教得好，但是硬忍了一会儿终于还是没忍住，把小孩抱回来了

### 3.【obikin】童话镇S3设定

套用童话镇S3彼得潘梦幻岛上的一个设定，只有说出一个足够重要的秘密才能救中间被困的人，安纳金被困，欧比旺只有说出爱才能救他

（这个设定对所有不敢承认真心的cp真是太好用了）

### 4.【obikin】半机器人王

人类安纳金 x 半机器人欧比旺

（从TCW S01E16看见穿克隆军盔甲的俩人想到的）

### 5.【obikin】燃烧的视野

（看欧比旺剧S01E03想到的）

穆斯塔法之后安妮的视野也一直是流动的火，看到的整个世界也总是燃烧的，所以他杀人时候完全没有感觉没有波澜，在他的世界里就只是好像把这些人推到他已经在了的岩浆里。他其实一直没有从那里爬出来。但是欧比旺在他的视野是有颜色有阴影的，是实实在在的

但是在安妮一剑（不小心）杀了老王以后连这唯一看起来真实的人也消失了

但是视野里燃烧的火也突然安静下来了，红色褪去，他终于从穆斯塔法爬出来了。

但是这一次没有出来的人是欧比旺

欧比旺死了以后就好像抛弃了安妮一次，留他一个人在这个世界上带着连他自己都厌恶的身体和灵魂活下去

所以老王死了以后安妮其实也不是太想活了

（安妮的自我厌恶这个点好喜欢

### 6.【obikin】幻觉梗

（欧比旺S01E03）

### 7.【obikin】警探AU精分梗

维达的人格和安妮的人格之间切换

凶手是维达，安妮跟老王是警探

（已经脑了穿警服的安妮和老王

（血淋淋的维达（不是自己的血）啊也好喜欢

安妮老王跟着线索转悠转悠，安妮：这地方我怎么有点眼熟

### 8.【obikin】穆斯塔法的另一种后续

老王在穆斯塔法以后，在皇帝来之前，把安妮捞走了

终究还是没舍得leave him to die，带到自己地方给他治烧伤

安妮好长一段时间昏迷不醒，老王一度觉得他真要死了但是安妮一直生命迹象起起伏伏地居然也活下来了

然后终于等到能醒来了以后发现还在老王地方就发疯生气挣扎，但是都没用，没有自理能力没给他配备那些高级设备所以他基本上完全任人摆布

但是老王也就保持距离地跟他接触，基本情感上也表现得很疏离

偶尔想跟他说说话了安妮就有一句没一句地应，也会有时候完全不想回答就只有绝对的沉默作为一种反抗

（脑完才看到《穆斯塔法没有星星》，设定有点重合）

### 9.【走天父子】维达带娃

维达带娃AU下卢克上小学，然后大家都知道他爸是维达，都很害怕不敢跟他玩，然后卢克小学第一天回家很难过不想再去了

### 10.【obikin】Captainswan代餐

欧比旺不敢爱因为爱的人都失去了

安纳金：I'm a survivor

### 11.【走天兄妹】卢克莱娅

（吃沙剧有感）

就算安妮没陪儿子女儿一起长大，如果卢克和莱娅是一起长大的，会怎么样

卢克肯定会是个妹宠

有哥哥顶着，莱娅可能会更皮x

### 12. HP AU

On his 11th birthday, they had an unexpected guest. "Anakin Skywalker, you are a wizard." the stranger told him.

### 13. 霍比特人AU

In a quiet corner of the galaxy, in the remote planet of Tatooine, there lived a young man named Anakin Skywalker. He was an unassuming individual, content with his simple life in the desert town of Mos Espa. Anakin had never ventured far from the sandy dunes and twin sunsets that colored his days. Little did he know that his life was about to take an unexpected turn, and he would embark on a journey that would test his courage and change the course of history.

One fine evening, as Anakin sat outside his humble abode, gazing up at the endless expanse of stars, a shadowy figure approached him. It was a mysterious old wizard known as Obi-Wan Kenobi, clad in tattered robes and carrying a staff that glowed with an otherworldly light.

"Anakin Skywalker," the wizard spoke, his voice filled with a hint of urgency, "I bring tidings of great importance. Your presence is requested in the distant realm of the Jedi Council."

Anakin's eyes widened with astonishment. He had heard tales of the Jedi Knights, revered warriors who harnessed the power of the Force to maintain peace and justice. Never did he imagine that he would be summoned by such legendary figures.

"But I am but a simple farmer, Master Kenobi," Anakin replied, his voice tinged with uncertainty. "What purpose could the Jedi Council have for someone like me?"

Obi-Wan Kenobi smiled, his eyes twinkling with a mixture of wisdom and mischief. "Ah, my dear Skywalker, there is more to you than meets the eye. The Force flows strong within you, and a great destiny awaits you. You possess the power to bring balance to the galaxy."

Anakin's heart swelled with a mix of fear and excitement. He had always yearned for something more, a life beyond the confines of Tatooine. This was his chance to embark on an adventure, to discover his true potential.

"Will you join me on this perilous journey, Anakin Skywalker?" Obi-Wan Kenobi asked, extending his weathered hand.

Anakin hesitated for a moment, the weight of his decision pressing upon him. But deep down, he knew that his path lay beyond the boundaries of his desert home. With a determined resolve, he grasped the wizard's hand, sealing his fate.

"I will accompany you, Master Kenobi," Anakin declared, his voice filled with newfound determination. "Together, we shall face whatever trials await us and bring hope to a galaxy in need."

And so, under the shimmering starry sky, Anakin Skywalker bid farewell to his familiar world, embarking on an extraordinary journey that would test his courage, forge unbreakable bonds, and reveal the hero within. As he stepped into the unknown, he had no idea of the incredible adventures, strange creatures, and epic battles that awaited him. The galaxy was vast and filled with wonders, and Anakin Skywalker, the unlikely hero from Tatooine, was about to become a legend in his own right.

### 14.【走天家】黑化卢克，走天家混乱相爱相杀

突然想看卢克为了保护妹妹黑化杀了ppt然后父子统治银河系，也是一种HE呢！

然后，莱娅带着反抗军杀过来

卢克：我是你哥哥

安妮：我是你爸爸

莱娅：……

然后莱娅去学原力（突然发现，尤达和老王这时候都走了，她还能跟谁学？跟幽灵老王吧就），学成回来对峙卢克和安妮

本来绝对没可能赢的但是因为他俩都太爱她了所以双双被莱娅杀了

死前三个人泪汪汪表真心

安妮：对不起，我本来可以给你一个家的

安妮对卢克：I failed you

蕾娅对卢克安妮：I hate you

卢克对蕾娅：I failed you

蕾娅对卢克：It's not your fault

（啊好痛，想看

### 15.【obikin】AI/机器人安妮

AI AU/西部世界AU，机器人安妮

慢慢被老王注入情感

调试多了以后，突然有天自己琢磨出了爱

老王：我没给你输入过这个呀

安妮：可是我学会了

### 16. 希腊神话AU

（来自维基：“生于塔图因的安纳金也被称作“太阳之子”（Son of the suns）”）

安纳金：阿波罗之子

可以走特洛伊AU？

### 17.【obikin】环太平洋AU

精神连接打架时候趁机颅内聊天

安妮：边打架边在想各种奇怪事情

老王：你专心点！（但是忍不住/被迫跟着看那些奇怪事情）

然后脑着脑着安妮就开始想老王了

老王被迫看着在他颅内的自己hhhh

老王：别想了，我就在这里

老王：你脑子里天天在想什么啊！！！！！

### 18.【obikin】《Heavenly Hell》Lyrics

(by Instanzia)

Here's a story of a dream gone bad

A tale of hate surrounded love

In this dream I believed a new world 

would come to me



So many nice thoughts, so futile

I felt so full of faith

In this dream I believed a new world 

would come to me



Then the whole world shifted shapes and hate made its way

Their twisted minds kept telling evil lies

Then I tried to keep believing love's stronger than hate

I hoped we'd reach our land of the free



Deep in my mind I knew that it was bound to fail

Some moments of illusion kept it alive



There's so much I regret, all the things I could have done

I have been blind all that time

But now I know I should have followed my heart

Out of this Heavenly Hell



From the first day the battle was lost 

'cause narrow minds never surrender

We shouldn't have fought this war of lies

After years of closing our eyes the war had to end

We've never reached our land of the free

### 19.【Anakin个人向】《F.T.L.》Lyrics

(by Keldian)

As the engines start to spin

Childhood dreams from deep within



My mind is so clear

Stand fast show no fear

Engage



Heavier than a star, no place is too far

Not even space and time can touch this ship of mine

Split second darkness and the blaze of a foreign sun

### 20.【走天家】维达意识到自己杀死了自己的儿女

ep4维达着急杀欧比旺那天，他的一双儿女差点都在垃圾池子里死掉，他本来很可能在同一天突然真的失去所有人的，但是他不知道。他真的可能会失去所有骨肉血亲。他的一双儿女能长那么大真是不容易……

如果那天他们真的都在他眼皮底下死掉了，然后欧比旺临死补一刀：“这是你儿子女儿”，他会不会直接崩溃的（好痛

先看卢克莱娅死在安纳金/维达面前，然后他失去了（或者在他们还有最后一口气时候）才知道这是他孩子

也可以写那时候帕德梅没死，安纳金变成维达之后知道了帕德梅没死，就知道ppt骗他，然后洗白弄死了ppt，然后卢克莱娅死在他面前了（也可能是在他洗白之前他自己亲手弄死了），帕德梅这次真的心碎而死，安纳金痛不欲生：“What have I done”

（想象开局大家看见帕德梅没死应该很高兴，到后面结果仍然全都死了，超级痛x（兴高采烈

### 21.【obikin】captainswan《Ensename》代餐

喝醉的心烦意乱的安纳金摘了假手抱怨这让他残肢末端发疼，欧比旺这才开始意识到他在Geonosis之后就没见过他在他面前摘下过机械假手，残肢让他心疼，安纳金也很少露出这样脆弱的一面
