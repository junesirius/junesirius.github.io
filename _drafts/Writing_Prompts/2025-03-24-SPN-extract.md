# Some things I still can't tell you

(published 2021)

## Love poems

### 1. The Kiss

The longest kisses

Were some of the first.

In high school, we sat on the east lawn hill

By the student center.

There's a picture, me lying on my back,

You straddling me, marking property

On that lawn, in your blazer,

With our friends sunning nearby.



I remember lying face-to-face

Breathing your breaths,

Mouths open, lips jioned,

Breathing out as you breathed in.

Our stomachs pressed,

Mine rising as yours receded,

Inhaling to exhaling

Used air.



Did we deprive ourselves of oxygen?

Did we kill brain cells?

Would we have scored higher on the SATs

If we hadn't been so in love?



This morning, decades later, in our ultra-chic kitchen

You disappeared into the living room, saying:

"I'm going to leave you work out your own bad mood.

I'm not going to wait around for you to take it out on me."

When I couldn't see you anymore,

I called out,



"Don't leave me like that. Be nice before you go."

And you came straight back and leaned down

And kissed me with still, pursed lips,

And we held our mouths together for the longest time

Before peeling back to start our days.

### 2.【cockles】Leg Wrestlers

I remember getting to know you

As a body in my bed.

I don't mean that way,

Or at least not just that way;

I mean learning to sleep

Next to someone else.

We used to spool the duvet

Around ourselves,

Leaving the other uncovered,

And you'd drool

On my shoulder,

On the pillows,

On anything you could

Get your sleeping lips on.

But the main thing I remember

From sleeping in the

Getting-to-know-you years

Was our war for

Vertical dominance,

Who'd flop their leg on top

And who'd be the Pinned-down underdog.

In later years, we'd be content

Under or over,

As long as some

Leg-flopping was going on.

I remembered this last night in bed

When me knee crept up the hotel wall,

Looking for you as I tried to sleep.

### 3. A Meal of Beets

Last night, we ate beets

Raw and warm, with rice and greens,

An avocado, and a broken head of garlic

In a wooden bowl between us,

Our faces lit by a dropping, half-melted candle.



You said eating like this reminded you of

Our summer in Washington:

All the vegetables, slow and nowhere to go.



Then from your office you brought a note

On one of those torn half-sheets

That you write to me on planes from time to time.

You dropped the folded page beside my plate,

Pinked with beet and a few grains of scattered rice.



I leaned in toward the candle across our table,

To your adoring eyes, and read these words,

Written while you were crying at a window seat.



Now -- after seventeen yearrs,

Four cities, shared partners, pregnancy scares,

And so many things that add up to two lives already lived,



Reading your note, at our table, in my voice,

I heard you were ready to accept my love,

Which, of course, changes everything.

### 4.【cockles】The Mother of Learning

"Paftarenya mat oocheniya"

Is Russian for:

"Repetition is the mother of learning."

There are parts of your body

That I replay in my mind

Like a scratch on a vinyl record,

The needle of my memory

Returning again and again

To the same part of you,

Repeating and repeating

Until your contours are

What I know best,

What I love most.

### 5.【cockles】Sun and Shadow

Last night, Saint Patrick's Day out on a rainy street,

I got a call from you.

We complimented each other for having

Told the truth,

For having that to count on

All these years.



And then you explained how you'd discovered

That San Francisco streets always have a sunny side

And a shady side,

That back in LA the buildings were so spread

That both sides are sunny,

And in New York, the buildings are so tall

That it's shade, shade, shade, except at high noon.

You said you hoped you would get a chance

To show me the one-side-sunny-other-side-shady thing;

You hoped I would come back with you and see the light,

And I told you you melted me.



Then in front of me, a woman with a shamrock hat yelled,

"Stop, you fucker!" to a passing cab,

And I said to you, "I'm freezing," which I was,

And that I had to go inside.

"Inside where?"

"Just a cafe," I lied,

As I opened the door to a tanning salon.

There are some things I still can't tell you.

### 6. A Five Point Eight

At my desk the room sways,

And this is not a boat.

The blinds shouldn't be swinging

With the windows shut.



I run reflexively out to the yard and

Looking in our shaking window

I see her in the sundress that I bought,

Standing in an inside doorway

In our first rocking California quake.



The lawn moves under me.

She's still frozen in the door;

I just have time to think,

"Please, God, let me have

Built this home strong enough."



When the ground steadies under me,

I find her barefoot in the kitchen.

She says she remembered "doorway";

I tell her that now they say

To get outside but that I'm glad

I got to see her hips and

Shapely silhouette from behind.

### 7.【cockles/destiel】Devil in the Details

When I'm far from you,

I imagine the

Details of your existence,

What you had for breakfast,

Who you saw for lunch,

Whether you have on

Your white sweater

Or your red one

On this East Coast winter day,

As if painting in

Your waking hours

With textures, tastes,

And geographies

Will make you

More real to me

And close the space between us.

### 8. Lake of Life

Last night, in the bed in the dark

There were spells of quiet,

Long stretches when she'd say nothing,

And I knew that she was crying.



Her father died a year and a half ago.

Waves of mourning still come,

Along with some regret.



She said, "But I feel like I know him

Better now that he's gone."



When I fell asleep,

I dreamt the following poem:



When you were swimming in the lake of life,

You thrashed and kicked up your head,

Your arms slapped the surface waves and water foam.

But there's a calm and glassy stillness

In the quiet of your death,

And I can see far down

To the depths of you

That I never knew to love.

### 9. June Second

This morning, we walked outside

And the street was covered in freshly fallen Jacaranda petals:

A blanket of floopy purple snow.



I complained.

"We wait all year for these flowers,

And they're gone in a week."



"Hmm," she said,

Crushing wilted purple blossoms with her shoes.

"Hmm what?"

"I haven't been waiting for anything."



But she has.

I know it.

(appeared in *Pearl*, Issue 41, 2009)

### 10. AM

Waking up,

There are always things

To be grateful for.

Obvious, easy things:



Like first sun climbing past

The petals of the bougainvillea

Through my bedroom window

And knocking

In patches

On my eyelids.



How could I not be thankful for that?



Or another thing,

Witnessing her sleeping cheeks

Stretch into her yawning,

I love you,

Good morning grin.



If you saw it, you'd know.

Anyone would feel lucky then.



Or the scratching of those little

Finch feet on the feeder.



I think when I hear that,

*That God for that.*



But this morning,

When I swung sitting sideways

On the edge of the bed

In that space before standing,

I found a big thing

I had been missing:



I have to remember to

Be grateful for me.

### 11. Couch Camping

A morning exercise:

We've been

Saying, face-to-face,

What we love,

How we feel,

Appreciating

Me for her and

Her for me.



This morning, we put a

Knit blanket over our heads,

And on the couch,

In our cotton tent,

We stare eye to eye.

"I feel like we are an electromagnet."

"I don't know what that is."

"I don't either, but you make me feel like one."

"I loved when you kissed me

When I gave you pineapple."

That makes her cry.



When we lean in to nuzzle,

Blinded in collapsing cotton folds

Of blue knit tent,

We bump foreheads

Before finding lips.

### 12.【jenmish/destiel】Clasped

I keep walking between two buildings at work today.

This February-dark day can't decide if it wants to rain

Or sleet or snow, so it's settled somewhere between

And a cold, steady, wet white lands as droplets on my sleeve.



I look up and the backlit flakes disappear

Against a wilderness of gray.

The sky is perfectly painted the color of cold.

Looking up, my open eyes are pelted from above,

And when I stop to blink and close my lids,

I suddenly see you.



Your cold and rosy rain-chapped cheeks

Reflected in the window of a city shop,

But your winter storm is in another place.

My left grabs my clenched right fist,

Yearning for your distant hands to be in mine.

### 13. Brown Hens

My wife reads to me from the guidebook

About the cheesemakers

On the island where you can see the cheese made.

We follow the map off the coast highway.



"There! Old Shelburne Road," she reads from a sign,

Her eager finger pointing.

On the farm's long gravel drive,

Her back floats just off the seat.



They have goats to pet

And windows to look through.

We can see women dressed as maids making cheese.



Tasting every sample twice,

She reads how many eggs per chicken per year.

She asks if brown hens lay brown ones.

"I don't think so," I offer.



Winding back to the coast, belly full,

She confesses:

"The book said it was for children."

### 14.Tug of Woman

Last night, I shared a woman with a bed.

We wrestled her back and forth for hours,

The bed and I.

I started with the upper hand;

My calves wrapped her shins,

My nose pressed her neck

(Inhaling scents of suckling infancy).

"You smell like a baby," I said,

And she smiled with her shoulders.



Then our furnace of body heat

Bolstered the bed's advance,

And the sheets peeled her

From my sweating chest

And gripped her

In their damp half nelson.

And so went the night,

Tug of woman

Between a bed and me.

### 15.【pretend jenmish】Zen Morning

We sat outside to meditate on our new used couch

By the turtle pond I made off our back porch.

Still in your underwear, you brough us blankets,

And we sat with the trickles of the fountain sounds,

Morning warming with the rising sun.

Bobbing between asleep and awake,

You lay your head on my lap.

Then, that screaming, clanging, weekly revving truck:

"Shit!" I said, "It's garbage day."

I ran flushed to the alley,

Furious at my forgetfulness.

### 16.【jenmish】Fall Back

It's the first cold rain of late fall,

And for the first time, I turn on

My apartment's fireplace.

The smell of summer's dust is burning off.

My landlord says he can't find

A lightbulb that fits this room's lamp.



The clouds out the small window

And the sound of rain running down the glass,

Along with the fire,

Could add up to autumn coziness,

But in this nest, there is no you,

So all I see is damp and dark today.

### **17.【jenmish/destiel】These Hours**

I want more time,

More of you.

I want more youth,

More good years

With un-sore hips

And late-night lips.

I want to travel

Back to our beginning

So I can re-learn you

And re-earn you,

This time better.

This time, I'll savor and

Remember everything.

This time, time will

Slow down in

All the right places

And fly by when

You fly away.

This time, I'll make

Einstein's relativity

Bend to my will.

This time,

These hours will be

Our hours.

### **18. Way-Finding**

When I met you, I was twenty pounds lighter,

An inch shorter,

And a child.



You were always full-grown

And perfect

In my child's mind.



And now we've lived a life together

With homes and jobs and even kids.

We loved one another,

**We loved others,**

We wondered who we were.



And now we're grown

(Perhaps not old)

And yet we still

Want to know

How to live and

How to love.



You said last night,

**"What does it mean?**

**That you love me?"**

**And I'm not really sure.**



All I know

Is that without you

I am lost.

### 19.【pretend jenmish】The Center

When I accidentally swipe right on my iPhone's home screen,

It takes me to the "control center," a serious name

For a useless function.

I never navigate there on purpose, but there it is.

Between texts and tweets from my clumsiness,

And it shows me a new photo from years ago

Featured at the top of the screen,

A picture iOS has picked for me,

With the words in white letters, "For you."

Most days, that photo is of you smiling.



Last night, my knuckles nudged the screen to the right,

And a picture popped up.

Us side by side in Bali with parrots on our shoulders.

I teared up and stupidly texted it to you.

**I wrote, "I will always feel this way about you.**

**I will never not love you."**

**Retyping that now, tears again.**



When I was learning to act

And needed to cry for a scene,

I would often imagine the unbearable emptiness

Of a life without you.

## Hope, joy, running & other good things

### 1. Reread

Yesterday I read a used book

Whose previous readers

Had inexhaustible supplies

Of red and yellow ink.



Whole chapters highlighted.

Paragraphs double underlined in

Straight, red rows.



And I imagined my young fore-reader

Hunched later at a shared table

In the Portland State library,

Hiding a cold, surreptitious coffee

Between his legs,

Reading lines likem

"Be the running, not the runner."

And uncapping his red pen

Yet again,

Thinking:

"Yes, yes, that's it!

I AM THE RUNNING!"

(appeared in *California Quarterly*, Volume 34, no. 1)

### 2.【jenmish】In Passing

I'm alone in San Francisco.

And this morning, a man walked past me

On a steep hillside sidewalk.



I was on Grant Street, my knees pointing downhill;

I turned shoulder-front and sideways

To slip past the city shoppers,

And, in a white oxford,

Under the sheath of a shaved scalp,

The man climbed toward me,

And, passing, he said the words,

"Don't be lonely. Be HAPPY."



Not looking back, he just kept walking

Up and up toward a cable car.



He was speaking to me.

I'm sure of it.

### 3.【destiel human Cas】Suddenly

A piece of grass,

Not a whole **blade**,

Just a severed piece,

Drying in the sidewalk's sun.



I walk down my jog

In a mowed afternoon,

And even here in a shard of **green**,

In a fragment of a thing

That is smaller than a leaf,

Even here,

The magic of this life.

(appeared in *Columbia Poetry Review*, no. 32, Spring 2019)

### 4.【underlying jenmish】Watershed

I've been wanting to explore my city,

Be a tourist at home

Because lately I've been curious about everything,

Even cracks in the side walk.



So today, a Saturday, I'm on a bus

Touring the LA River

With twenty-five curious others

Aiming digital cameras at this greasy stream,

This hot, algaic water in its long concrete trough.



Through chain-link holes we move

To the cement riverbank

With our tuna sandwiches

And learn that these mutant ducks

Escaped from Chinatown restaurants.



Sitting there, I get a voicemail from my old tenand

Saying, "I wish we could have tea again.

I wish we still lived upstairs.

I hope you're as happy as we are."

And I almost cry at her sweetness.



Later, under a broken bridge

On a sculptured heap of trash and sludge,

Our guide tells us,

"Only schizophrenics

See the beauty here."

### 5.【Annie Hall】5/7/5 Instructions From a Book Titled: Zen and the Art of Acting

An actor, I read,

Should wash the floor, hands and knees,

Before rehearsal.



This morning, I wiped

The tile, crawling with a sponge.

A spider ran off.

### 6.【human Cas】Morning, World

This morning, for no reason,

Or maybe for some territorial primate reason,

I felt compelled to open the front door

And survey my yard and steet

And waking neighborhood.

I stepped into the porch roof shadow,

With the line of early sunlight

Cutting just across my toes,

The manzanita eaves quaking to the breeze.

Down the block, a banging, rolling

Delivery truck door.

And without thinking,

I said out loud,

"I love you, world."

My feet on the cold concrete.

### 7. Negativity Bias

Years ago, I met a man at a dinner party,

A professor of literature

(We'll call him "Costya" to expose the guilty).

A fellow diner at the dinner asked about my idle time,

And I said I'd been writing some,

That I'd recently submitted poems

And that I hoped one may be printed for the public to review.

My new acquaintance, "Costya," asked,

"Why should anyone read what *you* write?"

The guests and I were slack-jawed at this cruwlty,

And, shaken, I stammered to retort.



But, with time, I have reflected.

Perhaps he meant to wonder:

Did I really have a purpose or a point?

Was I wasting readers' time?

Was I typing words for ego, or trying to be smart?



And now, ten years deep, I *could* say,

"I write to shake you, my dear readers,

And wake you from your slumber,

And show you a new way!"



But the truth is, I write mostly

In the mornings, drinking tea,

And, when I write, I am writing

Mostly just for me.



And Costya my dear Costya,

If you don't like it,

You may set this down at any time.

### 8. The Bell Curve

I invented a game in the tenth grade.

We would grade one another --

Not grade for tests or courses

Or even academic years,

But we'd assign letter values to

One another's whole person.



I gave an A- to Tassia

And then explained the reasons why:

She had a charming laugh and clever mind

But a bit too much self-doubt

To warrant her a solid A.



Leaning on the ping-pong table,

John, my oldest friend,

Rated me a crushing C.

**"You're too much of a dreamer,"**

Said he to me,

And the score has stuck.

I always think, *I'm drifting too much in my head*.



But here, rewriting old poems

By a window at my desk,

I have to say: that passing grade --

The dreamer's C --

It's good enough for me.

### 9. The Sound and The Ferry

On Lopez Island, we do not rise lazily in the morning.

Sunrise grabs us where we lie

(Outside on a mattress on a deck above the waves).

Daybreak is a drill sergeant daring us to defy it,

Yanking us from under our dew-damped sheets,

The fire of dawn raging in its irises,

Spitting sea breath so close we can taste mist,

Alarms of southbound geese blaring overhead,

And the foghorn *WAKE UP!* of a

Passing ferry in the sound.

The new day grabs us,

Shouting "rise" and "hear" and "see,"

And, springing up and looking out, we dare not disobey.

### 10.【destiel/Cas POV?】Downpour

"Time flies," and old friend told me today.

But maybe time slips through God's fingers,

Runs down His arms and legs,

And pools on the ground at His feet,

Each moment evaporating,

Condensing and falling back

To us as rain,

And the whole time, we think things like,

"Poor me,"

When instead

We could turn our bodies outdoors,

Feel the warm rain on our skin,

And watch the skies

Open for all of us.

### **11. Fire and Water**

Part One: Absolution

Many years ago, I got a phone call

With news that made me want to give up.

I sat and stared for an hour

And then took myself for a run

In Griffith Park, up through Little Armenia

Into the hills and chaparral.



When I rounded the liquor store,

Starting up Hillhurst, I saw plumes of smoke,

Heard sirens and helicopters, and felt hot wind.

I ran toward it all, **thinking the destruction might purify me.**



I passed the Greek theater and dozens

And dozens of fire trucks and hundreds of firemen

So consumed in suiting up,

Unfurling hoses, and saving structures

That none noticed a shirtless white boy bounding past.



I ran up onto a fire road

And toward the burning embers in the wind,

Pushing through near-tears and rounding an uphill turn.

A gust caught the fire's vanguard,

And I was suddenly running in a tunnel of fire

That swept over my head and across the path

And spread in every direction I looked.

**I thought: This is how I die.**



Just then, with a concussive pounding in my chest,

The thundering blade of a fire-fighting helicopter.

Cold and wet and steam overtook me as

I was baptized in a sooty rain of water from above.

I don't know if the pilot saw me or God did, but I felt

Reborn and washed in gratitude for this life.

## Longing, sadness, running & foreboding

### **1. Fire and Water**

Part Two: Pyreless

More than a decade past,

Southern California is burning again.

I waske feeling broken and

Once again wonder if my park might fix me.

I run up in an amber haze, the fires distant,

But the smoke and heat are sweeping in on coastal winds.

From Dante's Peak, I see

Bright spots burning through the haze

And LA County Fire copters dropping to collect

Water from the late that's dammed up in the hills.

Here in the park, though, I am far from water,

And I am damned.

Everything on this path is dry and hot and brown.

There's barely even wetness in my mouth.

At the peak, I stop and hold a fence post,

Light-headed from the smoke and sun and sadness.

**Today, I am not absolved, I am nor purified.**

I am the only runner in these hills.

### 2.【jenmish】Water Break

Running in Charlotte in a hot and sunny

Summer Sunday afternoon,

I saw an old man with a pit bull

Sitting on a lawn, brown and packed to dirt by dog's paws --

A veteran, I guessed -- one leg missing at the knee.

In the sticky heat, a radio on an extension cord,

Resting on a rusted metal chair,

Funk music on cheap speakers/



I stopped. Shirtless and sweat-soaked on my run,

I pointed to his garden hose coiled in the weeds:

"Can I get a drink of water? I'm dying in this heat."

He flicked one hand to say, *Okay,*

With a screw-top Bud Light in the other.



I crossed his yard, turned the water on, and let it run

So I wouldn't taste the sunbaked rubber.

I drank and drank, then thanked him.



He asked, intently, "What brings you here?

Where you going?"

As if I were running *to* something,

Or had a purpose or a plan.

"I'm just running," I said.

But as I trotted off, his questions stuck to me.

An insistence in his tone of voice,

As if he *knew* me and need me to ask myself,

*Why am I here? Where am I going?*

### 3.【human Cas】Black Cat

The other day, a cat passed through my hedge,

And I thought of a poem that would feature it,

But the poem took its course,

The hedge took center stage,

And the cat was written out of the script.



Last night, the cat came back/

A new cat in the neighborhood.

He brought two friends, one tailless

All mewing on my front porch.



A part of me thought

That the new cat knew

I had, in my poem,

Abandoned him for the leafy hedge,

And now he'd returned

With his henchmen.



When the screenching started, she

Lowered the *New Yorker* to her lap

And said, "What's going on with those cats?"

I peeled back the curtain

And saw a circle of fur.



Then, a spell of unease.

Not just the tingle of superstition

But a swelling, spinal fear

That these intruders

Might come for us in our sleep,

Take our souls and leave us cursed.

(appeared in *Columbia Poetry Review*, no. 32, Spring 2019)

### 4.【jenmish】Eugenia

In my yard, there's a kind of plant frowing

All along the fence; it's called a Eugenia.

And I want it to be a hedge

That blocks the lights of the liquor store.



But my Eugenia has grown to be a hedge-like tree,

With thick trunks and high branches

That nod in breezes.

And I can see the bright neon all night long.



Then, this summer, the bark began to bald,

With leaves wrinkled, pocked, and reddish,

So a plant specialist, an enthusiast, came to advise.

"A mite has invaded California," she told me.



"We're seeing this on Eugenia all over.

Don't worry, they've introduced a wasp,

And the wasp will eat the mites.

But if you want this to stay a hedge,

You've got to cut the leaders off the top there.

You see, your Eugenia

Wants to be a tree."

I told her, "I want it to be a hedge."



**I only wish I knew**

**What I wanted *me* to be.**

### 5.【jenmish breakup theory】Smog Cutters

Her let-me-save-you words,

Her lying on the couch in jeans.

We have to talk, let's connect,

Fell like shovelfuls of damp earth

Burying me alive.



Later, much later, at the That bar alone,

As I peeled whole barbecued shrimp

And drank Long Island iced tea like Lipton

To the sound of broken-English karaoke,

My muscles felt loosed from the bone,

And I cried shoulder-shaking tears.



Amidst the scents of whiskey and gin,

The oily husking of shrump,

And the That man's soul-saving song,

"West Virginia, take me home,"

The old woman who brought my drink

Touched my arm.



In the Christmas-lit bar,

**As I was slipping beneath the waves of despair,**

Her tender, mothering hand

Reached down and pulled me out,

And, somehow, I could breathe.

### 6.【jenmish breakup theory】These Days

I've been doing this funny thing in the afternoons,

This going and lying down

In our bed thing,

Slightly curled on my side

In my jeans and shoes,

Staring at the back side of the blinds,

**Crying.**



My puffed cheek soaks our pillow

And I cry.

No known reason --

Just tears on my side,

Slightly fetal,

Hidden,

**Sad to my bones.**

### 7.【cockles breakup theory】The Empty

Wine-tipsy, I crawl into the back porch guest bed,

The white duvet stiff with desert grit.

(In this windy, rainless LA summer,

You could shovel the deep dust

Off your windowsills.)



Face up and too hot to sleep,

My mind on day thoughts,

The night's city sky over-lit.

Above me, a bird taps

On the plastic roof,

Sound of a Harley revving at the bar.



I stretched my arms,

Spread my legs,

**So the bed's empty space**

**Won't feel so big.**

### 8.【jenmish breakup theory】I, Assassin

Now that summer reigns,

For days,

Itching, bloodsucking bites

From black fleas

Have welted my skin.



Hardware store.

Gas canisters.

Six hours.

Plumes of air-borne living room death.



The woman with the terrier said,

"They're in the grass in June.

You've got to 

Kill them where they live."



So, the lawn too.

A toxic wash.

Oily spray.

Foam.



And then,

At my feet,Shiny ladybugs

Running from their beds

Stumble, wings half-unfurled,

Horribly onto the flagstones.



**What have I done?**

### 9.【cockles】In My Hotel Bed

At the fancy hotel, the maids wear

A bleak, white maid's flock.

They fold down the sheets at six o'clock

And put away my underwear.



Last night, in my turned-down bed,

China's Olympics on the plasma display,

My wife rang for the fourth time that day

To say, "I know it's dumb, I just miss you.



Will you play the appreciation game?"

(It's a thing she likes to do where I say

Something nice about her brightening my day,

And then in her sweet way she does the same.)



**But I noticed a tightening in my chest,**

**A closing off and wanting rest,**

So I said, "no," and read instead

A poem I had written lying there in bed.

【-- Aug. 2008】

### 10. The Wrong Road

I had dinner yesterday with a dangerous woman

In a sushi restaurant. I am married, and

I could see sparkles in the makeup on her cheeks.

She told me secrets and left the tofu in her miso soup.



Dinner done, I wanted to pay and run, but

She asked me to walk her back to her hotel.

Her alone at night in a strange city, I couldn't say no.



In the lobby, she touched my arm

With forty years of loneliness.

I quickly said, "This was nice," and "Goodnight,"

And pushed hard on the revolving door,

Straining to be free.



Safe in the hotel driveway, I dropped my shoulders,

Opened my umbrella, and started for home.

Tree teenagers passed.

"Hey buddy," one said, "it's not raining anymore."

I looked out at the night's street

And saw patches where the pavement

Had already dried.

## My people (& other people)

### 1.【human Cas】The Feeling of Blue

Eating broccoli at the table in our kitchen,

I was staring at the row of frying pans

Dangling from their handles,

And out of nowhere she said,

**"Don't you love deep blue?"**

Some silence set in and she sid,

"Do you ever feel that way toward some people?

Like, Leigh is one of those people.

When I think of her, **she seems so human**

That I have the softest, softest sweetness toward her,

And sometimes I feel that way with strangers."



I just looked at her with open eyes,

And we weren't drunk,

And we weren't high.

(Unless steamed greens

Can make you high).

### **2.【destiel adapt】Wild Flower**

Sunday, we drove up two hours

To see the poppies bloom

With a close friend

**(An almost lover)**

Who still left me tongue-tied,

Her pretty legs

Stretched across the back seat in the high desert.

She told us about rain

And why the blossoms are

Brighter some years.

Driving, I searched for words

**To convey a feeling**

**(Maybe longing),**

But nothing came.



At a gas station,

Asking directions,

I waited while a blushing man

Paid for condoms

And a Sunday *Times.*



In the car again,

Drowsing from a sleepless night,

I thought of all the things I didn't say,

Until we crested a sandstone ridge

And all at once, curving to the downhill side,

The blinding California poppies

Swept the desert valley



In orange and green

As far as we could see.

Finally finding my words,

I said, "Look.

Look at all those flowers."

### 3. Alessandra

I saw her in the airport last year

Looking just the same.

We traded emails, and I

learned her new last name.



This weekend, dressed smartly,

I found the place early and ordered a big bottle

Of sparkling water. She came late,

Kissed both cheeks, and ordered "still."



We shared chestnut chicken and aubergine,

A linen-serviced Chinese lunch in London.

Her American dialect was clipped and neat;

She didn't glottalize her *t*'s.



She's friends, she said, with Bill and Hillary

But had a recent falling out with

The ambassador to France.



Her bangs were the same, and somehow

She got me talking about my mother

Like she used to, when we sat in the stone-walled

Bedroom of our freshman dorm.



"I just know I *need* to be successful," she declared.

As I balanced my chopsticks on a chestnut on my plate,

I thought of all the sadness in that phease,

And how I once was tempted by this woman and her yearning

For what she couldn't have.

### 4. The Commuter

I have a man, paid for by Warner Brothers,

Who drives me to work.

See that?! I didn't want to say it...

I HAVE A DRIVER.

And yes, it's as strange as it sounds.

He comes around to open my door.



At first, I objected,

But now I see it as it is:

I want to be my best at my work

And he at his.

We play our roles.



In his car, I used to

Force a conversation

To disguise us as

Just two guys carpooling.



Now we mostly sit in silence

Unless we *have* to talk.

Like last night,

When he said, "I wouldn't want that job,"

As we passed a prostitute

In stilettos and fishnets

Shivering on the sidewalk in the snow.

### 5. Marder

I'm quarantined in Chicago

In a freezing February Airbnb

Feeling sorry for me as I

Recover from left hop surgery.



I got an email from an old college friend.

"I know you knew Andreas from basketball," he wrote.

"His wife wanted me to let people know

He passed away this week. Still only in his forties."



Earlier this morning, I read a Mary Oliver poem

About her friend Tom, who die.

He had decades kept her warm, she wrote,

**A "friendship always as beautiful as a flame."**



You, Dar, and all our growing up together came to mind,

And the icy tears years from now,

Whenyou or I will die before the other.

The bone-chilling cold

Of being in this world without you.

### **6.【jenmish/destiel Cas POV!!】Men in Woods**

My new friend proposed

A day and night of camping --

"Sleeping under the stars," he called it.

And I wondered, maybe worried just a bit:

Would he try to kiss me again?

Did he want to hike with me because he liked me?

Or was it that he *liked* me?



How triumphant I felt on our twelve-mile

Walk along the ridges, when we talked about

How we hoped to start a band,

And when I laughed and called him a "whiner"

For his complaints about his knee

(And the altitude and the heat).



We both wore old sneakers and slipped on the trail.

And when we skinny-dipped in a shallow stream,

We noticed, each in the other's body,

That our grown-man bellies didn't match our

Boyish downhill jogs.



In the car, when I asked who the music was,

He turned it up, showing off

The speakers in his new car.

We listened, wind-chapped, to the CD.

He's going to burn me a copy.

## The parents

### 1. Housekeeping

For the first time in three years,

I've come, from California to the New England hills,

To see my mother

For just two days.

She lives alone, and the wood floors in her house

Have swollen and buckled

From the summer's endless humidity.

She called me to her room ronight:

"Come look. Come see."

I stopped in the doorway,

Watched her toss treats to her dog,

So proud when he would catch and chew.

Her room strewn with clothes,

The blond dog misses:

"What's the matter, buttercup?

You're so tired."

And she kneels down

On the stained blue carpet,

Already forgetting I am there.

### 2. Old Bones

This morning,

The smell of bacon

Brought me downstairs,

But before I reached

The open kitchen door,

A voice stopped me.



My mother telling

Her old, arthritic dog,

"I know sweetness,

You've been carrying those bones

For a long time."



I leaned unseen

On the mildewed windowsill,

Watching her

Sip coffee,

Fry bacon.



Her old dog

Pressing at her knee.

(appeared in *Columbia Poetry Review*, no. 21, Spring 2007)

### **3.【Misha Dean】The Fly**

My mother, sixty-three, has lost weight

And looks happy when I see her.



Yesterday, for her birthday surprise, we took her sailing.

She sailed with her father in the '50s,

Won a regatta with him when she was seventeen.



Our aging captain has earrings and a nose ring

A hops boyishly on board.

He's so happy that we came

And tells us which is the jib and which the mainsail.



When he bends to take a line

His unzipped fly folds open,

And I see his penis swing out.

I say nothing

Because he's tucked his shirt in today

And worn nice shoes

And wants us to notice

How well-kept his boat is.



**Since I was four,**

**I've been parent to my little world,**

**Taking care of mom and brother,**

**Taking pains not to**

**Rub anyone the wrong way**

**Or make them feel bad,**

**No matter how bad I feel.**



Now I'm in my forties

And I can't even say,

"Hey man, your fly's undone."

### 4. Taxi

There's this long cab ride

After she's stayed with me

Four days for her birthday.

She's sixty-two.

She inhales to gather courage in the cab

To broach the big stuff

Before she flies away.



All weekend, she's been telling big stories

Full of hyperbole, maybe hoping,

If she opens her eyes wide

And gestures wildly enough,

That that parade of it all might ignite me.



I read it takes an atomic bomb

To trigger a hydrogen bomb.

This visit, she's been Nagasaki

While I've been a cool four-day drizzle.

When I hear myself speak,

I don't recognize the boy;

I'm somewhere else,

A bored tour guide,

Waiting for the weekend's end.



In the cab,

She's just finished telling me

She hopes I still have children someday.



I tap the vinyl of the seat next to me,

And, mistaking it for a reach,

She takes my hand.



I freeze, then squeeze back

And whisper, "I love you."

### 5. Town Car

When I was a kid, my mother collected food stamps.

Now I complain that she brags about me too much.

There's a photo on her mantle of the president and me.

She tells everyone who visits that I've been on TV

And published poems. It nettles at me.



Last night, I made dinner on my new, high-end barbecue grill

For my mother and her two friends.

I lit candles, but when she started to say,

In a stagelike whisper,

That I built this fine home, with its high skylights,

I halted her with a singsong teenage "Mom!"



This morning, we both had flights, so in a fancy gesture

I took her to the airport in a tinted town car

With a pinstriped driver who held her cane.

Sitting next to me,

She told me she wished we had a

Better connection

And that she no longer thought my wife wasn't

Good enough

But still hoped she would make me a father someday.



And I thought:

Maybe she isn't so impressed by the car

And by the driver

And the legroom and the leather.

All wasted.

And now I'm hours early for my flight.

### 6. The Driver

Crossing Maine in his minivan in the dark

To a town called Bath,

We never knew what to say to one another.

We pass lighted lobster shacks and outlet malls,

The sound of wet tires on highway

Fills in for the unspoken words.



He munches steadily through a

Big bag of Doritos.

He's always had something

Crunchy at the ready on the road.



He's always had a van too.

I remember, at three or four, staring up at his

Fringers wrapped around the wheel,

His face weighted with loneliness,

Just before my mom

Moved us away from him.

Peanuts rattling

In the console on the dash.



Now, sitting here full grown,

I'm staring still at his big hands.

Knowing that they'll keep me safe.

## The kids

### 1. Baby Pants

I drive across town for a friend

To Justin's house on a Saturday at 9 A.M.

His wife, belt unbuckled, yells for him from under wet hair.

He's down in the office,

And I collapse on the new couch,

Custom made, brown and squarer than a couch should be.



Justin's baby produces baby pants for my inspection.

I'm inmpressed that he can find his own pants now.

Can't put them on but knows they go

On his baby legs.



And there I am with my friend's family

On another weekend morning.

The mother holds an envelope in her teeth,

Hoists and struggles to pant her boy.



I'm slouching hot in my vest,

My blue down vest,

Thinking today was colder than it is.

Forgetting that fall in California

Is like summer back home.



Plastic diapers pack the thighs of tiny corduroys.

The smell of Cheerios bloated and floating in milk.

What have I missed?



*\* This is the first poem I ever wrote.*

(appeared in *Columbia Poetry Review*, no. 21, Spring 2008)

### 2. The Visit

My godson's dad

Lives in Michigan,

Doesn't answer the phone.



Little Joey came to

Visit me at work yesterday.

We ate pork tacos;

He desserted on Yoplait.



On the drive home,

He told his mom

It was the best day of his life.



So I am a six-year-old's man:

Two little eyes watching me

To see how he should be.

### 3. Junk Mail

The tenants at my old house

Saved my mail in a box --

Returned Christmas cards,

Expired Home Depot coupons,

And a copy of *Pearl*,

A poetry journal, with

A thing about flowering trees

Written by me.

I reread it in the kitchen

Over the open box of bulk mail.

It says that my wife

Has been waiting for the trees to flower

Or maybe for something else,

And now twenty years after we first kissed

We have a baby on the way.

Maybe this

Is what we've been waiting on

All these years?

### 4. The Seal

We're calling it "The Seal"

Because last week

The sonogram

Had a fishlike look

When we saw the pixelated

Heartbeat on the screen.



A new doctor has squeezed us in

On short notice because of the bleeding.

Standing with forceps in her scrubs,

She does not trade in comfort.

She talks of biopsies, irregularities, and worst cases.



I squeeze your hand and wipe the hair

That has sweated to your face.

You look to me, cheeks swollen with fear;

I try to soothe with a flat joke,

"Quite a party, huh?"

I steady the spinning room

By pressing the table with my knee.

### 5. The Nest

One clung sleeping to your chest,

Another climbed from the empty hamper,

Hair blue and wet, declaring, "Upside Up!"



Tonight, our minds race

Side by side,

The broken day of the broken dishwasher,

And I have to fly back to Canada tomorrow.



When will sleep ever meet us?

Can we find, on our 22nd Valentine's,

Twenty conjugal minutes?

Or will we die

In this heap of little bodies,

Worrying the dark away?

### 6. Present. Tense.

Their mother is two days away for the first time,

And we are midway through our first afternoon.

I'm standing impatient on the grass near other new parents

As my five-year-old, West, dangles his weight

From a toy steering wheel bolted to the slide.

"Chase me, Dad!"

But I'm seeing what important things

Have happened on my iPhone.



I remember when I was small,

Taking my father's big fingers,

Gripping them in my little fist,

And feeling invincible.



Maison, my toddler, is yawning in the wood chips,

So I give the "five-minute warning"

Because I've read that small children have

Hard times with transitions.

Their days, of course, are packed with transitions,

So their life is filled with anxious warnings

From adults who always want them to be

Somewhere other than where they are.



I'm ready for the next thing, ready to be done with slides.

And besides, their five minutes are up, so

I tug them by the hands to our minivan in the parking lot,

And as I'm buckling Maison in her car seat,

She sees a flower on the curb that's gone to see.



"Dad, I want the dandelion,"

In her three-year-old dialect.

Sighing, I stoop and pick one for each of us

And one for the absent mother.

And congratulate myself on my patience.



I ask my son to make a wish for his mom.

I say, "Maybe a long, happy life."

He blows dandelion for his mother into the car.

I think of themess, of how the little seeds will stick to the seats.

Then he blows his own wish:

"I wish for a baby leopard."



Walking around the car, I make my own wish

**That I won't wake up someday and wonder where my life went,**

**That I will somehow find my way to happiness.**



And now it's Maison's turn.

She starts pulling the white fluff off with her fingers.

I say, "No, no, sweetie," and West explains:

"You have to puff it and make a wish."

Then she smilingly blows the wisps from off the stem,

And as they float toward me, she says,

**"I wish for this."**

### 7. The Last Poem

My seven-year-old still crawls out of his bed and into ours

Every night between eleven and three,

The relocation wakes his little sister, and she comes too,

Crying, still half-dreaming, down the unlit hall.

"Mama, Dadda, where are you?!"

"Right here, little one. In bed. In our bed.

Where we always are."



Four rib-jabbing, perpendicular little legs.

Coughs and whimpers in the dark.

My daughter soothes herself terribly

By fingernail-pinching my nipples.



After an hour or two of fitful wrestling in our nest,

Warmth and wetness wake me.

I get one of our thick, gray towels, spread it

Across the pee-damped portion of the sheets,

And try angrily to find a way to get back to my sleep.



But this morning, far from home,

I wake alone in my own rented bed, revived by rest.

*This*, I think, *is what it feels like to have slept.*

And I decide that upon return I will announce:

"The children are old enough -- past due

To sleep in their own beds.

We can't live as ghosts like this!"



Lying there in the quiet and the still

For longer than I have in years

In this empty room with

One little window,

I drift to those half-naked, warm little ones

Nuzzling under my grown-man arms,

Making pillows of my shoulders,

Recounting the sounds of their sleep,

Sniffle-snoring through those tiny, running little noses.



And I wonder:

*What have I missed?*

One night soon they will sigh their last

Sleeping breath of childhood,

And when they do,

I want to be pressed close and alert

To breath it in and hold it

In my body forever.

## Acknowledgements

This is the near-end page where I list the people who helped me write this book. First, I want to thank the people I love who are mentioned in these poems as well as the handful of people who read my manuscript and gave me notes (there is overlap between the two groups). I also want to note that there are people I love -- my sisters, Danielle and Liz, my Sasha, Philip, Susan, and my grandmother, to name a few -- who deserve whole chapters in the book of my life, but whom I did not substantially write about in these pages.

Many of my poems are bout my wife -- the most important grown-up in my life. After thirty years together, we have separated, but she will always be woven into the fabric of me, and I am forever grateful for her. I cried many times rereading the pages about her. My love for her will always remain.

Thank you to Matt Thomas, my dear college friend and an incredible author, who encouraged me and patiently worked through early drafts line by line, comma by comma.

Thank you to Karina White, my longtime creative collaborator for her cover design and photo of the LA skyline and for her friendship and devotion to font perfection.

Thank you to my agents, Byrd Leavell and Meredith Miller, who worked hard to find this book the best publishing team even though books of poems have made no agent any dollars, ever. Thank you to Patty Rice, my editor, whom it feels like I've known my whole life after just three months, and thank you to everyone at Andres McMeel Publishing.

I also want to thank my mother and father. The poems in this book don't highlight the virtues of my childhood, but when I was small, my parents tricked me into believing that I could do whatever I wanted with my life and that I deserved to be listened to. Thank you for that subterfuge.

And finally, thank you, West and Maison. Some days I feel that my whole purpose in being was to share this life with you. Watching you grow is my greatest happiness.
