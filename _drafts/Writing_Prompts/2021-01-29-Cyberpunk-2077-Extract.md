[TOC]

### 4. 强尼帮V去找奥特帮忙

“Relax, I'll handle it.”

“You have to save her.”

在奥特介绍“灵魂杀手”的程序是把V杀死一次再重新注入的时候，强尼听不下去：“靠，别说了，我不想听。让V直接返回她的身体，其他的一律不变，可以吗？”

### 5. 互相能看到对方的过去和记忆

强尼：“没错，我能看到你的过去，就像你也能看到我的一样。”

（互相信任了解）

### 6. 强尼救V

V不止一次因为有强尼在所以死不了，还能系统重启，而且重启后第一眼看见的总是强尼。

强尼还会关心她：“嘿，V？没事儿吧？”

（是真的关心她）

（二设：强尼其实可以选择不救V，或者自己占据这具身体，但他没有这么做。他可以不考虑V的死活，但他选择想办法救她。）

（如果没有强尼，V已经死过无数遍了，各种意义上）

（如果这还不是爱）

### 7. 互相关心

平时互相斗嘴嫌弃，但是如果突然话说到一半听不见对方声音了会互相担心，V会慌乱地到处找强尼（但是周围人看不见强尼所以不知道V怎么了）

### 8. 用揶揄的口吻征询意见

准备去见奥特之前，V问强尼：“强尼？他们拿你当诱饵啊，你同意吗？”

只要能救V，强尼不介意自己被利用

### 10. 主线中帕南剧情部分

强尼：“嗯，或许我们两个能合得来。”

“知道吗？你让我想起自己了……五十年前的自己。”

“管他什么动机。为达目的就要不择手段。**而现在，你的目的就是活下来。**”

在执行任务过程中 强尼担心V：“V！快出来！芯片会出问题的！”

V（玩笑）：“谢谢你提醒。我本来还想去野餐来着，或者去沙滩躺会儿，晒个一身黑……”

强尼（难得严肃，在关于V的安全问题上不开玩笑）：“给我严肃点。当心，下一个有可能——”

（强尼突然消失）

V（也突然不开玩笑了，惊慌）：“强尼？强尼！？”

强尼（重新出现，还是假装暴躁）：“OK，我没事儿。你，快滚出来。”

### 11. “I got you”

（来自主线章节“裂头蚴”）

V：强尼……我要死了……

强尼：你死不了的。有我在。（You ain't dying yet, I got you.）

（醒来以后手里拿着药罐）

V：强尼……

强尼：是海风的咸味儿。起来吧，这会儿的太平洋可是最美的。

V：唉……刚刚差点儿就交代了。

强尼：差点（Almost）。

### 12. 挡子弹梗

强尼：你会为我挡子弹吗？

V：会/不会/不知道/傻问题

强尼：今天我就告诉你——我不会对不起你。等时候到了，我会同意被删除，咱们一命换一命。

### 13. 心脏旁的针刺感

（在一次Relic故障之后）

V：我好点儿了，差不多该走了。

强尼：还是觉得你心脏旁边有点扎得慌。

V：我估计是好不了了吧。

（其实是爱情的感觉x）

### 14. 守护天使

（强尼把V的身体送到维克多地方，在维克多问话的时候）

强尼（悄声）：告诉他你有个守护天使。

（可用于宗教AU）

### 15. 恶魔结局（摘抄）

你的未来就是他的未来，反之亦然。——米斯蒂

Same drive (to live) that kept Silverhand goin' his whole life. That drive and two thoughts - never look back, never look to those around you. Just keep movin', look ahead, stare Death straight in the eye.（V: You're not the only rebel around here.）And I'm not the only one to have missed the bigger picture. We're a tangled web, you and me - one and the same. So if you're here to tell me somethin', it's 'cause you need to hear it yourself.——强尼

我们犹如一张交织的网，早已合二为一。——强尼

They're cuttin' a piece of us out, and that'll leave a hole. Forever.——强尼

V：What choice did I have?

强尼：Stay true to yourself? Give a thought to a tiny concept called loyalty? It's not about Arasake. Not even about life and death. 

V：Then what's it all about, Johnny? Enlighten me.

强尼：The principle, V. It's always about the principle. Swap meat for chrome, live a BD fantasy, whatever - but at the end of it all, it's the code you live by that defines who you are. Ever get lost, it shows you the way home. Bust up into pieces, it puts you back together again.

V：That Rockerboy Silverhand's credo, words he lived by?

强尼：Somethin' Johnny picked up from V - the old V.

一个灵魂如何选择自己的人生，这是一幅值得期许的景象。时而可怜，时而可笑，也有美妙而新奇的时刻。在大多数情况下，灵魂都是根据前世的习惯做出的选择。——大脑测试时的阅读片段

这座城市就像流沙，挣扎得越厉害，陷得越深。等淹过了膝盖，你就再也出不去了。——朱迪

今天，科学技术填补了宗教曾经许诺下的空白——新闻（→宗教AU/美国众神AU（？））

### 17. 词语联想测试梗（恶魔结局 延伸）

“根据关键词做出应答，说出最先想到的词”

旅行：强尼、生命、奥德赛、自由、轨道

家：强尼、这座城市、什么都没想到、一幢高楼、死亡

敌人：强尼、我、这座城市、荒坂、反叛、死亡

原则：强尼、我、荒坂、这座城市、反叛、我不知道

背叛：强尼、我、荒坂、这座城市、原则、我不知道

疾病：我、强尼、生命、这座城市、死亡、不知道

反叛：我、强尼、生命、死亡、什么都没想到、我不知道

我，自己（I, me）：强尼、空虚、死亡、转变、孤独、我不知道

当前（the present）：地狱、虚无、荒坂、孤独（solitude）、死亡、没想法

未来：不知道（no idea）、荒坂、这座城市、没想法、反叛、死亡

忠诚：强尼、荒坂、我、背叛、我不知道

人性：强尼、荒坂、我、什么都没有、没想法

————

结果想到的大多是和强尼相关的，但在回答公司测试时都说的是第二个相关词，但其实强尼仍然在脑子里。等到测试结束时强尼问V为什么没说实话，V说这是为了保护他，她再也不会做这种把他赶走的事情了，在为他找到一副更好的躯体之前，他就继续呆在她的脑子里，哪儿也不准去。强尼：非常乐意。

### 18. 【杰克】《丧钟为谁而鸣》——海明威

It's ok to die, but before that, love the life, don't be afraid of it.

“杰克热爱生活，浑身是胆。他心胸坦荡，从来不会瞻前顾后，一向说干就干。”——V

### 20. 各结局汇总整理

**通用牌面：**

\- 愚者：代表一段旅程的开始，预示新事物的来临。是内心的孩童，对世界充满好奇，既天真又鲁莽。（=最初的V）

\- 魔术师（逆位）：一个极富天赋与魅力的人，一个领袖（=强尼）这张牌在逆位，意味着某种成瘾倾向，精神不太稳定

#### （1）恶魔结局

吃阻断药暂时赶走强尼；跟华子合作，荒坂三郎通过荒坂赖宣的身体重生，富人从此都能奴役穷人的身体和灵魂了；接受荒坂的手术但手术失败，只剩两种选择：以意识体形式把灵魂出卖给公司，或回到地球只剩六个月生命。（非常心里添堵的结局）

**牌面：**

\- 恶魔（逆位）：强势征服、失去掌控，侵犯、邪恶、对权力的争夺→是个警告 （=V的结局）

\- 月亮：代表的是神秘，看不透的未来（=强尼的结局）

（留言里的牌面：）愚者、月亮、女祭司：这些都不是好兆头。

#### （2）星星结局

吃阻断药暂时赶走强尼；跟帕南和阿德卡多流浪者、奥特合作，直接冲进荒坂大楼连入神舆（索尔牺牲）；奥特用灵魂杀手分离了V和强尼的意识体，但V的身体与V的意识体不能兼容，强行回归只能再活六个月。V选择了跟流浪者一起离开夜之城去恶土再活六个月，跟帕南一起看星星。（很喜欢这个结局！）

**牌面：**

\- 恋人：平衡，友谊，爱情，但也可能意味着未来有艰难的抉择（=V的结局）

\- 月亮：代表的是神秘，看不透的未来（=强尼的结局）

（留言里的牌面：）战车、恋人、太阳：往后在恶土的日子会过得不错

#### （3）节制结局

前面同星星结局，在神舆和奥特面前选择时自己跟奥特走，强尼回到她原本的身体继续生活下去。强尼想念V、承认V对他非常重要，活得也很像V了，给一个喜欢音乐的小男孩买了最好的吉他，离开了夜之城。（还算喜欢这个结局）

**牌面：**

出发前的牌面同星星结局

（留言里的牌面：）倒吊人、魔术师、星星：这些都不是什么好牌，真的很糟糕……和死亡差不多，但又不完全一样。

#### （4）太阳结局

吃伪内三嗪让强尼掌控身体；强尼跟罗格、奥特合作（罗格牺牲），连接进神舆；放弃身体的控制权，让V回到身体里，代替罗格成为来生的Queen，成了大人物；V跟蓝眼睛先生合作进入太空一个人干翻水晶宫。（对V来说很不错的结局）

**牌面：**

（留言里的牌面：）力量、皇帝、世界：V的名字会响遍全世界

#### （5）自杀结局

（个人还挺喜欢的结局）

#### （6）隐藏结局

跟强尼一起solo打荒坂，连入神舆；身体跟V的意识体不兼容，支线可选，如果身体让给强尼则回到节制结局，如果V回到身体里则回到太阳结局（区别在于没人死），成为来生的Queen；进入太空准备干翻水晶宫。（跟强尼高甜！）

（留言里的牌面同太阳结局）

### 24. 星星结局（摘抄）

灵魂杀手并没有改变他（强尼），没有让他失去“人类因素”。这正是为何他觉得自己能重塑你的意志。——奥特

你无论存在或不存在，都是由死亡分开的两种状态。——奥特

你的代码，你的神智……活在现实边界之外的人工智能，他们将会永生（但并非长生不死）——V（→这是否是“活着”？解决方案：用立法赋予“意识体”以生者的权利（来避免变成把灵魂卖给荒坂）？）

你总想寻找简单但并不存在的答案。你的世界也构建在这个幻想上。此时此刻，你该接受任何让你感觉更好的答案。——奥特

在神舆，你的感知会碎成无数条未过滤数据的字符串。你会看见一个要跨越的界限。很有可能，你会在那唯一的时刻，感受到自己存在的真实重量。一种令你措手不及的负担。——奥特（→黑客帝国AU，《超验骇客》）

（联想：）“I don't want to die alone.”“What about side by side with a friend.”——LOTR

我们陪你，V，直到世界尽头。——索尔（代表帕南及阿德卡多所有人）

Good luck, V, be free.——米丝蒂

### 25. 节制结局（摘抄）

过去这些日子里，有银手在身边，我学会了冲破阻碍。现在什么也不能阻挡我 了。我能感受到。——V（→“你让我变得更勇敢”）

别这么做，V。你一直在努力避免这种结果（指身体给强尼）。你会变成另一个人，再也不是你自己。——强尼（→“但如果这另一个人是你，我没有什么好担心的了”）

你决定听天由命，放弃自己争取的一切，放弃自己的生命，就因为你不敢跟我说再见？——强尼（→“不是放弃自己的生命，你不是还会在我的身体里继续活下去么”）

（强尼反复劝V不要把身体让给他，希望V活下去）

（强尼刚刚回来：）我永远习惯不了。I gotta stop talking to you, V.——强尼

（回来之后的第一件事：）我还有点儿时间，应该可以到你那儿去看看。——强尼

绝望的人可是会出事的。——强尼

反正音乐就在你身体里，就像血液， 一直都在。——强尼

音乐是你写给别人的礼物，不仅仅是为自己。——强尼

真正的反叛需要时间来沉淀。/真正的反叛即是真实。——强尼

灵魂杀手面临的指控：精神绑架，人格折磨，冒充上帝（play God）——新闻

这城市像是活的，就好像我们创造了一头怪物，却一直没发现自己已经被它生吞了。——强尼

这里确实很美（我来过这里但从来没注意过），一直没时间坐下来，好好看看。这城市就这样从我指尖溜走，转瞬即逝。从脚下滑过，从头顶掠过，都说不清是什么时候。——强尼（→开始热爱生活）

（关于挂坠：）“挂坠挺漂亮，你戴着很好看。”“只是个纪念品”“是你重要的人的？”“是啊，非常重要的人。”“那你要拿它干嘛？”“让它物归原主。”

（把子弹挂坠送回到墓地：）你知道，不能再这样下去了。沉湎于过去不好，人不能总活在回忆里。反正我想忘也忘不掉你了，一照镜子就都是你的脸。我不知道还有谁有胆量，做出这样的决定……不知道还有谁。谢谢你……嗯，所做的一切。我想明白了很多事，不会再走错了。所以这是再见。——强尼

（珍惜V的身体：戒烟）我已经戒了。对身体不好。对灵魂更不好。——强尼（→《小王子》“水对灵魂也是有好处的”“It's good to have a friend, even when you're going to die.”）

“你刚刚去看的人。他死了很久了？”“是她。也没有很久。”“你想她吗？”“是啊，有一点儿。”

### 27. 节制结局 强尼与V旧友的关系

（强尼放弃吉他和音乐，放弃一切离开夜之城之后）

（语音留言：）

朱迪：Pick up, pick up, pick- Fuck! V.. I - I don't know where we went wrong... maybe something happened, or you needed to lay low... If you can... just give me s-some kinda signal that... that you're alive and everything's OK... please... And if you ever need help, you know I'm here for you, right? Always. Stay safe... and call me when you hear this.

帕南：Really? You're just gonna avoid me? Of course you would, you fucking coward. Here's a bit of advice for you, Johnny. Enjoy your new lease on life. 'Cause it's not gonna last long. I'm serious. Believe me when I say I'm going to find you, you fucking psychopath - wherever you're hiding. And when I do, I'm gonna rip V out of your head. Don't ask me how, but so far I'm counting on sheer will. You know what you are, Johnny? A parasite. A fucking tapeworm! You hear me?! Enjoy the little time you have left. Ptoo!

克里：Hey, V, it's me again. Still not pickin' up, huh? Can't stand uncomfortable convos? Hmph... coward. You know, I've been through my fair share of shitty breakups. Guy once dumped me by text, cause another balls deep in some other piece of ass... But what YOU went and pulled... vanishing into thin air, not answerin' calls, no letters, pretendin' nothin' happened between us... just - wow. You've really set the bar low. So congrats. You really are one-of-a-kind after all. 

瑞弗：V, hey. So I've been to every precinct in the city, every hospital, emergency room, every single ripperdoc... nobody knows what happened to you. It's like you're a ghost. If that job went sour then I guess... I guess that's it, then. But if everythin' went like it was supposed to, V... if you're alive... just call me, please. You owe me that much. Anyway, uh... Bye, I guess.

维克多：Hey, V. I know you're a free bird and all, you're gonna do what you want, when you want... But you could at least let me know you're alive, you know? I - I don't wanna say anything, but you missed your last checkup, and like I told you a million times... Ugh... Just call when you can, OK? See ya.

罗格：Got your message. Johnny, look - I've been around long enough to know anything is possible in your fucked up world... but I never imagined this, even from you. You must've made a pretty big impression on V for getting her on board with this, so hats off. I'm just wondering how you feel about that, Johnny - havin' another person give their life for you. Specially when you're probably just back to all-nighters and cheap tequila, laughing at how stupid she was? Or has your conscience finally learned its lesson - that is, if you've even got one... Good luck out there, Johnny. And don't ever come back to Night City.

你的信息我收到了。强尼，听着，我早就知道，在你那个变态的世界里，一切都有可能……但我真没想到有人能做出这种事，哪怕是你。V一定是对你死心塌地，这才会同意。真是够了不起的啊。我就想知道你内心是什么感觉，强尼——让又一个人为了你失去生命。尤其是在你通宵鬼混，喝着便宜的龙舌兰的时候，说不定还会笑她脑子不好使是不是？或者你终于能够良心发现——如果你还有良心的话……祝你好运，强尼。再也别回夜之城了。

（“太潇洒的人，内心都是苦的/broken的”）

（强尼这样的人，表现的不在乎，心里其实很在乎）

### 29. 太阳结局（摘抄）

如果你还不想死……那就得活下去。——强尼

（强尼想要选择让V活下去：V阻止了←跟星星/节制结局的区别：选择权在强尼，而强尼不可能选择让自己活）

他们说你太冒险了。说得浪漫一点儿，就是向着太阳飞去，迟早会燃成灰烬。——蓝眼睛先生

### 30. 自杀结局（摘抄）

强尼：现在你要放弃？为什么？

V：这是最干净，流血最少的办法。其他任何尝试，都会死人的。

强尼：总会死人的。这世道就这样。

V：那我值得他们丧命吗？你值得吗？

V：而且，只有这样完美才能都感觉到。（只要有你在身边，我便无所畏惧。我唯一不想要的，就是孤独地走到最后。其他任何结局，我们都要面临你死我活的选择，我不想这样。“我和你一起，走到最后”）

强尼：感觉什么？死亡？

V：嗯哼。生命离开的那一刻。

（强尼坐到了V身边）

强尼：唔，我还从没想过这个。到现在，你还能时不时给我个惊喜。

V：也许是从你身上学的吧。

强尼：V，你确定要这么做吗？

V：是的，只要你不反对。

强尼：Not how I'd done it, but that's alright.

V：就这样？怎么不跟我对着干？

强尼：呵，也许我也从你身上学到了点什么东西吧。

强尼：确定现在吗？（Is it time?）

V：你看，这里真的很美。

强尼：跟你在一起很开心，V。

V：嗯，我也一样，强尼……

### 32. 其他零碎的摘抄

人生因为孤独，而变得没有意义。——帕南

真正的男人离不开目标、爱和梦想。——V

我从小就喜欢火车，还有车站，看无数轨道交汇。还有如果从上面俯视，你会觉得……自由，就像说走就走，踏上几千次旅程？可能更简单——能看到希望。——帕南

艺术是容器，是情绪的开关。而超梦就是最纯粹的情感表现形式。——朱迪

我不需要这个世界，我需要你。——强尼

（V：我以为跟克里一起演出对你很重要。）是很重要。但是没有你重要。克里的人生又活了，接下来该想想你的人生要怎么走了。——强尼

（V：跟公司解约你就自由了。）你是说真的吗（Seriously）？唱到脸色发青都没人听，这种自由有什么用？无非是牢笼换了一种形式罢了。——克里

睡着的时候觉得自己很特别，醒来发现你什么都不是。也就只有这儿了。——强尼

### 33. 克里支线（TODO）

有没有觉得在这座城市里根本没有选择？要么焚烧殆尽，要么就根本没你这个人。……我本来以为怕被别人觉得自己是公司的奴隶。其实我怕的是再次笼罩在别人的阴影里。……每天起床都是同一个念头——我总有一天会被这座城市吞没，永远地消失在它的乌烟瘴气里。夜之城就是一座充满阴影的城市。这么多年来，我费尽心思想要摆脱它们，靠。——克里

还记得你在垃圾场刚醒过来吗？他现在也一样——带着“世界我去你的”的心态重生了。——强尼

### 34. 跟强尼的对话（很甜）（TODO）

（How's life in my body?）Well, most things're either too big or too small. Not to mention the clusterfuck that're your hormones. And the lag between sight and touch - infuriating. When you take a bite of pizza, takes ages before I know you fuckin' burned the roof of your mouth. Plus, used to be five minutes wouldn't pass 'fore I had a fresh cig in my hand, now I'm itchin' for nicotine. Gettin' used to it, I guess, but its' no fuckin' picnic.——强尼（延迟的感知，无法及时保护，会心疼，迟到的保护欲）

（My memories - what do they... feel like? Aside from what you see and hear, I mean. You process or experience any feelings?）Anger, regret, bitterness, fear. Though honestly, can't tell if they're yours or mine.——强尼

### 35. 墓地高甜对话（遍历各种支线）

强尼：So that's how it is. Nothing here at all.

V：What'd you expect? Headston, flag and flowers?

强尼：Nah, I... I dunno. A marker? Something, anything.

V：Really need symbolic, empty gestures?

强尼：Guess I do. Thought I'd feel like I'd closed a chaper here. Like I'd said goodbye to the old Silverhand, hello to the new.

V：And how *do* you feel?

强尼：Like I never even was. Or like I was still inside Mikoshi.

V：We'll figure something out. [Inscribe Johnny's initials] Better now?

强尼：A bit. But let's say it was my real grave - what would you write? "Here lies Johnny Silverhand -- "

#### （1）摇滚小子

V："Relentless Rockerboy Who Never Surrendered." Not even in death.

强尼：Thanks. But what's that do for me now? What'd I achieve fighting Arasaka? So many dead - and those suits're still on top.

(1.1)

V：Won't win this war goin' solo. Might be a good thing we're in this together.

强尼：That's just it. Don't wanna drag you down into this swamp with me.

(1.2)

V：Just feeling sorry for yourself.

强尼：No. Just finally thinking clearly.

(1.3)

V：What's gotten into you all of a sudden? Where's Johnny I'm-the-fuckin'-greatest Silverhand? Don't even recognize you.

强尼：Maybe I'm done pretending.

#### （2）夜之城传奇

V："Night City Legend."

强尼：Sounds good. But what does it really mean? What did I achieve, shouting "Chippin' In" to a bunch of angry, pimply kids?

(2.1)

V：Ya gave those kids hope. That the suits couldn't buy everything.

强尼：I remember what I thought on stage. That even if they all died for their ideals, it'd be worth it. But when I look at you...

#### （3）恐怖分子

V："Terrorist and Raging Asshole."

强尼：Harsh. But if I saw a headstone like that, I'd wanna meet the guy.

V：Didn't mean that as a compliment.

强尼：I know. 

#### （4）救了我的人

V："The Guy who Saved My Life."

强尼：V... You don't know how much I want that to be true.

——————

强尼：Listen, I realize I fucked up a lotta things. Either let down or used every last person who gave me their trust. Blind, selfish bastard that I was. But I've managed one thing for now. Not to fuck this up, what we have.（听着，我知道我把很多事都搞得稀巴烂。要么让朋友们失望，要么耗尽他们的信任。以前我就是个自私的人渣，但现在不会了。我不想搞臭你我之间的关系，来之不易。）

（1）

V：Been a long, bumpy road, but we made it.

（2）

V：No, Johnny. You fucked that up, too. You used me, lied to me... Can't trust you at all.

强尼：Ahem, is it too late to ask for a second chance?

（2.1）

V：Too late. This was your second chance. You died, came back and still had no idea what to do with it all.

强尼：Think you're right.

（2.2）

V：What d'you want from me?

（3）

V：No need to confess all your wrongs to me, Johnny.

强尼：I know. But maybe I want to.

——————

强尼：Most people I thought were my friends, they couldn't even stand to be in the same room with. You're fuckin' closest to me by a long shot. There twenty-four seven. And yet... you don't seem to hate my living guts.（我把某些人当朋友看，但他们连跟我待在同一间屋子里都受不了。你离我这么近，7*24小时形影不离。但……你似乎一点也不讨厌我的做派。）

（1）

强尼：At least so it seemed... till now.

(1.1)

V：OK. But as second chances go, this is your last. I refuse to be that naive.

强尼：I'll try damned hard.

（1.2）

V：Don't hate you... just had enough. Look at you - still trying to manipulate me.

强尼：Shit. I really fucked up.

（2.1）

V：You were a real dickwipe at first.

强尼：You sorta deserved it. Remember wakin' up at Viktor's, not knowin' about me? "I'm seeing things, I'm scared." Then moanin' at Misty's 'bout how you didn't wanna die?

V：Remeber you whinin' for smokes in the middle of the night, complainin' about not bein' able to kill me.

强尼：Never thought we'd make it this far.

（2.2）

V：Too bad we didn't talk like this earlier. Wouda made things easier.

强尼：Never found the right moment.

——————

（1）

V：When you said you let your friends down, did you mean Rogue?

强尼：Rogue, Alt, Kerry, Santiago.

（后接罗格支线）

（2）

V：Still feel like you can't breathe in here?

强尼：Nah. Not sayin' it's great, but it's different.

强尼：Sometimes when I wake up, feels like I'm back for a while. Like I got this body to myself. Like I'm free. Seconds later, feels like I'm missing something - something really important. Then I realize you're there, always were, and this stupid wave of relief washes over me. （有时候我醒过来，会觉得自己回来很久了。就像这身体本来就是我的，我是自由的。短短几秒后， 我就会觉得好像丢了什么——某些非常重要的东西。然后我会意识到你还在，一直都在。于是一种巨大到愚蠢的放松感就会淹没我。）

V：Have similar dreams sometimes. That you never died, that I'm you. Not like I think, "What would Johnny do?" It's more I do something and I feel... fuckin' great. Like I've finally started to fit into this world.（有时我做过类似的梦。梦里你从没死去，而我就是你。和我在想“强尼会怎么做”的时候不一样。更像是，我做了一件事，然后就觉得……真tm爽。就好像我终于开始融入了这个世界。）

——————

V：Worth comin' out all the same?

强尼：Absolutely. Thanks, V. Of all the heads I coulda popped in, hella glad it was yours.

### 36. 关于死亡（同强尼的对话）

（从赫尔曼地方出来）

V：Fuck...!

强尼：That was your ticker. Sit and rest. Don't need you flatlinin' while we got a job to do.

V：Blah blah blah, fuck Arasaka, blah blah, smash Mikoshi.

强尼：You really are turnin' into me.

V：Ugh. Might be right.

强尼：We're bickering like a shriveled old married couple. It's time we let up, let a little trust take hold.

V：You can be a charming guy - just make the effort, charisma flows. Then I remember that nuke you detonated downtown without a second thought and no hint of later remorse. 

强尼：It was Mikoshi I was after, wanted to destroy it. Gave 'Sake ample time to clear the building.

V：You knew countless people would die. Don't kid yourself.

强尼：Take lives aplenty yourself. See scale as a problem?

V：Whatever, won't argue. All I'm sayin' is you're unpredictable.

强尼：You pot, me kettle. Remeber where you used to be, then think what you've done lately. Path clear, see where you're goin'?

V：Got no idea where I'm goin'... Be a living legend - that's all I wanted. Feels like I'm barely survivin'.

强尼：Test of a person's true value? Death - facing it, staring it down. You still got a chance to be somebody.

V：Yeah... maybe. What was it like? When you died?

强尼：Was on top of the world. Failure - not an option, not a thought... till it happened. Death feels real now, it's only now I know it.

V：Now? Had half a century to come to terms.

强尼：Mikoshi felt... I dunno, like sleep? Lacked awarenenss, had no sense of passing time, didn't mark it.

强尼：Did what they wanted to me. I just remember... cold, a black void, fear. Or -- or was that *your* death?

V：Well, think I got why you detest the place.

强尼：Shouldn't exist. Of all the destruction and pain corps wreak 'round the world, what happens at Mikoshi is worst. Know why?

V：Eternity - it lasts forever. / You're denied the right to die. / **They can change you into somebody else.** / They experiment on the human psyche.

强尼：Yep... Goddamn right. Worst thing's when they switch up your identity and you never even know you've become someone else.

强尼：Corps've already taken the world for their own, now they're comin' for us.

V：Realize what you're doin' to me is what Arasaka's doin' at Mikoshi?

强尼：Yeah, I know... That's why I'm gonna fix it.

### 37. 壁龛前路人的对话

（来自巴里的支线任务“当你凝视深渊时”）

父亲：因为妈妈病得很重，不得不离开。但我知道她一直在天上看着你，她非常爱你。

孩子：普勒斯顿说他爸爸死了，但他还是能看见，也能随时和他说话。

父亲：因为普勒斯顿的爸爸……他没有和你妈妈一样去天堂。

孩子：普勒斯顿说他爸爸在荒坂，那里比天堂更好。他还说，如果我们有钱，妈妈也能去荒坂，就不用去天堂了。这样的话我们就能每天去看她了。

父亲：亲爱的，我很抱歉……

### 38. 蜘蛛墨菲的日记

（来自“魔法书”支线）

2021年05月07日

巴特莫斯错了。所有人都错了。

网络只是一面镜子，反应了我们的思维和梦想，我们的生活。巴特莫斯把它摔成碎片，以为这样就够了。可就算是这样，你依然能在每块碎片中看到自己的倒影。如今一面镜子被打碎，却多出了几千面。

现在每个公司、政府和帮派都有了自己的网络，他们不受任何约束，用铁腕统治着那里。监控没有消失。在那些支配我们的人手里，它变得更加恶劣。他们就像当代的命运女神，把我们人生的光缆缠在自己义体做的手指上，随时准备临时通知我们之后把它一刀剪断。他们听见了我们的沮丧，看着我们徒劳的反抗，发出捧腹的大笑，就连整个世界的核心都为之震颤。

### 39. 摇滚小子

（来自：[VG百科](https://www.vgbaike.com/cyberpunk_2077/baike1582?wid=932)）

他们是一群21世纪的叛逆者，用音乐做武器，矛头直指公司和当权阶级。他们是桀骜不驯的艺术家，街头英雄，魅力超凡的领衔人物，在往往以暴乱收场的演唱会上，让成千上万的粉丝为之疯狂。绝不妥协的态度、激进政治色彩的歌词和表演为他们赢得了属于自己的社会地位。

如果言语和音乐还不足以把观点传达出去，那么他们扣下扳机的手指也会变得和弹奏吉他的时候一样灵巧。强尼，银手为摇滚小子设立了标杆，在他神秘死亡五十年后，这一点也未曾有多少改变。摇滚小子们依然声嘶力竭地抨击着体制带来的压迫。不过也有像克里·欧罗迪恩这样的人，人们指责他为了金钱和名誉无耻地出卖灵魂，抛弃了朋克摇滚的叛逆精神。

就算这是真的，世界依然需要音乐界的革命者，而他们就在我们中间。也许他们才刚刚开始谱写自己的第一首《操你妈》,也许他们即将踉踉跄跄地从脏乱的酒吧里走出来，向公司和警察宣战——但当他们最终发声的时候，人们一定会听见。

——《赛博朋克2077》游戏内数据库

叛逆的摇滚乐手，利用表演和言辞来反抗权威。

摇滚小子就是21世纪的吟游诗人，是社会的良知与反叛者。随着数字音乐工作室和激光母盘车库工作间的出现，每个摇滚小子都可以随时将一条消息带到街头或者把它藏在唱片店里，以避开通讯卫星的监控。

有时候，这个消息是企业寡头或政府不想听到的。有时候你谈论的是管理着这个世界的权势高人的真实面孔。但你不在乎，作为一个摇滚小子，你知道这里就是你挑战权威的地方。无论是创作直白的抗议歌曲，彰显自己，或者只是通过玩摇滚乐呼吁人们远离电视机加入抗争，你作为一个摇滚小子，有着令人骄傲的历史——Dylan，Springsteen，Who，Elvis，The Stones——用尖锐的吉他音阶和直言不讳的歌词传述真相的硬汉英雄军团。

摇滚小子有能力激励和告知群众，接受其领导。摇滚小子的一首歌曲可以给予胆怯者勇气、给予懦弱者力量、给予盲目者光明。摇滚小子的传说导致了军队反过头对抗巨型企业，摇滚小子的歌曲暴露了独裁者的腐败并扼杀了他们。对于每天晚上都辗转在某个城市演出的人来说，这是一种强大的能力，但是摇滚小子绝对可以掌握它。毕竟，摇滚小子就是来体验这一切的。

### 41.【米丝蒂】山丘上的愚者

世界本就是幻境的迷宫。想让光芒照进俗世的牢笼，本来就不容易。

塔罗牌预示的是一条道路——那就沿着它走下去。……仔细思考你看到的东西。要我看，它们就是上天派来帮你寻找真理的。

等你选择要走哪条路的时候，一定会觉得很困难。那时你就明白了。

审判：一种可能的未来。救赎、转变、觉醒。吹号角的天使代表一个时代的结束——呼唤重生、呼唤新的开始。

恶魔：它代表原始、不可抗拒的渴望，但也有生存的意志。它还代表虚假的世界——是这些欲望为你设下的陷阱。

愚者：流浪的愚人，就是你和银手。你们共同走过了很长一段路，发现了自己的潜能。

\- V：我们要去哪儿？

你们的目标是世界，最后一张牌。你们都曾向世界宣战，因此有两种可能——胜利或者讲和。

\- V：还有可能打输呢。

### 42. 日志里的塔罗牌解释

- 愚人：所有人都是愚人，包括你我。旅程中的每一步，对他来说都像是迈向勇敢新世界的第一步。最终，这段旅程将会改变他。但正如卡牌所表现的，他是个可靠的家伙，心中充满无穷的希望，将他引向自己的目标。
- 魔术师：魔术师代表自己，运用头脑与纯粹的意志适应任何情况。魔术师是老谋深算的，永远会留一手，哪怕其他一切都不断变幻，也能把握自己的命运。
- 女祭司：女祭司是一张神秘的卡牌。它代表我们的秘密挂在悬丝上，不断在常识与本能中挣扎。女祭司象征着冰冷平静的水面，和深深隐藏在水面下的秘密。
- 女皇：女皇是女性与母亲的卡牌。她充满决断，清楚自己想要什么，精致而敏感。女皇象征创造力与成长，让我们不要忽略无意中的冲动，而是要相信自己的直觉。
- 皇帝：皇帝代表族长的控制，以及对操控未来的权威与力量的热爱。皇帝为公共利益制定规则并加以执行，但特权也有黑暗的一面。皇帝霸道无情，为了达到自己的目的，不惜让尸体堆积如山。
- 教皇：教皇象征对传统的尊重。它代表着那些想要维护既有秩序，乃至于自身个性都为之改变的人。教皇对体制坚信不疑，因为它的另一面是纯粹的混乱。只有信奉秩序，他才能获得力量。
- 恋人：恋人是二元化的一张卡牌。它揭示了我们内心的矛盾和在两个极端之间维持平衡的挑战。恋人也是进退维谷的卡牌，就像站在十字路口的愚人，迟迟无法做出决定。
- 战车：战车总会冲向前方，哪怕马儿想把它拉向不同的方向。车夫时刻拉紧缰绳，在理智的帮助下控制着灵魂的光明面与黑暗面。骑上战车，必将经历高潮和低谷，有起就有落。
- 力量：力量是象征意志力的卡牌。它与决心、勇气与内心挣扎相关。一个人必须决心坚定，才能跨越障碍，实现目标。力量代表身体的强壮与精神的顽强，为了让不可能成为可能，必须释放这种力量。
- 隐士：隐士是代表自我隔离的卡牌。它象征着逃离城市的喧嚣，从日日向新的忙碌转入古老的生活方式。对隐士来说，孤独是通往飞升的道路，要走到终点，不能靠大步飞跃，只能靠缓慢而专注的步伐。
- 命运之轮：命运之轮意味着变化的到来。命运将会出现转折，无论好坏，但一定会带来新的可能。巨轮提醒我们，没有谁会一直占据上风，也没有什么时刻会是纯粹的绝望。
- 正义：正义是解决争端的卡牌。它呼唤秩序，希望看透谎言与欺骗，让一切回归自然状态。正义暗示着公正的宣判，但也有应尽的程序。
- 倒吊人：倒吊人是牺牲的卡牌，意味着要获得启迪，必须付出代价。倒吊人的牺牲打开了重获新生的道路，但这条路遍布被时光封存的痛苦，最终将通向死神。
- 死神：死神是变化的卡牌。它象征着迫在眉睫的剧变：生命的一个阶段即将结束，另一个即将开始。在这个变化中，难免会失去一些东西，但也会被其他东西取代。
- 节制：节制是平衡的卡牌。它可以象征自我控制，或是向更成熟的均衡状态逐渐演变。节制与自我控制，以及达到内心平静的渴望相关。
- 高塔：高塔预示着剧变、混乱与毁灭。闪电劈中高塔，代表埋在废墟下的旧秩序即将返回，并从中诞生新的秩序。它象征着悲剧、最终审判和自我毁灭。
- 星星：星星是希望的卡牌。在最黑暗的深夜，仍有一丝通往家园的光明。星星是启迪，是动力，给我们不断向前的力量。
- 月亮：月亮提醒我们，现实往往与第一眼看上去的并不一样。在充满外表幻象的世界中，跟着自己的直觉走往往是最好的选择。月亮也象征梦想、欲望，当然还有沉睡，死神的夜之仪式。
- 太阳：太阳是成功的象征，是代表自由、复兴与光明未来的卡牌。太阳也标志着真理，因为阳光总会照亮隐瞒世间秘密的黑暗。它也是伟大与荣耀的象征。
- 世界：世界是愚人漫长曲折的旅程的终点。与最初相比，愚人变得更加睿智老练，迎来了决定的时刻。有些人会接受旅程将我们引到的地方，其他人则将拥抱新的挑战。在这个世界中，有一件事很确定：你无法拥有一切。

### 43. 各种结局处奥特的诗

#### （1）帕南线、solo线

那么我们走吧，你我两个人，
正当朝天空慢慢铺展着黄昏，
好似病人麻醉在手术桌上，
我们走吧，穿过一些半清冷的街，
那里正人声喋喋，
有夜夜不宁的下等歇夜旅店
和满地蚌壳的铺锯末的饭馆，
街连着街，好像一场讨厌的争议
带着阴险的意图
要把你引向一个重大的问题……
唉，不要问，‘那是什么？’
让我们快点去做客。

——《普鲁弗洛克的情歌》T. S. 艾略特；查良铮 译 

#### （2）罗格线

若我超脱自然，便将绝不在用
任何自然物化作身躯之外形，
而只求古希腊金匠人用鎏金
和镀金锤铸的绝美造型，
以使昏昏欲睡的帝王清醒；
或停留在金色枝头声声歌唱，
把过往，今日，或明朝之事
唱给拜占庭的贵妇王公们听。

——《驶向拜占庭》叶芝；傅浩 译

### 44. 强尼写的日志（Journal Entry）

#### （1）主线

##### Playing for time

Don't trust that Takemura. Meet with him, sure, check him out, but keep your eyes open. He's a corporat, meaning he's looking to use you.

##### Automatic Love

So you've decided to find the chick who put on this first-class shitshow. She had a job and you took it 'cause there was no one else to knock some sense into your gonk head. I'm here now, but so what? This search and rescue bullshit's a dead end, but that's not about to stop you. Maybe Evelyn will, who knows? Sure seems like she doesn't wanna be found. 

##### The Space in Between

If I've learned one thing from joyhouses, it's to quit while the going's good. Stare at those fake smiles too long, and all you'll see is misery. As far as clubs go they're all pretty pathetic, but at least it's in their own way. You know the chances of finding Evelyn are close to zilch, right? Like that's gonna change your mind... Anyway, let's go pay a visit to this so-called Fingers. But if we don't find Parker, you owe me a drink.

##### Disasterpiece

Every city's got its shady neighborhoods and "no-go" zones. Stepping into these areas in Night City is like wading into the abyss and feeling it stare back through your soul. Anyone with an ounce of sense avoids these haunts altogether. Your average gonk's usually seen limping out, bleeding from one or more places. And you, V? Just make sure you come out intact.

##### Double Life

There's nothing you can't take away from a person - you just gotta look hard enough. When all options are exhausted, you've still got a body that can be harvested, skills that can be put to good use... Oh, and let's not forget "dignity" - that's a classic. Hell, I'm starting to think I could've done worse than end up on this little Relic of yours.

##### M'ap Tann Pèlen

Well, we know the Voodoo Boys were behind all this, so that's one step forward. Problem is, now we have to reach them somehow - two steps back. There are a lot of things to be found in Pacifica, just usually not what you're looking for. Good news is you already got your fixer: a man without a face to help you find this fart in the wind. Sounds like a fun fuckin' delight.

##### I Walk the Line

I'm sick of this Placide motherfucker as much as you, but at least the fog has lifted, the goal is clear. You find a netrunner in the GIM and the Voodoo goons will set up a meet-n-greet with their queen. Pros? Maybe I'll actually get to see a legit netrunner, 'cause it's sure starting to feel like an extinct species these days. Someone who's got the guts to square off against the Voodoos has given me some hope, at least. But the cons? Damn near any minute your brain could start dripping out your ears. Afraid we won't have time to make pilgrimmages to the monuments of Pacifica's Golden Age.

##### Never Fade Away

You get nightmares, don't you V? The stubborn kind that keep coming back, night after night, like they wanna make sure you never forget a single detail, sight or touch? The kind where you can barely breathe because you know what comes next?

You ever get those? I know you do. So here - welcome to mine.

##### Ghost Town

Wanna track down Hellman? Start at the Afterlife. Sure, the place has changed over the years, but one thing never will: you got a question you just can't shake, head to The Afterlife. Always someone there to whisper the answer in your ear... for the right price. And if that someone's Rogue – shit, I wouldn't miss this meet for the world.

Just when you think you've solved your problem, your solution goes and starts making fucking demands. Looks like Panam'll only scratch your back if you scratch hers. Could've expected that, coming from a nomad. Know what, though? I've got a good feeling about this sand-swept desert dame. Let's see where our newfound friendship takes us. Preferably to that weasely fuck, Hellman.

##### Lightning Breaks

Panam Palmer. Gotta say, I like her. Girl's got a pair - and clearly a plan, too. Let's see if it's enough to grab Hellman. Honestly, V, never thought I'd ride with the nomads again. I know, I know she left the Aldecaldos, but you can feel it too, can't you? Clan's in her blood and bones. In her heart. Don't think she'll let us down.

##### Down on the Street

If someone told me I'd be taking calls from Saburo Arasaka's fucking bodyguard, I'd have laughed in their face. And now we're supposed to meet with some Takemura? Hand over all our detes? I'm not even gonna pretend like this is a good idea. But fuck it - sometimes you just gotta go all in.

##### Gimme Danger

Our crazed ronin shows no signs of slowing his roll. We barely get intel from Wakako about the parade and Takemura's already hatching some hairbraned scheme in Japantown. He wants to meet at the market? Fine, let's parley, but you already know where I stand. Don't let him strong-arm you into anything. Who knows how many loose screws are bouncing around that skull at this points...

##### Play It Safe

Since I wasn't invited to Saburo Arasaka's funeral, I guess this sad little parade will have to do - I'm just missing confetti. But in all seriousness, Takemura must have a death wish. He's just gonna jump onto Hanako's platform? Be my fucking guest - we'll deal with the snipers. Meanwhile, keep an eye out for an escape route. This gonna go all kinds of wrong - I can feel it.

##### Search and Destroy

Know what my downside is? No matter how much I might want to, I don't fucking make mistakes. Lo and behold! Our factory-reset ronin, hounded by every single Arasaka soldier in Night City for KIDNAPPING Saburo Arasaka's daughter. Kudos to him - I couldn't've fucked this plan up better myself. And after all this he STILL wants you to drop by? I don't know who's more whacked - him or us. Just remember to knock four times. His head, preferably - against a fucking table.

#### （2）结局

##### Nocturne Op55N1

We both knew this time would come. If we don't think of something quick, you will die - and I'll go with you. It's time for our final meeting.

##### 恶魔结局

###### Last Caress

That's all, folks! Little Johnny can go to sleep while the grown-ups fix their big ol' mess. All I know's that you cut a deal with Arasaka - you help Hanako knock Yorinobu off his pedestal in return for help with the Relic. You already know where I stand. You've got better things to dream about than a rockerboy's mad ravings. Just make sure this little dream of yours doesn't turn into a nightmare.

###### Totalimmortal

Go to hell, V. You're on your own, got that? Stage is all yours. I'll just stand in the wings and watch you meet certain death, 'cause that's how this little coup against Yorinobu is gonna end. That is, unless our porcelain doll's got any aces up her sleeve. But if things go south, just jump out the window. Don't give them the satisfaction - don't let the fuckers take you alive.

Well I'll be a corporat on a stick. Yorinobu tried to take out the entire Arasaka board in one fell swoop. I'd buy the gonk a beer if I could. No doubt, the sight of Arasakas lunging at each other's throat is a thing of beauty, but it kinda throws a wrench in our plans. Now you gotta take care of Yorinobu on Hanako's terms. Looks like Lil Sis is done playing around - crazy Big Bro's gonna give up Arasaka tower one way or the other. Still, isn't it weird that we're not allowed to hurt a hair on his pretty little head after he marked her for DEATH? Maybe Hanako wants to "neutralize" him herself? One thing's for sure - the path to Yorinobu's office leads through a lot of levels... and a LOT of bodies.

##### 星星结局

###### We Gotta Live Together

I was gonna say that this time you'd have to go it alone, but it looks like the Aldecaldos've got some fight in them after all. Wonder what you see in them: a partner? Friend? Family? Something tells me sooner or later you're gonna have to choose one of the above, especially if it's thanks to them you get into Mikoshi.

###### Forward to Death

Last stop on the line. Little does the corp know that this train's not going back. It's a shame I won't be there with you, 'cuz it's looking to be one helluva ride. But hey, that's what family's for, right? Anyway, once you get to the Arasaka sublevels, that crater filled with chrome and concrete, just take a second to remember that Johnny was there. Then mow down anyone in your way and get to Mikoshi.

###### Belly of the Beast

You're almost there, V. In the heart of fucking darkness. Can you feel it? You're so close to the moment of goddamn truth. And I'm right there with you. Still. Always. Even if I'm just a blacked-out passenger in the backseat. Whatever you do, do it for us. At the very least, that's what I'm fucking counting on.

###### All Along the Watchtower

So you decided to ditch the City of Dreams - start anew, start fresh. I went through a few fresh starts in my life, too. And you know what? Don't regret a damn thing. You won't either. Give my regards to the South. And when you hear Johnny's voice, go ahead and smile, but don't bother to answer. It'll just be a voice on the radio recorded long ago, a fading reproduction, a flickering memory. You'll be someone completely different. Take care, V.

##### 节制结局

###### New Dawn Fades

Every story has its end. And let me tell you V, I never thought yours would mean anything but mine, too. But... here I am. Still alive and still kicking. For the first time in fifty long, long years.

If you're out there somewhere - and I think you are - take a look at me now.

牺牲。这个字眼完全不足以形容发生在神舆里的事。然而为了一个罪有应得的人而献出自己的生命，你又该怎么去形容？事实真相是：这副身体如今有了新主人，要是这人敢有一点对不起它，那他就该直接下地狱。你都听见了吗，V？妈的，不知怎么，我总觉得你并没有离我而去……

#### （3）支线任务

##### 黑拳

###### Beat on the Brat: The Glen

Time for another rumble - this time in the Glen. I'd put money on their champ being a Valentino. Yeah, I can see him now: two golden fists and a machete across his back... y'know, in case things get dicey and take a turn for the unsportsmanlike.

###### Beat on the Brat: Pacifica

A throwdown in Pacifica, huh? Wonder who you're up again. I'd say a Haitian, though I guess that much is probably obvious. Careful, those Pacificans don't fight for first blood - they fight for last blood.

###### Beat on the Brat: Arroyo

Heard somewhere the champ of Arroyo is a grade-A prick. Good news - should make beatin' his ass all the more fun.

###### Beat on the Brat: Rancho Coronado

A fight in an Animals' club? Oof... feel sorry for you, I do. These guys play hard, V. It won't be easy... and it won't be fun.

###### Beat on the Brat: Kabuki

Don't overthink this one. You have to defeat the champion of Kabuki. You know the stakes, you know the place. Now get your ass over there and win.

###### Beat on the Brat

You're gettin' noticed, V. People can sense that hunger in you - one that can't be satiated. You want everything right now, and if you don't it...  you fight for it. You're a warrior, V. And the warrior's place is in the ring. Show 'em what you're made of. Knock the bolts off this training bot. And then, well... we'll see.

##### 赛车

###### The Beast in Me: Badlands

So, you're waiting for a date with Claire and her turbo-charged pet, Beast, away from all the city's hustle and bustle. I wonder how many bodies have been left to the bake in the Badlands sun after these races? Just do a me a favor and don't become one. Watch out for tumbleweeds, bumpy patches... armored Wraith trucks... Y'know, the usual.

###### The Beast in Me: City Center

It's time to find out what really revs Claire's engine, huh? First face of the circuit takes you through the heart of Night City. Back in my time, people who won races like this could count on free drinks for a lifetime. So, y'know... not real long. But still.

###### The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo

Ah, Santo Domingo! The eternal fountain of shit where the only sure thing was you'd eventually step on the toes of some hot-blooded jarhead with "6th Street" tatooed on his ass. You win this race, V, you show them who's in charge around here. You got a good shot too - I don't see this Claire slowing down until she reaches the finals.

###### The Beast in Me: The Big Race

What now, V? Gonna help Claire stick it to the corpos who offed her husband? Or are you just hunting for that top spot on the podium? You know what I'd do if it were my call, but it's your hands on the wheel, not mine. You know... Claire's not so bad, after all. Kinda feel sorry for her actually. But like I said - your call. Good luck out there, turbo.

###### The Beast In Me

No one in Night City is only one layer deep. Take Claire for example - an Afterlife bartender who likes to burn rubber in illegal street races when she's on break. If you get the itch for a little adrenaline, I think you can snatch it at her garage.

##### 德拉曼找车

###### Epistrophy: Badlands

Over the mountains, through the woods, nestled on the hills beyond North Oak - that's where your pal Delamain lost one of his cabs. He's a goddamn talking car himself and, apparently, has more cars of his own. I dunno, but I just say we continue this little fairy tale, find that cab, save the princess and claim half the kingdom.

###### Epistrophy: The Glen

Ahh, the Glen. You know this used to be a college campus? Some thought that taking out colossal loans and enrolling in a biotech degree would make their lives better. Then the harsh reality kicked in - it was easier to throw yourself off a bridge than get into a corporate research lab. Makes you wonder why our rogue Delamain cab chose this place of all places.

###### Epistrophy: Wellsprings

Head to Wellsprings to find one of Delamain's missing vehicles. Or go save yourself from impending death. Up to you.

###### Epistrophy: Coastview

Ever been to Coastview? Not too shabby. Had an output from there once. Sure, maybe she liked to wheeze, jab, pop and snort a little too much, but who wasn't in those days? Her name was Amanda or Amelie or something, I don't remember. Remind me to tell you the shooting range story sometime.

###### Epistrophy: Rancho Coronado

Never been a fan of Rancho Coronado, personally. If you really gotta find a cab out there, just do it quick and get back into the city, OK?

###### Epistrophy: Northside

I kinda like this Delamain. He's comfortable in his own code, not ashamed to be a talking car. He's asked you to find one of his rides in Northside, so I say we do him a favor.

###### Epistrophy: North Oak

A taxi in distress calls for a hero like you, V. If you want to become a legend, set out on this quest for ultimate glory. The Afterlife awaits!

###### Epistrophy

Cars didn't talk back in my day, and now this one wants to give you a job? What a time to be alive... What're you waiting for?

##### Badlands

###### Following the River

The Peter Pan case is done and closed, so you do know you never have to see this badge again... right? OK, fine, I get it, you crawled through shit and fire together, and now you wanna kick back and celebrate your victory. But a family dinner? Fuckin' seriously? Can't just find a decent dive to grab a tequila or ten? Smash the bottle over some corpocunt's face? You're getting soft, V.

###### I'll Fly Away

Something about corpses draws you to their unfinished biz, V. First, it was me... now Scorpion. Mitch wants you to fulfill his final request. Gotta admit it's got my curiosity piqued, but hey, as a dead guy, I'm biased.

###### KOLD MIRAGE

Always somethin' interesting to be found at the dump. Take a half-dead, half-brain merc with an experimental chip in their head for example. Or, in this case, a freezer from 2020... a glimpse into the past.

###### Meetings Along The Edge

Ok, this Zen master guy of yours is literally everywhere. He's gonna fall ass first out of your fridge tomorrow. This meditation's doing the trick for you? Listen, if it's the whole poetic aspect of it, I understand. But in that case just throw on one of my albums, dig into the lyrics, and leave this scam artist out of it.

###### Pyramid Song

Everyone knows you can't just count on yourself in this goddamn city. You always gotta have a few chooms who owe you a favor. And a few you've got dirt on too. But when you've got the kind of choom who starts asking you for weirder and weirder shit? That's when problems start.

###### Riders on the Storm

OK, this must actually be pretty serious. Tough chick like Panam wouldn't call you up for some chump chore. Must be something important. Wouldn't waste any time on this one if I were you. To the Aldecaldos' camp we go.

###### These Boots Are Made for Walkin'

Here you thought your old ride was totaled for good - yet here you are now. Like a phoenix from the ashes, it lives again. But how? Why now? You'd already closed that chapter of kickin' up sand with nomads out in the desert... But I mean, it'd be stupid if you didn't check it out... right? You never can underestimate the past. Because it sure as shit likes to take revenge.

###### With a Little Help from My Friends

The great nomad saga continues: Panam's up to something. That girl just doesn't know when to quit - and my God, I love her for it. You don't seem to know either, considering you wanna go back out there. Maybe you could save us all some time, pitch a tent out in the desert? Think we both know this isn't just about the job anymore.

##### City Center

###### Boat Drinks

The marina, huh? Wonder what Kerry's got up his sleeve this time. Maybe he wants to get rid of someone - toss their body parts in the bay. Or maybe he just wants an audience while he waxes poetic about yachts over shrimp cocktails. Oh well, he's your problem now. Not mine.

###### Bullets

Looks like there's some justice in the world after all. My little merc wants to play dress-up like a corpo, then all the sudden a cyberpsycho kicks down the shop's door. Coincidence? Sure, probably, but a fuckin' delightful one. I hope you learn a valuable lesson today. That is, if you survive 'til the end of it.

###### Imagine

In Night City, there's no shortage of gonks, hustlers and just plain assholes. And if you stopped to talk to each one, you might just cross the last of your wires, too. But if that's what your gut's tellin' you to do, by all means. Just watch for sticky fingers.

##### Heywood

###### Don't Lose Your Mind

Your buddy Delamain appears to be having some personal issues. How else do you explain his cabs standing in the middle of the road and blocking traffic? better give him a call. Besides, you're short on friends (present imaginary company excluded).

###### Heroes

I don't usually give advice, but... fuck it, here goes. Don't make the same mistake I made - say goodbye to the people you love. You know what I mean, right? Jackie Welles was your best choom, and you don't find a lot of straight-up peeps like that in NC. Best thing you can is remember them. Oh, and one more thing. If anyone asks, I didn't just say all that to you. Got it?

###### I Fought the Law

Initial entry:
Look, if a job starts like a classic whodunit - some femme fatale calls you up, refuses to give deets and just calls a meet - one of three things is going down: you're dreaming, you're scrollin' a shit BD or someone's hazing you good. Think you can scratch the first two.

Later entry:
First rule of "top secret" jobs - don't take 'em.
First rule of working with politicians - don't do it.
First rule of contacting the police - avoid it.
And what do you do? Break 'em all at once. Gotta say, V, I'm a little impressed.

###### Only Pain

"To serve and protect..." Funny, would've thought "To extort and torture" might fit better. Not sure what this guy's beef is with badges, but if you don't step in, they'll be scrapin' him off the sidewalk. Once they smear him there first, of course. But I dunno... maybe it's for the best? After all, no one's in Night City's dyin' an innocent soul.

###### Raymond Chandler Evening

Usually it's the customers spillin' the ugly personal stories to the bartender, yet there we were, seeing it the other way around. Pepe thinks his wife is cheating on him and he's looking for someone to confirm his worst suspicions. Classic. A cuckold, a beautiful woman, a city shrouded in darkness... Get the feeling I've read this story before.

###### The Hunt

NCPD boy in blue gives you a holler and you come runnin' like an obedient dog? This ain't gonna become a habit is it? Well, whatever - sounds like he's got an errand for you, real personal kind. Least it's better than chasing dead politicians. Just do me a favor - don't get used to it.

Upon completion:
So some depraved maniac's kidnapping boys, and lo and behold, your badge is caught up in the middle of it. Gotta be honest, this doesn't look good. Peter Pan's just another manifestation of this fucked up city - probably already ended those poor brats. But on the off-chance Randy's still alive... If I were you, I'd go save him. Especially if "breaking the law" is involved.

##### Pacifica

###### Love Rollercoaster

And they say Pacificans don't like strangers... These kids must be an exception to the rule. They found themselves a good vantage point and it'd only be better if that got that old roller coaster runnin'. At least, that's what I'd try.

##### Santo Domingo

###### A Day In The Life

Gonna sound like my gramps for a sec, but you know, in my time, being a punk meant something different. People fought against the system whatever way they could, frying the biggest fish they could catch, tearing down palaces brick by brick. Now every random gonk-brain fool thinks they're a hero for flatlining an unarmed normie. This isn't your beef, I get it... But are you sure don't wanna teach those worms a lesson?

###### Ezekiel Saw the Wheel

Here's a joke for you: V walks into a bar... and gets robbed. The end.

Jesus, you and your shit luck. You better figure something out quick or our epic story's about to get cut short in the stupidest way imaginable. Accidental deaths don't jive too well with me. Or with the birth of legends.

###### Gun Music

The Aldecaldos must really be desperate. To come this close to the city, and deal with scavs no less... Risky move. Sounds like they could use a hand.

###### Rebel! Rebel!

Look, I don't know if Kerry's just having a real late-life crisis, or whether his shrink's got him some on some sweet new meds, but I do know one thing: this gon' be good. Just meet with the guy. Won't be bored, I guarantee it. And Kerry needs some help. Always did. I got nothing against it, either. A friend in need is a friend indeed, and I've never been jealous of that second fiddle in my life.

###### Sex On Wheels

Who ever said no to a free car? Not to mention it's a Quadra Turbo Fuckin' R. So quit picking your nose, head down to Rancho Coronado and get behind that wheel.

###### Sinnerman

You're right about one thing - this job from Wakako stinks to high heaven. Besides, you're above doing plain ol' hit jobs. Probably no harm in talking to Bill Jablonsky and seeing what his deal is. But if I were you? I'd take a hard pass.

###### Space Oddity

Every bum in this town dreams someday they'll hit the jackpot on something they dug up in a dumpster and it'll transform their life. A briefcase stuffed with eddies, a shard holding big company secrets, a cuttin' edge implant that'll pawn for a few dozen Gs. Problem is, usually whoever "misplaced" the thing to begin with is still lookin' for it - and they ain't in a good mood. Do these poor street rats a favor and take this case off their hands. Before the previous owner shows up and decides to make target practice out of 'em.

###### Stadium Love

Hey, if you wanna crash that party, I can respect that. Sometimes those parties kick the most ass. Just watch yourself - this ain't your uncle's birthday barbecue. One wrong word, one false step... there could be blood.

###### The Highwayman

There's a still of some young guy in the garage - the heartbreaker type. Emails on the computer are from a certain James - don't have to be a genius to connect the dots. Might be worth looking for our Romeo - especially in Japantown. Got a feeling the still was snapped there. Wouldn't surprise me - kids go on dates there all the time. Shit... it always starts off so cute, doesn't it? Rarely ever ends that way.

Josie hid the Tyger boss's bike somewhere in the city, near the All Foods factory in Maelstrom turf. Said to look for a "ghost horse." All right then... Think of it like a scavenger hunt, though not the kind fixers in Night City usually pay you for.

Josie... Pretty name. Cute girl. Ugly end. This Tyger from the still... better have a word with him, V. Can't let slide what he did to this poor girl.

Another mystery, another missing person in Night City. Used to be the cops would put out a search for people like her. Today, her fate's in your hands.

###### There Is A Light That Never Goes Out

I love these WTF situations. A guy hires you to off some other guy, and then that first guy dies, but then the second guy hires you to go somewhere with him for who the fuck knows what. But hey, it's not like you're short on work. Just don't fuck this one up, OK? I know you wanna know how this all plays out.

##### Watson

###### A Cool Metal Fire

Now, I don't ask you for much, but I gotta zero Smasher myself. That motherfucker thinks he's invincible. Worse, so does Rogue. All these years, Arasaka Tower's been haunting her. Enough's enough. I'm taking control this one time, I'm finding him, I'm wiping Adam Smasher off the face of the earth.

###### Big in Japan

Find the package, and deliver it from A to B. Simple job, huh? But then why not just book some delivery guy? And why not go through a fixer? Something smells off about this one, V.

###### Blistering Love

Can't even remember why Rogue and I were always at each other's throats. All I remember is the good times - and how few of them there were. Now I've got one night to make it up to her. Yeah, a movie date sounds boring, but hell, we never did normal, boring things. Better late than never, right?

###### Both Sides, Now

You ever hear the saying "No good deed goes unpunished"? You hold your hand out to someone, you get bitten. You help a poor soul in need, you get fleeced for all you're worth. Save someone's life? Fill in the blank.

###### Burning Desire

That's the great thing about Night City - no chance you'll ever get bored here. Where else could you have some dude with a smoking crotch jump into your car askin' to hitch a ride? Come on, V, show some sympathy. Get this guy to a ripper before his dick explodes all over your dashboard.

###### Chippin' In

This is it, Rogue's in for the kill - she's ready to stop running from her past and catch Smasher. And when we catch the bastard, I wanna be the one to pull the trigger. But for now - you're in charge. Happy hunting!

###### Every Breath You Take

Blue Moon has a problem. One that a publicist, an agent, or even an entourage can't solve. That's 'cause this is a problem with some actual meat on it, one that calls for somebody with a half-decent brain on their shoulders and some hot iron in their holster. Someone really loves her - or loves to hate her. You gotta find this guy and take him out. For most, an opportunity to help a big-time pop icon like her only happens once in a... well, you get it.

###### Fool on the Hill

Maybe these strange images that you're seein' really do exist. Or maybe the biochip's already turned your brain into scop and salmon casserole. Whatever the case, spotting these symbols in unexpected places feels like a mystery beggin' to be solved. In your shoes, I'd have a word with Viktor of that chakra chick about these. Should interest at least one of 'em.

###### Fortunate Son

Kidney failure. In the city, nothing that a stack of eddies and a few minutes won't solve. But in the Badlands... a death sentence. That is, unless a gentle soul somewhere feels like playin' guardian angel. Someone that'll get him the implant he needs before it's too late. Well, V? Think there 's anyone out there like that?

###### Full Disclosure

Sandra Dorsett... that chick you pulled out of a scavs' nest? Man, give someone an inch and they take a mile... This databank must be pretty special to her if she ain't even willing to go through a fixer. Well, damn... now I'm kinda curious. Gonna help out - or play by the rules of the game?

###### Happy Together

Seems like the PD's taken an interest in a neighbor of yours. Even sounded like they knew each other. Will you assume the mantle of a concerned, responsible citizen and ask what's going on? I mean, if you got a potential psycho for a neighbor, wouldn't you want to know?

###### Human Nature

When a person dies, the world keeps chugging along without skipping a beat. Eventually, all traces of that person fade into nothing. Long story short, that's why your wheels were towed. Want my opinion? The best way to convince the world you're alive and kicking is to get your wheels back. Hell, maybe it's not the most ambitious goal, but for a minor-league merc like you, at least it's a start.

###### Machine Gun

So, what, You're giving Skippy to Regina? Too bad. Not everyday find a gun you can share your deepest and darkest with. And have it reciprocate, that is. On the other hand, I get you... Already got enough voices in your head, amirite?

###### Paid in Full

I don't know many rippers who'd install Kiroshi optics on credit and faith. In fact, I only know one - Viktor. Maybe once you're on top you don't forget about the old guy, yeah? Pay the man what he's due.

###### Psycho Killer

Looks like Regina wants to turn you into a one-woman/man army in the fight against cyberpsychosis. Understandable, seeing as most of our heroic badges seem to vanish from the scene at the mention of "cyberpsycho."

One thing I still don't get - why does she want them alive?

###### Sacrum Profanum

Among the handful of things that really piss me off, I'd say pickin' on the little guy for funsies is pretty high on my list. If I could save this monk and scrap a few tinboy Maelstromers along the way, I'd say sign me up. If you feel the same - and hurry your ass up - maybe you can even still save the guy.

###### Shoot To Thrill

A shooting range competition? Ho-ho, wonder what fun prizes are up for grabs. Giant teddy bear? Inflatable sword? Tiny plastic football? Whatever it is, enjoy yourself, 'cause I'm sittin' this one out. Don't much like it when people treat weapons like toys.

###### Spellbound

A job from Nix? Should be interesting. Guy's got a rep for being an expert on antique tech, pre-Krash hardware. Decks, mag disks, yada yada yada. Some people'll tell you it's all as useful as a typewriter, a record player, a pile of dried cat shit. But me... I wouldn't be so sure about that.

###### Talkin' 'bout a Revolution

There's no such thing as a free lunch, V. If someone invites you to a chow-down, someone's gonna pay. Who knows, maybe the bad guys'll saddle up - answer for all the bad shit they've done. But you know what I think? I think you're the one who's paying. And that check's well on its way.

###### The Prophet's Song

A clandestine meeting of reptilians at midnight? V, we're not missing this. If you want answers to questions plaguing humankind for eons, this might be your only shot. Is there life in the cosmos? Is there anyone pulling the strings? If so, why? And why the fuck do they let all this evil shit happen? And to think the Universe's greatest secrets could be found in some old factory in our humble little Night City...

###### Tune Up

Fender benders are a dime a dozen in Night City. A Delamain though? A first, I'm guessing. But now he wants to hand out compensation for damages? That's just downright suspect. Way I see it, he's got a the AI equivalent of a gun pointed at his head, and this message is nothing but a coded cry for help. Nobody, and I mean nobody, doles out compensation for a little chipped paintwork. Go and see what this is about - worst case you come out a little richer.

###### Venus in Furs

Meredith Stout invited you over to her room at the No-Tell Motel? Shit, V, don't know whether to give you props or talk you out of it... Either way, you're telling me your secret for picking up corpo chicks.

###### Violence

Unknown number, anonymous client, a secret hotel meet-up... The aura of mystery 'round this one's so thick I need a machete to hack my way through it. Wonder what'll happen next... and what that means for you.

##### Westbrook

###### Coin Operated Boy

All right, so I'm feeling like a sucker for this story. Do you really think Brendan is just spitting out the sentences is was programmed for? The stuff some marketing guru thinks customers want to hear? That'd be pretty fucked even by Night City standards. In any case, we won't know until you find him.

###### Dream On

Well, well, special favors for politicians. You think you've got any clout here? The Peralezes might seem like decent and down-to-earth folk - not sitting snug in the corps' pockets like the rest. But they're still part of the ruling elite, V. If they gotta step over you to get to the top, they won't hesitate. Don't believe even for a second that they're any different.

###### Holdin' On

The whole time I was flat on my digital ass in Mikoshi, Kerry was out there forging his glittering solo career. He'd better be real fucking chill after all these years, right? But something tells me deep down, he's still the same. Anyway, come on, guy's gonna shit himself when he sees me.

###### I Can See Clearly Now（TBA）

###### Off the Leash

You know, Kerry's whole escapade makes me think. People do change. He did, I mean - he made it to a crossroads, and now I can see his rockerboy heart pushing him down the right path. The problem, you ask? Kerry might've changed, but the city hasn't. And I think he knows it. Hell, so do you.

###### Pisces

What's worse than a corpo? A wannabe corpo.

You know what? I'm not even surprised you let yourself get talked into this little uprising. Hey, back in my day I would've bum rushed the riot shields in the name of joytoys' freedom or whatever... But this Maiko chick? I've got a bad feeling about her.

###### Poem Of The Atoms

You really enjoy this meditation thing? Calms your nerves, does it? 'Cause it somehow reminds me of those black-tie musicians they stick next to the towels and mouthwash in monochromer joints so you can get taste of culture after you let out a shit. But hey, to each their own.

###### Send in the Clowns

Ozob... Quite the name. Don't know why, but the sound of it gets creepy circus music stuck in my head. Maybe the dude was an acrobat or lion tamer or some shit. Never know in this city. And we won't know till we call him and find out.

###### Spray Paint（TBA）

###### Stairway To Heaven

Look at that, your Zen master has reappeared. Some advertising shtick, no doubt. Thing is, I don't know fuck all about what he's trying to sell you. Stay sharp around characters like him.

###### Sweet Dreams

Everyone knows the most gut-twisting, brain-blitzing, 'dorph-jacking braindances aren't bought in stores or feeders, but on the streets, outside normal circulation. Take our fine man Stefan, here, as proof. Seems he's got the rawest BDs in the city - not for the faint of heart. Whaddaya say? Wanna take that rush to the next level?

###### **The Ballad of Buck Ravers**

Don't think I've gone all sentimental or anything. Honestly, I couldn't give a shit if I've got any fans left in this city. If someone hears one of my tracks and they get the itch to take to the streets, then that's fucking nova, but those old recordings don't matter anymore. Find 'em, listen to 'em, I don't care. Although while we're on the subject... Wonder how thing are over at Rainbow Cadenza...

###### The Gig

Whenever we go see Wakako and walk into that pachinko salon of hers, I get this weird, like, tingling feeling on the back of my neck. I dunno, V, she's all knots of weird. Anyway, she promised a special reward for this job with Sandra Dorsett. All we have to do is go see her on Jig-Jig Street.

###### They Won't Go When I Go

Well, whaddaya know. This corpo-slut from the crucifixion BD wants you to come back to give her star a pep talk, massage his fucking shoulders and whatnot. Normally I'd tell you to drop it, find something more fun to do, but... I dunno, seems like this Jesus freak could really use your help.

#### （4）委托

##### 赛博精神病

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Bloody Ritual

Not everyone's made for Maelstrom. Some - surprise, surprise - don't take to well to having half their face chopped off. They start hearing voices, seeing and imagining things. Then, it's enough to get their hands on a gun, and... that recipe for disaster's ready to serve.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Demons of War

Usually, when a corpo gets his walking papers, he loses all his implants too. They dig those synth organs and cyber eyes right out of his body. But sometimes, the chrome's so far ingrown, it can't be removed safely. Even if someone really, really wants it...

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Discount Doc

Working on a construction site has its perks: breeze on your face, sun on your shoulders, no creepy corpo smell and tangible results you can show off to the world. It's good, honest work. 'Course Night City's always got a way of fucking things up.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: House on a Hill

Shots were heard on the outskirts of NC - rare given the seemingly peaceful area. We oughta go and take a closer look. Why wait for the clean-up crew when there could still be lives that need saving?

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Letter of the Law

I have a bad feeling about this. A real bad feeling.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Lex Talionis

The underpass near GIM is like NC's Bermuda Triangle for the homeless. Sound like a piece of cake? In the heart of Pacifica, nothing ever is.

Enter at your own risk.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Lt. Mower

WARNING! CYBERPSYCHO DETECTED. MILITECH HAS LOCKED DOWN THE AREA. KEEP AWAY!

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: On Deaf Ears

Hey V! Watch out. Whoever left those bodies is still hanging around.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Phantom of Night City

Ghosts? Ghosts don't exist, V. The dead can tell you that.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Seaside Cafe

Whoever killed them was packing a lot of hate, a lot of rage. And those feelings don't fade quickly. Be careful.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Second Chances

Everyone deserves a second chance, V. I know that better than most. But who's granting that chance and who's getting it are important questions that oughta be asked.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Six Feet Under

Maelstrom certainly has its own unique recruitment and retention methods. Ranks getting too thin? Well, just kidnap a few Valentinos, knock 'em out cold and bolt on some new faceplates. What could possibly go wrong with that? everything, that's what.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Smoke on the Water

If it weren't for the all the screaming, dead Scavs and that wreck of a car, be a pretty nice place. But hey, that's life. Wanna go check it out, see what went down? Try the pier first.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: The Wasteland

Does a cyclone of dust and sand stirred up by a dash cyberpsychosis sound exciting? Then I do I have some good news for you.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Ticket to the Major Leagues

Not all people cope the same way when those first symptoms of cyberpsychosis show up. Some throw themselves off a bridge. Others hand themselves over to the cops. And most of the rest try to self-treat with sedatives - as many as they can get their hands on. No matter the cost.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Under the Bridge

V, you don't have anywhere else to be? Only thing you'll stir up here is trouble. I'd beat it, but... you do you.

###### Cyberpsycho Sighting: Where the Bodies Hit the Floor

There are few certainties in Night City... Super-sketch stomach-melting streetfood, politicians choked by corporate leashes and the echo of screams heard coming from the Totentanz club. Oh wait, and one more thing: if you step foot down the wrong alley, your head will probably roll out the other end.

##### 其他

###### Gig: Goodbye, Night City

Sometimes you need a friend to lean on. Sometimes you need a friend to break you out of an immigrant detention center at the Night City-SoCal border.

Smuggler Bruce Welby required the latter.

Bruce tried to cross the state line with hot cargo in tow, but it didn't work out as planned and now he's been chained up by Militech border security already several days. His buddy (and Militech employee), Archibald Crane, found out about the situation through the grapevine. I'll be damned if that cuckoo corpo actually decided to help his friend instead of towing the corpo line. He contacted me to get Bruce out of his cage.

You're the missing element in this friendship triangle. Find to Bruce, break him out, and escort him to his combatta, Archie. And let's make sure Militech doesn't notice a thing, OK? Get to it.

One more thing - Archie says not to kill any corpos. So, what can I say? The client's always right.

#### （5）NCPD

##### Reported Crime: Blood in the Air

Looks like this choomba wanted to climb the turbine to fix something. Militech didn't want him to. 1 determined person + 1 unhappy corp = 1 dead dude. Easy math.

##### Reported Crime: Comrade Red

Soviets in the American desert. If that doesn't sound like a good spy story to you, go swap those ears! and check out the stash they were writing about.

##### Reported Crime: Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close

See, V? Not everyone finds a new best friend in the dump. That samurai's not waking up anytime soon.

##### Reported Crime: I Don't Like Sand

You know, there are some days when anything that can go wrong, will. Some days you burn your toast and forget your keys, other days... Militech comes and fucks you up for losing a car in a sandstorm.

##### Reported Crime: Turn Off the Tap

Seems Sandra was a bit of a partier, but lost her cash flow when she lost her job. See, V? Better not run the EDGE of financial solvency. So - how bout we check out the car she left in the corpo lot?

##### Reported Crime: Smoking Kills

Smoking used to get a bad rap, but smokers can breathe easy this day and age. Lung cancer? Buy a new lung. Throat cancer? Again, buy a new throat. Male performance problems? Mr. Stud will turn that dangle upside down. Turns out, however, the addiction itself can still lead to death. If someone nasty's keeping track of where and when you step out for a cig, well... Maybe it was better to kick the habit after all.

##### Reported Crime: Honey, Where are You?

Looks like Night City punishes love, betrayal, or indifference. Maybe all three. What we can say is there's a dead guy with a car somewhere in town. A car full of eddies.

##### Reported Crime: Roadside Picnic

Her name was Nina. And she died alone, terrified. You'll fill in the rest of the story, V.

##### Reported Crime: A Stroke of Luck

The dead don't talk, but their money sure does. Check out the house on Mallagra. Mr. skunky scuba over here sure won't be needing those eddies anymore.

##### Reported Crime: Disloyal Employee

HR in Night City is brutal. I mean, just look at how he left that exit interview! And the guy only stole tidbits of intel. Eh, well... No use crying over spilled milk. Wanna check out his stash? Let's see how much he managed to scrape together from his little side job.

##### Reported Crime: Justice Behind Bars

Looks like the prison guard was in 6th Street's pocket. Surprised? Me neither. But clearly something way bigger was being planned here. Wonder what went wrong.

##### Reported Crime: Supply Management

Another poor choom just trying to get by. All he wanted was to undercut the corps a little, make a few eds off a few boosters. Well, didn't do much for his health. Know what would give us a boost, though? A little peek at what he left behind.

##### Reported Crime: Welcome to Night City

Our Wraith dealer here chose the wrong market. He made, as they say, a deadly misstep. But now you can get something out of it, right V? Just check his stash.

##### Reported Crime: Dangerous Currents

Excise duty, audits, taxes, bribes, queues... If you want to transport something legally, you have to jump through a lot of hoops. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that many take shortcuts. Though as we all know, shortcuts can be dangerous...

##### Reported Crime: Don't Forget the Parking Brake!

Parking on a hill? Don't forget the parking brake. Otherwise, your car might start rolling downhill... Along with that valuable cargo in the trunk.

##### Reported Crime: Dredged Up

Dark, damp and the stench is enough to make you add to the muck... But there's always something interesting down there. Know what this place is? You'll find out soon enough. But before you do, better check what's in that container, see what really went down here first.

##### Reported Crime: Needle in a Haystack

Thing about containers is, they're all the same. Usually not a problem, but... Well, now you got no idea which one's got the thing you want. And that's when the plot thickens.

##### Reported Crime: One Thing Led to Another

Ah, the irony. Those gangoons installed a gadget to track the cops... And now the cops can track them right back. Technology servers no man, it seems. Zero loyalty!

##### Reported Crime: Paranoia

The homeless in Night City are frequent decenders into madness - in part because they live in perpetual fear, povery and hunger, but also due to seeing things that shouldn't be seen. The shard you just found... It could be the ravings of just another lunatic. Or perhaps something more...

##### Reported Crime: Protect and Serve

Well, well, well. This comp proves the gangoons are buying off cops right and left! We gotta do something! Like, say, grab that Tyger Claw scratch just sitting there, waiting for the police. No eddies, no corruption, right? Look at us, cleaning up these mean Night City streets.

##### Reported Crime: Worldly Possessions

Say what you will, but you ever see a stiff, it's never a bad idea to do a little rummaging. People rarely die for no reason. There's usually a bone to pick that eventually gets picked. Take, for example, some gonk who's neck deep in debt. Maybe instead of payin' it off they decide to keep it safe someplace...

##### Reported Crime: Another Circle of Hell

Choom wanted to grab someone's data, got himself burned. Clear? BURNED. But seriously - it could be worth checking the coords from his gear. Chooms like him usually have some nice toys.

##### Reported Crime: Lost and Found

Dealer torn up by hungry junkies. It happens. So, what'll it be, V? Wanna see what they got in that stash of theirs? Might just get something outta this.

##### Reported Crime: Table Scraps

Gotta have a permit to even pick through these rich assholes' sloppy seconds. Jalapeño Joe didn't, that's why he had to go. And who did him? Some fucking corpo buttlickers. Tellin' ya, the sooner we burn this city, the better.

##### Reported Crime: You Play with Fire...

Smell that, V? Another scorched runner. Wonder what he said right before he sizzled.
