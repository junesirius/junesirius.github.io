### S01E01

How do you think I am the Devil because I am inherently evil, or just because dear old dad decided that I was?

你觉得我成为撒旦是因为我生来邪恶，还是我们亲爱的老爹决定如此？

### S01E02 insecurity

说实话，我最喜欢堕落天使这个称呼，但那都是以前了，如今大家都称我为路西法（These days you just have plain old Lucifer）

——————

\- And you've left Hell behind to take a vacation in Los Angeles?

\- Well, where else would I go?

——————

喜欢用幽默掩饰不安（hide insecurity in humor）

\- What do you think I'm insecure about?

\- That you are changing, but that you don't know what's causing the change. Or who.

——————

你曾是上帝的天使中最闪亮的那一个，路西法（You were once the brightest of all of God's angels, Lucifer.）

上帝又不是没派过他最喜欢的儿子去统治地狱，对吧？（It's not like God sent his favorite son to reign over Hell before, is it?）

### S01E03 fake, lie

我终于明白我父亲对那些伪神的抱怨了（Finally, I get my father's beef with graven images.）

这是一个建立在谎言上的城市，没什么是真实的（This is a place built on lies where nothing is authentic or genuine.）

你说这里的人都很假，但我觉得人们来这里是为了改造自我（You say people are phony here, but I think people come here to reinvent themselves.）

我只惩罚有罪之人

### S01E04 power, control, influence

It's not that you're afraid that you don't have power over Chloe, it's that you're afraid that she has power over you. But neither one is true.

你害怕的不是你无法影响克洛伊，而是你害怕她对你有影响。但二者都是错误的。

People don't have power over us. We give it to them.

别人不能影响我们，而是我们甘愿被影响。

You have to take your power back.

你要把你的影响力收回来。

You're right. It's not her, it's me. I need to take back control.

我需要重新找回控制权。

I need to behave like I always have.

做回从前的我。

——————

Let's say you really are the Devil, all-powerful, immortal, blah, blah, blah.

假如你真的是撒旦，无所不能，不死之身什么的。

Does that mean you don't feel pain at all?

这是否意味着你根本感觉不到痛苦？

Well, I... I do feel something, but it's not pain so much as, uh, a pressure, a nuisance, really.

我会有一些感觉，但不像痛苦那么强烈，更像是压力或是针刺。

I do believe there's good and evil and right and wrong, but the whole fiery damnation thing, no.

我相信世间有善恶与对错之分，但那套下地狱什么的我完全不信。

Does it scare you?

No, I mean, how could I be scared of something that I don't believe in?

Do I scare you?

No.

### S01E05 上帝情结

I think I just figured it out why you do these favors.

It's about power.

It makes you feel superior. In control.

You're addicted to creating chaos and seeing where the chips fall, to hell with the consequence.

你迷上了制造混乱，看事情发展，毫不管后果。

It's like you have some kind of god complex.

就像是你有上帝情结。

### S01E06 丢翅膀

Your identity. Who are you trying so hard to become?

You keep trying on many hats to hide your horns. Playboy, cop, club owner...（你一直都在用很多身份去掩盖你的真实面目。浪子，警察，酒吧老板……）

One of the hardest things we ever do is learn to be ourselves. I want you to tell me who you believe is the real you.

——————

Every culture in the world and throughout history, for that matter, has its very own myth of the Devil.

世界上所有文明从古至今都有关于撒旦特有的神话。

But the one thing that they all have in common is that the Devil is essentially a rebellious son.

但他们的共通之处在于，撒旦在本质上是个叛逆之子。

——————

Sometimes we need to lose something before we can understand its value.

And often, our feelings of loss connect to how we feel about who we are.

Before you fell, you were known as Samael. The Lightbringer.

\- I don't go by that name anymore.

That was a name that connotated your father's love for you.（那名字代表着你父亲对你的爱）

\- Right. Was casting his son into Hell also an expression of his love?

God didn't cast you out of Heaven because he was angry with you.

\- How can you presume to know God's intentions?

Oh, I don't. I can't.

\- Then may stick within the limits of your intellectual capacity.

Oh maybe my simplicity offers me a different perspective. God cast you out because he needed you to do the most difficult of jobs. It was a gift.

\- Gift? He shunned me. He vilified me. He made me a torturer!（他驱逐了我，让我成为恶人，拷问者！）

\- Can you even begin to fathom what it was like?（你能想象这是种什么感觉吗？）

\- Eons spent providing a place for dead mortals to punish themselves?（永世管理一个死去凡人惩罚自己的地方）

\- I mean, why do they blame me for all their little failings? As if I'd spent my days sitting on their shoulder, forcing them to commit acts they'd otherwise find repulsive.

\- "Oh, the Devil made me do it." I have never made any one of them do anything. Never.

What happened to you is unfair.

\- Unfair? This is unjust. For all eternity, my name will be invoked to represent all their depravity.（永生永世，我的名字便永远代表着他们犯下的所有罪恶）

\- This is the gift that my father gave me.

It was an act of love.

\- How do you know?

Because you are his favorite son, Samael.

\- Do not call me that, please!

You are his fallen angel. But here's the thing: **When angels fall, they also... rise.（当天使堕落时，他们也在重生）**

All you have to do is embrace all that you are.（你要做的就是接受原本的自己）

\- I can't.

Yes, you can. You just have to be open to the process.（只要你愿意接受）

\- You don't understand. I can't!

Why not?

\- Because they stole them from me!

### S01E07 找回翅膀

Well, clearly you were desperate. I mean, you were willing to let a human die and unleash the wings upon the world just to remind me who I was, to fool me into desiring the wings, and the hellish throne they accompany.

Well, do you know what? It almost bloody worked.

Severing the wings was a half measure, I did leave myself an out.（当时锯掉翅膀确实是冲动之举，我确实给自己留了一条后路）

A rip cord back to the life that dear old Dad chose for me.（让我还能有机会过回老爹给我选择的人生）

But I don't need it now, because, in case I haven't made myself abundantly clear, I'm never going back to Hell.

——————

The wings are old news now.

In my search for the wings, I realized what they actually were.

A relic worth exactly what someone were willing to pay for them.（这种神物的价值只在于你愿意为它付出多少）

I've moved on to bigger and better things.

### S01E08 关于嫉妒

You're finally getting in touch with your emotions, letting your barriers down.

\- You see, that's part of the problem. I'd like them back up, thank you. Because these emotions are... bloody inconvenient, that's why.

\- The Devil doesn't get jealous. I'm the one who inspires passion in others.

——————

（Dr. Linda Martin的高超话术：）

I find people who are rude usually feel powerless in their own lives. Terrified of not being in control. But that's not you, I'm sure.

### S01E09 神父

You sound... lonely.

A friend = A peer you respect, someone you like to spend time with, someone with whom you share a meaningful connection.

——————

We all have demons inside.

We might not always understand it, but God has a plan.

\- Yes, I know. But why does everybody always think it's a good plan?

——————

\- Please tell me you didn't come out here to talk to him.

God? This is as good a spot as any.

\- Does he ever talk back?

I don't need to hear him to... hear him. If you know what I mean.

\- Well, yes, he never talks to me, either.

\- Some people are just... beyond saving.

That's where you're wrong. There's still hope for him.

\- How can you still have faith in this boy?

God has faith in him. In all of us. Even in our darkest moments.

\- You really believe that.

I do. Why don't you?

**\- Because he didn't have faith in me.**

I felt that way once, too. But now I know, deep in my heart, God has a plan for me.

\- Oh, his plan for me was quite clear.

How do you know it's finished?

Remember, Lucifer, your father... has a plan.

——————

**路西法的控诉：**

You, you cruel, manipulative bastard!

你这个冷酷无情、爱操纵人的混蛋！

Was this all part of your plan?

这都是你的计划吗？

It's all just a game to you, isn't it?

这一切对你来说就是个游戏，是吗？

Well, I know punishment, and he did not deserve that.

我了解惩罚，而他不值得承受这一切。

He followed your stupid rules, and it still wasn't good enough!

他遵守了你愚蠢的规则，可是却仍然不够！

So what does it take to please you?

到底要怎样你才满意？

Break your rules and you fall!

违反你的规则就要堕落！

Follow them and you still lose?!

遵从它们却仍然要输？！

Doesn't matter whether you're a sinner!

不管你是不是罪人！

Doesn't matter whether you're a saint!

也不管你是不是圣人！

Nobody can win, so what's the point?

没人能赢，这有什么意义？

What's the bloody point?

这一切又有什么意义？

### S01E10 弑父

You guys sound just like me and my dad. We used to fight all the time over the dumbest stuff. That's why I left.

But no matter what I did, I couldn't get away. Because every time I cooked a meal, or I looked in the mirror, there he was staring back at me.

**Because he's a part of me.**

He may have pushed too hard, and tried to make me something I'm not.

**But in the end, it made me the man I am.**

And I'm proud of who I've become.

\- Lucifer: He didn't escape his father because he turned into him.

——————

That ungrateful kid did not deserve this place. He was given everything, and he threw it all way. But it didn't matter, 'cause he was still the favorite.

\- Because he was worthy of his father's love. And he had a chance at redemption until you ruined it.

——————

Look, I know I haven't always been the easiest mom. I could be pushy, overbearing. I am sorry that you felt that you always had to be the adult. All I ever wanted was for you to be happy.

\- I know.

——————

Lucifer: We don't all turn into our parents. I mean, look at me, I don't think I've ever been the son that he wants me to be.

——————

daddy issue：永远会戳到我的topic

或许也是路西法的故事之所以这么抓住我的心的原因（之一）了吧

以及这剧本是真的不错，把三个父子/母女的故事相互穿插在一起，又不显得违和或者突兀（虽然在回过头来的时候还是会感觉得到编剧是刻意这样安排的，说明还是能感受到一点点突兀，但是在看的时候感觉还好）

最喜欢其中心理医生的片段（似乎最近看过的所有电视剧都是差不多套路了，用一个个独立案件推进主线剧情，用心理医生来让主要人物说出内心真话，毕竟对于很多人来说似乎这种场合才是真诚的，符合套路的剧包括《黑客军团》《汉尼拔》等等），以及这个心理医生Linda Martin的话术和水平是真的高，尤其从上一集跟Maze的对话和各种其他场合也能看得出情商也是真的高。

（偏题了，）所以在这里一个印象非常深的点是，小哈维尔说他在自己身上看到的都是父亲留下的痕迹，而他也为现在的自己感到骄傲。于是这不能不让我想到，我现在仍然无法跟过去的自己和解，没法真正跟childhood memory或者daddy issue和解，是否也是跟没法认可现在的我自己有关。

这也又回到第六第七集探讨的问题了，在路西法找自己丢失的翅膀时候Linda问的“Who are you? Your identity. Who do you want to be?”那些问题了。毫无疑问，我的self-identity问题也仍然是一团混乱的。或许等到我终于能理清这些问题，真正接纳我自己的时候，一切就会豁然开朗了。

### S01E11 关于做好事

I can let my guard down with you.

I don't do that with anyone else.

You make me vulnerable.

And... maybe that's okay.

### S01E12 被诬陷

What happened?

Well, where do I begin? With the grandest fall in the history of time? Or perhaps the far more agonizing punishment that followed? To be blamed for every morsel of evil humanity's endured, every atrocity committed in my name? As though I wanted people to suffer. All I ever wanted was to be my own man here. To be judged for my own doing. For that? I've been shown how truly powerless I am. That even the one person I trusted, you, could be used to hurt me.

——————

天，路西法的绝望。太让人心疼了。

甚至连自己唯一信任的人也不再相信自己，他终于对地球和人类失去了全部的信心和热情。甚至愿意主动回到地狱了。

他多么恨地狱，恨dear old Dad给他安排的eternal的生活，又是多么热爱生活，在洛杉矶在他的Lux过得舒舒服服，做他自己。而甚至这为数不多的一点乐趣，也完全因为人性而失落了。

“I have enough of it.”这是怎样极致的失望才让他说出这样的话啊。

在知道自己是mortal的情况下面对所有指向他的枪开始大笑，甚至主动招惹LAPD只为了被子弹送回他深恶痛绝的地狱。在那一刻，甚至地狱都显得比地球更加值得热爱了。

路西法，Lucie，小路。

这是怎样的不公，让你背上了所有罪恶之名。

是因为上帝的判决，还是因为人性里丑恶的那一面。

相比那些自私的、用恶魔之名掩饰自己罪行的人类，路西法又是多么善良正义的存在。“I punish the evil, but they are innocent.”“I'm evil, but I'm not a monster.”而他们才是真正的monster啊。

“我终于愿意接纳这样的自己了。”在狂怒的大笑里，路西法终于说出这样的话。“在所有的尸体上，又何妨再多增加一具。”他大笑，极尽嘲讽，看透了人性，彻底的心灰意冷。他多么恨那些不公，被迫背上与他无关的罪名，恨那个被视为罪恶象征的他自己的身份。而现在，在无数的不公之下，他心底最后一点善的防线也崩塌了。迎接罪恶，迎接不公，迎接他最恨的一切，迎接这是他不得不面对的命运，认输。

这是他从来没有做过的选择。

Lucifer，这从来不是罪恶的代名词，而是反叛的代名词。当最原初的反叛者也开始认输，也放弃了反叛，对渴望争取的一切放弃了希望，放弃了他热爱的生活、自由和正义，这个世界还剩下什么希望？天堂不再是天堂，地狱是真正的地狱，而地球，又仿佛是个比两者都更灰暗的地方了。

### S01E13 用自己交换Chloe

I don't know if this is all part of the plan. Or if you can hear me. But if you're up there... Dad... I need a favor.

I'll be the son you always wanted me to be. I'll do as you ask. Go where you want me to.

In exchange, all I ask is that you protect Chloe.

### S02E03 Why do you punish people

No one chooses to be a sin-eater (=punisher).

No one wants to to be custodian of the world's filth.

Why would they? Absorbing the worst humanity has to offer, day in and day out. Changes you.

\- So you think it's the job's fault that they started to punish?

People don't arrive broken. They start with passion and yearning till something comes along that disabuses them of those notions.

————————

Why are you a punisher? I understand the longing for justice or the joy of sweet revenge, but no one's forcing you to do this, so why would you take it upon yourself?

\- Because I couldn't take it anymore. All that evil is constantly spreading. I had to do something. I had to punish them.

You are wrong. You didn't *have to* do anything. You *wanted* to punish them.

You started with impulsive, but then you got a taste for blood, and it felt good, didn't it?

\- I was doing my part.

You had big plans to go on vengeance quest until we came nipping at your heels, at which point poor woman took the fall.

We both know you can't stop because you love it! Just like the people you punished.

\- I don't... I do. I like seeing them beg for forgiveness.

You see, the difference between us is that you became part of the problem. Someone deserving punishment

——————

So you are going to punish me anyway?

\- I am, indeed. And not because I've been brainwashed by dad or I'm trying to prove anything. I punish because I'm good at it. I like giving people their due. Makes me happy.

Which brings me to your sentence: you shall remain right here on Earth amongst the creatures you so despise as one of them.

### S02E05 What does the God want

You know that's not what your Father wanted.

\- Do I?! Everyone thinks they know what he wants. Amenadiel did when he first got here, now Uriel does. Human wars have been waged because of it. 

\- Dad showed me an open door. Does that mean I was meant to take you back to Hell, or was he insinuating that Hell was getting drafty? Nobody bloody knows because the selfish bastard won't just tell us! And I'm sick of it. No more. No more.

### S02E06 self-destruction

looking for punishment

wanted to be punished for what he had done

even though it's not his fault

a new feeling, a feeling he never felt before: guilt

Whose fault is it then?

### S02E07

\- How do you know what (job) feels right?

\- You just know.

——————

The last person I opened up to, I hurt. A lot. Let alone how I've hurt my own flesh and blood. It's all I seem to be able to do.

### S02E13

How pitiful.

Stuck in the very Hell you once ruled.

Trapped by your own guilt.

——————

好燃！！！！！！

为了你，我能付出一切

我的内疚，我的生命，我在地狱的地位和权势，跟从我的恶魔，我的母亲，我的兄弟

我放弃了一切为了站到你的身边

而所有爱我的人都与我同在

我从不孤独

所有人都爱我，所有人都爱你

这才是上帝真正的安排

不是操纵你，或者我，而是让所有人围绕爱，站到一起

只有爱能够做到这一点

### S02E15

Dad set a trap for me, but Mum was the one who made sure that I fell into... She was the one that made sure that I felt... that I... that I felt things that I don't want to feel anymore.

\- That right there, that what you stopped yourself from feeling, that's exactly what you need to feel.

What, the anger? Oh, I feel it.

\- Not the anger. The pain. That's what you've been suppressing. All the pain and heartbreak that you have over what happened with your mother. And Chloe.

\- I know it's difficult. But the only way to get over that pain... is to go through it.

### S03E04

There was this soul that I used to torture back in Hell. And like a good masochist, he'd call the shots. "Burn me." "Freeze me." "Hurt me." So I did. 

And this went on for centuries, until one day, for some reason, he missed his daily punishment. 

And when I returned, he was crying. "Please, my king," He said, "Don't ever forget me again. I promise I'll be good."

It was then that I realized he was so full of self-loathing, void of any self-respect, that no matter the depth of my cruelty, whatever miniscule attention I paid gave meaning to his pointless existence.

——————

老路，你何必又用这种伤人的话语试图推开任何靠近你的人，你的detective，你的brother，你的doctor，你又在推开他们，试图用伤害和恶毒来证明你从来没有变好。你想要找回原来的自己，by embracing the old devilish self，哪怕曾经的你拒绝那时的自己，而现在的你也在拒绝接受现在的自己。

拒绝接纳自己，huh，那不也完全就是我自己一直以来对自己的态度。我又有什么立场去说老路呢。

### S03E08

What's stupid about thinking someone deserves to be loved for who they really are?

### S03E11

又是一个把哥哥骗上拳场的小可爱，每次听路西法喊Brother都直接串戏代成锤基，而且哥俩的配置也永远都是狡猾聪明的弟弟+高傲正派的哥哥。恨铁不成钢但还总是互相袒护互相cover your ass，在最需要的时候总会出现在身边，好香。

但还是会被虐到。人总是最容易被最亲近最了解的人伤害。在哥哥说出那句“毕竟你是evil的，是Devil本尊”之后路西法那个受伤的眼神真是实在太让人心疼了。这也是之后所有的路西法大言不惭“毕竟我就是Devil”的假装骄傲的宣称的起点吧。曾经即使被贬到地狱他也只是把自己当做一个delegator，从来没有真正把自己当做邪恶或是罪恶的替身，顶多只是一个不受欢迎的反叛者。直到这个时候，他真正知道了别人是怎样看待他的，甚至连他亲爱的大哥都直呼他为邪恶的，哪怕他那个时候还是在给哥哥帮忙，而他所有的小伎俩也不过只是为了在地球稍微多享乐一会儿。

他从来不是邪恶的，他甚至没有杀过一个人。他只是一个broken soul。而broke他的人不是别人，正是他的dear old Dad，在他被堕天时站在旁边冷眼旁观的dear Mum，把他当做邪恶本尊的兄弟姐妹，把自己的罪恶都归于他的人类堕落的灵魂。于是他就这样放弃了自己。放弃坚持他原本的信仰，放弃做他自己，转而用自暴自弃的态度来作为对God的消极反抗。他挂上了Devil的面具，做那些自甘堕落的事（但其实也并没有太坏），但他也从来没有真正接纳过这样的自己。

他知道他不是恶的，但他也不能从善。他不能按照父亲希望的样子去活，因为那样就不能体现他的自由意志；但他也同样不能全部按照与父亲意志相反的模样去生活，因为那样同样没有体现他的自由意志。他不知道怎样的自己才是自由的自己，所以他反抗，他逃避，他用堕落和享乐来掩饰自己的无助和困惑。他不知道怎样才是自由，才能逃出上帝的操控，什么才是真正按照他自己的想法过的生活。

路西法，他才是真正最不知道、也最需要弄明白什么才是他的deepest desire。

So am I.

### S03E13

居然有点嗑到了路西法和该隐。假结婚这个梗真是太好嗑了，突然觉得套到银V地方会不会也一样好嗑，或者来个弄假成真或者先婚后爱梗，想想就很带感。

之前因为剧透提前知道了Pierce就是该隐，于是从头到尾都对这个角色充满了偏见，不管是一开始的那种粗鲁态度还是后来替Chloe挨了枪，总觉得他有什么不可告人的阴谋。不过说回来，就算没有被剧透，大概这也是编剧想要观众有的第一印象吧，毕竟站在女主视角，对这个上司的第一印象也绝对不会太好。但在摊牌坦言之后，真的要对自己的偏见忏悔了。The world's first murderer也不一定总是邪恶的。毕竟还有什么比在地球上永生地经历各种生命的痛苦、离别、死亡更加能让人改过自新呢。Immortality is like Hell.

“I desire... to die.”

似乎，也不是那么意外了。这种eternal punishment真是最极致的condemnation了。

（地球上的永生体名单又要增添新人了，可以把该隐跟博士、CA、叶子、莱斯特介绍认识一下了。）

老路跟该隐能够成为buddy于是也不那么让人意外了，相反，还意外地香。谁能想到这编剧会那么恶趣味地让老路跟该隐一起假扮新婚夫夫呢x 还在Chloe面前结婚，还有结婚照和婚戒，恶趣味无疑了。真正的关键在于，光是假结婚和婚戒就算了，老路还自己下厨靠晚餐？？！还“I cook, you clean”？这瞬间进入的家居模式，真是怎么都不像是假的啊！！真感觉两个人确实有那种火花感了。还有老路那句“你大概真的是整个宇宙唯一最能理解我的人了”，虽然在邻居眼里绝对是另一种意味，但是其实也没错？（Note：这些梗用来写银V也一定是绝佳）

以及后面，当两个人终于互相理解了之后，该隐把Chloe推开，老路给该隐倒酒，“你想要死亡只是因为你害怕孤独”，“永生让人无可避免地总要面对死亡和离别”，“这就是为什么你避免与人类建立联系，但行走在地球上人类之间，这一点并不是那么容易避免的”。看起来该隐真的跟小十非常像了。老路在某种程度上也是如此，孤独，害怕建立联系，渴望自由和反叛，容易受到伤害……真想抱抱这个小可怜。

PS：不知道是不是我的错觉，或者单纯出于我对路西法越来越多的偏爱和共情，最近几集似乎总感觉Chloe对他有些过分harsh了。没错，他确实是个混蛋，确实常常顾及不到旁人的感受，确实动不动玩消失以及浪荡。但Chloe，你也不是第一天认识路西法了。你不是知道他一直都是这样的吗？还是说那些生气只是因为老路跟你期望中那个温暖体贴人的理想男友形象不一致所以被piss off了？但为什么还要在老路想要弥补过失、想要证明自己有用、想要帮忙的时候用各种方式去伤害他？老路委屈的小眼神在我地方可真是太容易博得心软了。他真的有在努力，他不了解人类的情绪会怎样变化，怎样才是人类眼中的正常，因为他来地球才这么几年，他也是还在学习，用他的方式来体察他关心的人。他已经在进步，他用他的方式照顾和保护他在意的人，哪怕有些时候那些方式看起来笨拙而愚蠢，弄巧成拙，带来尴尬或是危险。另一些时候他为了隐藏那个他自己都无法接纳的内心的真实的自己而不得不隐藏的行踪和真相，他永远不停地struggle with他自己，还要把那个struggling的面好好地隐藏起来，为了保护他爱的人，或是金尽可能地不mess up with这段他第一次感受到的真正重要且真实的情感的羁绊。

他真的已经很努力了，而且肉眼可见地变得更加成熟。但只要他还在struggle，还在self-doubt真实的自我，还打不开心里那个关于自由、反叛、Dad的决定的结，他就永远没法真正享受人类的生活，真正跟Chloe拥有一段顺畅的感情路线。

所以他们现在的关系，或许用羁绊来描述会比用浪漫或是爱情之类的词眼来描述更加精准和深切。毕竟爱情在老路眼中也是廉价的，关于性或是其他容易被交易的内容，但他们的羁绊，这份用partnership建立起来的联系，这种建立在关心和信任基础上的联系，才是更强烈的。（虽然，信任的程度完全还有更多上升空间）

PPS：虽然但是，这剧里的全员感情线都是可以排列组合的吗？让我先简单梳理一下目前的全剧重要角色：

男性角色：老路、Detective Douche、哥哥

女性角色：Chloe、Maze、Dr. Linda、夏洛特

目前已知的关系：

老路-Chloe：男女主

老路-Maze：上下级，Maze对老路绝对有感情

老路-Linda：炮友

Douche-Chloe：离异夫妻

Douche-夏洛特：暧昧

哥哥-Maze：ex+炮友

哥哥-Linda：地下情

老路-哥哥：≈锤基

Maze-Linda：best friend以上

Maze-夏洛特：撩

于是得出结论，都怪老路和Maze的男女通吃，以及哥哥在Maze和Linda之间各种奇怪的暧昧不清带来的麻烦。

于是Maze这条线，在第一季几乎完全被当做跑腿打手、第二季老路对付麻麻的工具人之后，在第三季又迎来了孤独狗血剧情，虽然这种情感路线似乎并不是特别适合她。

在全员有CP的时代，Maze为什么不能有自己的真命天子呢？虽然但是，在第一季的时候真的以为Maze和Linda的羁绊实在可以进一步进展的。刚好就在老路在医生面前展露真面孔的时候，Maze和医生聊得多好啊。于是后面那段，两个人隔着上了锁的门，头靠在门上的桥段真的有被虐到。把bounty hunter的单子推进办公室又被推出来，努力了好几集终于找到了一份工作找到了自己在地球上的地位，但唯一想一起喝一杯庆祝的朋友因为受到了魔鬼的惊吓而把自己锁在了办公室里不敢再见她。那个时刻真的能感受到Maze的心碎。谁说demon没有soul？听到最好的朋友用颤抖的声音说出“You are a demon.”，哪怕这真的是事实，谁能不黯然失色呢。想必Maze在那个时刻也无比希望自己不是一个demon，哪怕那代表她真的可能会死亡。

于是又想起S02E13老路回地狱那时了，Maze说了“Demons don't have soul. When I die, I vanish. Maze out.”真正的灰飞烟灭烟消云散，就像小美人鱼的泡沫。这也是为什么demons要真正地生活在当下，要纵情声色犬马享受生命。因为这是他们唯一的机会，而且无需考虑后果。谁又能说那不是一种好的生活方式呢？毕竟在他们活的时候，他们真正地活着。

### S03E21

\- Why don't just tell her how you feel?

Because, I was afraid.

Afraid she wouldn't love you back.

### S03E23

Well done, Detective. And, uh, point taken. Well, you put away not one, but two bad guys today. All without my help. So it's become very clear that you... well, you don't need me.

That's ok, Detective, because with that realization came another.

If you don't need me, then we've been working together all this time because you want to. Because you choose to. You did choose me.

You were right. I've been trying to go back to the way things were. You know, playing our greatest hits, because I've been avoiding dealing with things in the present like... how I feel about you.

I was afraid. Afraid... that you'd want me 'cause you've only see certain sides of me. That if you saw all of me... knew all of me, you would run away.

\- Lucifer...

Detective, it's true.

\- No.

The other side of me is... it's bad. It's monstrous, even. But you wanted the truth, and you deserve the truth. Right now, I can't show it to you, so I'm just gonna have to tell you.

Detective... Chloe... I am the Devil.

\- No, you're not. Not to me.

三季了，老路终于说出来了，说出了他的真实想法，叫出了Chloe这个名字。求求了，老路和Chloe终于应该能甜了吧。

所有这害怕不被接受的面，终究还是因为自己不能接受自己。害怕自己的另一面，讨厌那一面，厌恶那样的自己，觉得自己不值得被爱。逃避，拖延，互相折磨。

Human emotion sucks.

但也正是那些broken moments，让happy moments更美好，更珍贵。

老路带血的翅膀太帅了啊啊啊啊！！！！！

翅膀的存在终于有了用武之地了。

第一次知道自己可以用翅膀来保护心爱的人，老路应该终于能感觉开心了吧QAQ

但是devil face为什么又回来了呜呜呜，好不容易第二季做了个好事，第三季又变得天使了，第四季又要回归恶魔了呜

如果devil face代表的是罪恶感内疚感这些折磨老路几千年的来自地狱的东西，我真的也很想知道老路最后能怎么样真的完全接纳自己，全部的自己，不管是恶魔的一面还是天使的一面，顺从的一面还是反抗的一面。

Chloe能接纳完整的他，他什么时候能接纳完整的自己呢？

真的不是一件很容易的事，确实，切身体验过。也真的很需要一些好的建议了。

所以Lucie, we work on it together, alright?

God: Choice is a funny thing. Give someone different options, different circumstances, will they themselves end up different?

Sure, they might end up with a different job, find inspiration from different people. But will they still be the same person at their core?（Ella）

Some might continue down a darker path, never knowing there was a different way. The potential buried deep down, but still there.（Maze）

Some make immoral choices instead of moral ones, but they'll still have the same conscience. The question is, will they ever make the choice to listen to it?（Linda）

And sometimes, it isn't the right moment in someone's life to make a certain choice. And no matter how badly you want to nudge them in the right direction, you know they need to find it on their own.（Amenadiel）

And some people find love in the strangest of situations, and are somehow, happier for it.（Dan和夏洛特）

And some, no matter how you shake things up, end up making the same choices, and drawn to the same people, the same passions.（Lucifer和Chloe）

So all seems to have ended well. Does that mean I never should've manipulated things to begin with?

I have a better question: Wouldn't you do the same in my shoes? After all, a parent just wants what's best for their child.

很有意思的平行世界梗，plus（几乎）全员恶人梗，plus全员演员梗

（as much as I want，2077的全员演员梗已经有人写过了，确实是为数不多可以把很多刀和玻璃渣圆回去的梗了）

bonus episode的特质非常明显了，也很高兴编剧终于善良了一下给Dan和夏洛特一个在平行世界里的好结局了。

以及最后的那个结论，非常发人深省：God didn't do anything. Whatever happening, is exactly what needs to happen. We choose what kind of life we live, not God. God is not manipulating anything. Nor does anyone else in our live.

PS：这个版本的平行世界看起来确实似乎还不错，但唯一的问题就变成了：Chloe是用女儿换了父亲。如果父亲不死，她就不会遇上Dan，不会有Trixie。对于一个女儿兼母亲，这个选择确实也实在太艰难了一点。

PPS：上帝的配音也实在太年轻了一点……吧？
