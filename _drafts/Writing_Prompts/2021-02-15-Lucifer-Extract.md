### S01E01

How do you think I am the Devil because I am inherently evil, or just because dear old dad decided that I was?

你觉得我成为撒旦是因为我生来邪恶，还是我们亲爱的老爹决定如此？

### S01E02 insecurity

说实话，我最喜欢堕落天使这个称呼，但那都是以前了，如今大家都称我为路西法（These days you just have plain old Lucifer）

——————

\- And you've left Hell behind to take a vacation in Los Angeles?

\- Well, where else would I go?

——————

喜欢用幽默掩饰不安（hide insecurity in humor）

\- What do you think I'm insecure about?

\- That you are changing, but that you don't know what's causing the change. Or who.

——————

你曾是上帝的天使中最闪亮的那一个，路西法（You were once the brightest of all of God's angels, Lucifer.）

上帝又不是没派过他最喜欢的儿子去统治地狱，对吧？（It's not like God sent his favorite son to reign over Hell before, is it?）

### S01E03 fake, lie

我终于明白我父亲对那些伪神的抱怨了（Finally, I get my father's beef with graven images.）

这是一个建立在谎言上的城市，没什么是真实的（This is a place built on lies where nothing is authentic or genuine.）

你说这里的人都很假，但我觉得人们来这里是为了改造自我（You say people are phony here, but I think people come here to reinvent themselves.）

我只惩罚有罪之人

### S01E04 power, control, influence

It's not that you're afraid that you don't have power over Chloe, it's that you're afraid that she has power over you. But neither one is true.

你害怕的不是你无法影响克洛伊，而是你害怕她对你有影响。但二者都是错误的。

People don't have power over us. We give it to them.

别人不能影响我们，而是我们甘愿被影响。

You have to take your power back.

你要把你的影响力收回来。

You're right. It's not her, it's me. I need to take back control.

我需要重新找回控制权。

I need to behave like I always have.

做回从前的我。

——————

Let's say you really are the Devil, all-powerful, immortal, blah, blah, blah.

假如你真的是撒旦，无所不能，不死之身什么的。

Does that mean you don't feel pain at all?

这是否意味着你根本感觉不到痛苦？

Well, I... I do feel something, but it's not pain so much as, uh, a pressure, a nuisance, really.

我会有一些感觉，但不像痛苦那么强烈，更像是压力或是针刺。

I do believe there's good and evil and right and wrong, but the whole fiery damnation thing, no.

我相信世间有善恶与对错之分，但那套下地狱什么的我完全不信。

Does it scare you?

No, I mean, how could I be scared of something that I don't believe in?

Do I scare you?

No.

### S01E05 上帝情结

I think I just figured it out why you do these favors.

It's about power.

It makes you feel superior. In control.

You're addicted to creating chaos and seeing where the chips fall, to hell with the consequence.

你迷上了制造混乱，看事情发展，毫不管后果。

It's like you have some kind of god complex.

就像是你有上帝情结。

### S01E06 丢翅膀

Your identity. Who are you trying so hard to become?

You keep trying on many hats to hide your horns. Playboy, cop, club owner...（你一直都在用很多身份去掩盖你的真实面目。浪子，警察，酒吧老板……）

One of the hardest things we ever do is learn to be ourselves. I want you to tell me who you believe is the real you.

——————

Every culture in the world and throughout history, for that matter, has its very own myth of the Devil.

世界上所有文明从古至今都有关于撒旦特有的神话。

But the one thing that they all have in common is that the Devil is essentially a rebellious son.

但他们的共通之处在于，撒旦在本质上是个叛逆之子。

——————

Sometimes we need to lose something before we can understand its value.

And often, our feelings of loss connect to how we feel about who we are.

Before you fell, you were known as Samael. The Lightbringer.

\- I don't go by that name anymore.

That was a name that connotated your father's love for you.（那名字代表着你父亲对你的爱）

\- Right. Was casting his son into Hell also an expression of his love?

God didn't cast you out of Heaven because he was angry with you.

\- How can you presume to know God's intentions?

Oh, I don't. I can't.

\- Then may stick within the limits of your intellectual capacity.

Oh maybe my simplicity offers me a different perspective. God cast you out because he needed you to do the most difficult of jobs. It was a gift.

\- Gift? He shunned me. He vilified me. He made me a torturer!（他驱逐了我，让我成为恶人，拷问者！）

\- Can you even begin to fathom what it was like?（你能想象这是种什么感觉吗？）

\- Eons spent providing a place for dead mortals to punish themselves?（永世管理一个死去凡人惩罚自己的地方）

\- I mean, why do they blame me for all their little failings? As if I'd spent my days sitting on their shoulder, forcing them to commit acts they'd otherwise find repulsive.

\- "Oh, the Devil made me do it." I have never made any one of them do anything. Never.

What happened to you is unfair.

\- Unfair? This is unjust. For all eternity, my name will be invoked to represent all their depravity.（永生永世，我的名字便永远代表着他们犯下的所有罪恶）

\- This is the gift that my father gave me.

It was an act of love.

\- How do you know?

Because you are his favorite son, Samael.

\- Do not call me that, please!

You are his fallen angel. But here's the thing: **When angels fall, they also... rise.（当天使堕落时，他们也在重生）**

All you have to do is embrace all that you are.（你要做的就是接受原本的自己）

\- I can't.

Yes, you can. You just have to be open to the process.（只要你愿意接受）

\- You don't understand. I can't!

Why not?

\- Because they stole them from me!

### S01E07 找回翅膀

Well, clearly you were desperate. I mean, you were willing to let a human die and unleash the wings upon the world just to remind me who I was, to fool me into desiring the wings, and the hellish throne they accompany.

Well, do you know what? It almost bloody worked.

Severing the wings was a half measure, I did leave myself an out.（当时锯掉翅膀确实是冲动之举，我确实给自己留了一条后路）

A rip cord back to the life that dear old Dad chose for me.（让我还能有机会过回老爹给我选择的人生）

But I don't need it now, because, in case I haven't made myself abundantly clear, I'm never going back to Hell.

——————

The wings are old news now.

In my search for the wings, I realized what they actually were.

A relic worth exactly what someone war willing to pay for them.（这种神物的价值只在于你愿意为它付出多少）

I've moved on to bigger and better things.

### S01E08 关于嫉妒

You're finally getting in touch with your emotions, letting your barriers down.

\- You see, that's part of the problem. I'd like them back up, thank you. Because these emotions are... bloody inconvenient, that's why.

\- The Devil doesn't get jealous. I'm the one who inspires passion in others.

——————

（Dr. Linda Martin的高超话术：）

I find people who are rude usually feel powerless in their own lives. Terrified of not being in control. But that's not you, I'm sure.

### S01E09 神父

You sound... lonely.

A friend = A peer you respect, someone you like to spend time with, someone with whom you share a meaningful connection.

——————

We all have demons inside.

We might not always understand it, but God has a plan.

\- Yes, I know. But why does everybody always think it's a good plan?

——————

\- Please tell me you didn't come out here to talk to him.

God? This is as good a spot as any.

\- Does he ever talk back?

I don't need to hear him to... hear him. If you know what I mean.

\- Well, yes, he never talks to me, either.

\- Some people are just... beyond saving.

That's where you're wrong. There's still hope for him.

\- How can you still have faith in this boy?

God has faith in him. In all of us. Even in our darkest moments.

\- You really believe that.

I do. Why don't you?

**\- Because he didn't have faith in me.**

I felt that way once, too. But now I know, deep in my heart, God has a plan for me.

\- Oh, his plan for me was quite clear.

How do you know it's finished?

Remember, Lucifer, your father... has a plan.

——————

**路西法的控诉：**

You, you cruel, manipulative bastard!

你这个冷酷无情、爱操纵人的混蛋！

Was this all part of your plan?

这都是你的计划吗？

It's all just a game to you, isn't it?

这一切对你来说就是个游戏，是吗？

Well, I know punishment, and he did not deserve that.

我了解惩罚，而他不值得承受这一切。

He followed your stupid rules, and it still wasn't good enough!

他遵守了你愚蠢的规则，可是却仍然不够！

So what does it take to please you?

到底要怎样你才满意？

Break your rules and you fall!

违反你的规则就要堕落！

Follow them and you still lose?!

遵从它们却仍然要输？！

Doesn't matter whether you're a sinner!

不管你是不是罪人！

Doesn't matter whether you're a saint!

也不管你是不是圣人！

Nobody can win, so what's the point?

没人能赢，这有什么意义？

What's the bloody point?

这一切又有什么意义？

### S01E10 弑父

You guys sound just like me and my dad. We used to fight all the time over the dumbest stuff. That's why I left.

But no matter what I did, I couldn't get away. Because every time I cooked a meal, or I looked in the mirror, there he was staring back at me.

**Because he's a part of me.**

He may have pushed too hard, and tried to make me something I'm not.

**But in the end, it made me the man I am.**

And I'm proud of who I've become.

\- Lucifer: He didn't escape his father because he turned into him.

——————

That ungrateful kid did not deserve this place. He was given everything, and he threw it all way. But it didn't matter, 'cause he was still the favorite.

\- Because he was worthy of his father's love. And he had a chance at redemption until you ruined it.

——————

Look, I know I haven't always been the easiest mom. I could be pushy, overbearing. I am sorry that you felt that you always had to be the adult. All I ever wanted was for you to be happy.

\- I know.

——————

Lucifer: We don't all turn into our parents. I mean, look at me, I don't think I've ever been the son that he wants me to be.

——————

daddy issue：永远会戳到我的topic

或许也是路西法的故事之所以这么抓住我的心的原因（之一）了吧

以及这剧本是真的不错，把三个父子/母女的故事相互穿插在一起，又不显得违和或者突兀（虽然在回过头来的时候还是会感觉得到编剧是刻意这样安排的，说明还是能感受到一点点突兀，但是在看的时候感觉还好）

最喜欢其中心理医生的片段（似乎最近看过的所有电视剧都是差不多套路了，用一个个独立案件推进主线剧情，用心理医生来让主要人物说出内心真话，毕竟对于很多人来说似乎这种场合才是真诚的，符合套路的剧包括《黑客军团》《汉尼拔》等等），以及这个心理医生Linda Martin的话术和水平是真的高，尤其从上一集跟Maze的对话和各种其他场合也能看得出情商也是真的高。

（偏题了，）所以在这里一个印象非常深的点是，小哈维尔说他在自己身上看到的都是父亲留下的痕迹，而他也为现在的自己感到骄傲。于是这不能不让我想到，我现在仍然无法跟过去的自己和解，没法真正跟childhood memory或者daddy issue和解，是否也是跟没法认可现在的我自己有关。

这也又回到第六第七集探讨的问题了，在路西法找自己丢失的翅膀时候Linda问的“Who are you? Your identity. Who do you want to be?”那些问题了。毫无疑问，我的self-identity问题也仍然是一团混乱的。或许等到我终于能理清这些问题，真正接纳我自己的时候，一切就会豁然开朗了。

### S01E11 关于做好事

I can let my guard down with you.

I don't do that with anyone else.

You make me vulnerable.

And... maybe that's okay.
