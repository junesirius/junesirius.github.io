### 0. case fic standard formula

(cite: qzone, original: julia-beans) early season per-episode case formula:

```
random person: *dies*
cut to Sam and Dean eating on the impala outside a food truck
Sam: so get this a random person across the country died
Dean: ok but it's probably not our thing
*it is their thing*
Scene change: Dean and Sam walking outside
Dean/Sam: hey do you really think we should be taking this case, considering the season's overarching plot line?
Dean/Sam: we've got no leads so I've got to work or I'll go crazy
Dean: hello sheriff pay no attention to the fact we look like supermodels, have ridiculous names on these clearly fake FBI badges and my brother has the same hair style as Jackie Kennedy and give us all the info on this case
random sheriff: this case? Why you FBI boys are wasting your time. There isn't a case here.
Visibly shaken white woman holding baby: this isn't like (random person) I just can't believe it
Dean: did you hear or smell anything weird? Sulfur? Cold spots? These are very official FBI questions.
Visibly shaken white woman holding baby: Of course, agents. Look I've told you everything I know, except for this mysterious hint.
*Sam swallows and looks at Dean*
*Scene change*
*Impala pulls into motel*
*research*
Sam: I think it's this thing
*it's not that thing*
Sam: get this, I think we're dealing with this thing
Dean: That's great Sammy but I think I know where the thing is going to be
Monster: attacks visibly shaken white woman holding baby
*Sam and Dean arrive just before visibly shaken white woman holding baby passes out*
Monster: *chokes Sam*
*Camera shot of Sam's face as he is being chocked*
If only Sam could reach the phone/knife/gun!!
Sam: *eyes roll back into head*
Dean: arrives in the nick of time and kills monster
Visibly shaken white woman hugs baby, she is teary-eyes: "so you're telling me monsters are real?? Thank you for saving us!! If only you could have saved that random person. I guess I'll have to move on now."
*Scene change, Sam and Dean in impala*
Dean/Sam: that was the right thing to do
Dean/Sam: but was it?
Dean/Sam: sometimes you can't save everyone
*implication that story of random person is the same as Sam/Dean's season plot line issue*
Dean and Sam look at each other
Sam is clearly nervous
Dean is stoic
Impala drives into rain
Fade to black
```

### 1.【destiel】S04E18 反乌托邦AU

Cas明明一开始过来的时候就已经想到要把那个“先知头顶有大天使罩着”的信息透露给他了吧，还非得等到Dean气得转身要走的时候才说，边说还边警惕朝天上看，大天使的监察也真是太可怕了吧，总是要弄得这么打哑谜身不由己。给完了tip还要再强调强调“now you know why I can't help/intervene”，但是真正想说的是临走前的“good luck”和关切的小眼神，总之这种口是心非说反话也真是很香了。（好像很适合去搞1984AU或者那几个类似的反乌托邦AU，华氏451AU或许也不是不可以）

（see more in S04E18观后感）

### 2.【Cas】S04E20 发生了什么

Cas想要告诉Dean什么，看着像是想要警告他一些关于大天使的事，就算在Dean的梦境里时候也非常紧张地看着天上。等到Dean赶到仓库的时候看起来已经是天使们打过一架之后的一片狼藉废墟，只剩下Cas的皮囊倒在地上，Cas自己被抓回了天堂。等Cas重新回来的时候对Dean的态度180°转变，冷漠得好像没有经历过之前20集的同甘共苦，张口就是一句“I serve Heaven and angels, not humans, certainly not you.”甚至还把Anna也抓回天堂了。

所以那一段究竟发生了什么，他本来想警告什么，他是怎么被发现的，怎么样地打了一架，被抓回天堂之后受了些什么惩罚，怎样的洗脑会让他突然变得对天堂和天使忠心耿耿啊，对人类表现出俯视态度了。

天使会动用折磨吗？抽掉了他的情感能力也许？之前那么多对order、对God的动摇，怎么就一瞬间全都清空，完全洗脑了？是对大天使或者God的恐惧让他变了态度？还是让他直面了一次God？

不过也可能这种转变是一种伪装（虽然从眼神表情看起来并不很像），不得不这样才能一边自保一边暗中对两兄弟进行支持。

（see more in S04E20-21观后感、S05E13观后感）

### 3.【Cas】S04E22 发生了什么

为了帮Dean拖时间，在先知Chuck家直面大天使的降临。在Dean临走前只说了一句“I'll hold them off, I'll hold them all off”。等到Dean再回到先知家里的时候只看见又一片天使打架之后的废墟，和Chuck转述的Cas就像“soup in the balloon”一样地爆炸了。

所以那一架的场景又会是什么样的，那时的Cas在想什么啊，直面大天使的光芒，明知道自己不可能打得过他们的，还是要为了Dean而站在那里，然后就是自己的灭亡。再然后是他的重生，他重生的时候是什么样的，有什么感觉，第一反应想到了什么，然后在重生之后的第一件事就又是跑回了Dean身边帮忙解围，顺手还杀了两个自己的天使兄弟。

还有在那之前在green room，本来明明已经拒绝Dean了，在纠结再三之后还是一脸坚毅地出现，举刀划伤自己的小臂开始画符咒，做出决定之后完全毫不犹豫了。所以他是怎么在犹豫，又怎么下定了决心的，在回去找Dean的时候是不是已经做好了自己一定会死的准备？但对死这件事仍然平淡至极

### 4.【destiel】S04E01 发生了什么

S04E16Cas说了Dean被拖下地狱之后天使siege the Pit, but they are not fast enough, 以及之前就说过的“I was the one grab you tight and raised you from the perdition.”

那个场景想想就感觉很壮观/壮烈，已经不正式地写了一些（2024-04-24-SPN-Angel-siege-the-pit.md，《Angels Siege the Pit》），感到还能写得更完整些

另一个可能只是有点偶然出现的小细节带来的想法：第四季Sam比Dean更早地用“Cas”来叫Castiel，感觉好像Sam跟Cas之前就认识，于是会想是不是在S04E01之前Sam和Cas就见过面，是Sam求的Cas去救Dean

（see more in S04E16-17观后感）

### 5.【destiel】S05E04 末日僵尸AU（R级）

那条未来Dean的时间线，可以和《The Last of Us》crossover，让那些感染病毒的人真的变成僵尸

正剧向：天使是怎么离开的，Cas怎么发现他的力量失去，他的腿是怎么受伤的，受伤的那两个月是怎么度过的，这五年他们是怎么过来的，看起来Dean是首领的前提下Cas似乎也处于一人之下其他人之上的地位，他是怎么调度领导他们的，当他们不服从管束的时候他会怎么做，一个误以为另一个可能被感染而要杀他或者被对方坚持要求杀自己但下不了手

R级：主动爬床献身的Cas，随时随地吃一口的Dean，召之即来挥之即去的两个人，Cas以为他可能会是认真的但Dean说只是玩玩，“now you're ruining all the fun”，于是Cas也变成花天酒地乱玩orgy的hippie状态，Dean在不同女人的房间里过夜，但其实两个人都感觉到了肉体上互相都最适合彼此，于是就算有时候还在赌气也可以来一发，或者很自然的angry sex，“fearless leader”惩戒下属直到脱力的Cas被弄得一团糟，dirty talk

看transcript又get到一段：

> Dean: Torture? Oh, so, we're -- we're torturing again.
>
> 2014!Dean looks at Dean.
>
> Dean: No, that's -- that's good. Classy.
>
> 2014!Castiel laughs. 2014!Dean looks at him.
>
> 2014!Castiel: What? I like past you.

“I like past you”：吃自己的醋梗+3p直接可以安排上了

（see more in S05E04观后感）

### 5.5.【destiel】S05E06 玩偶AU

Cas被敌基督变成action figure小玩偶，被不知情的Dean从店里一堆其他真玩偶堆里选出来带回家放在床头，然后第二天咒语失效发现床边站了个真angel（AU设定可能要让Dean和Cas还不熟悉互相不认识）。

或者原剧向，敌基督把Cas变成玩偶以后扔到了玩具店玩偶堆里自己跑掉了。Dean要在一大堆真玩偶里找出假玩偶真Cas，除了全都买回去一个个在房间里摆好等着其中一个自己在咒语失效之后变回来之后还有什么办法吗？

### 6.【destiel/gabstiel】S05E08 电视剧AU

Cas被snap走的时候发生了什么，为什么每次重新出现在镜头前面的时候就会变得更加伤痕累累一点，加百列把他扔到哪里去了（“He will live. Maybe”），也许是另一个电视剧AU的框架里？但是更加brutal更加monstrous，更加难以分清现实和AU，比如让他出现幻觉，或者用虚假的Dean外形的怪来困住他，只有伤害Dean才能打破那个框架，而在他犹豫的时刻他就会挨打受伤？他是怎么找到Dean他们的？也许在很多频道中间穿梭一个个地old way地找？每个不同频道里会有些不同的阻碍，要对付怪也要尽量避免被加百列发现，感觉也可以顺手把DW里出现过的一些设定搬过来套给他用。

Gabe把Cas困在电视里，就像S03E11给Sam的lesson一样，让卡一遍遍经历Dean的死或者让他不得不伤害Dean，为了让卡学会把Dean放下，但是卡怎么都在拒绝反抗，Gabe无奈+另一边Dean Sam把他困住了，只能把卡放出来

（see more in S05E08观后感）

### 7.【destiel】S05E12 灵魂交换梗（R级）

如果是Dean和Sam换了灵魂，或者Dean和Cas（跟天使换魂这件事风险似乎很大的样子），第一件事说不定（对Dean来说99.999%的肯定）会先探索自己的身体，然后，咳，如果是凹三同人的话就可以直接开始吃肉了///（然后就会发现好像很难区分到底是D/C还是C/D了，对那些介意前后顺序的洁癖来说大概会是最麻烦的AU了）

（要是拍出来的话，突然看Dean的身体说Cas那些一本正经的话，或者Cas的身体说Dean那些不着边际的话，肯定是要笑疯了的）

（see more in S05E11-12观后感）

### 8.【destiel】S05E13 时间隧道

穿越到过去，降落之后Cas颓坐着吐血晕过去了，但仍然说“it's better than I expected”，他到底expect了什么啊，直接can't make it死在穿越的路上掉进时间缝隙吗，还是降落的时候自己已经失去意识没法把他们带回去了？还是剩下的力气全都为了保护他们两个然后自己是全身上下残破不堪鲜血淋漓地降落的？

突然脑了一下time travel的路途其实不是“嗖”一下过来的，而是真实的有一条像DW一样的在更高维度的时空隧道，而他们从那条隧道穿过来的路上并不是直白的通畅安全，他需要动用剩下不多的天使之力让他们在这条路上前进，同时也要分出心神跟那条路上出没的各种以时间为食物的怪做对抗。要是无法前进就会困在时间隧道里，困在未知的没有时间概念让人发疯的时间空隙，要是被怪拖走杀死就会真的死在这里，而他能做的最后一件事可能只有把两兄弟从某一个随机的时间点推出去，而他们在没有别的天使帮忙和找得到的情况下就会被永远困在那里。而这个维度是只有他作为天使才能看见的，所以不管发生什么两兄弟也都帮不上忙。所以在那个穿越过程中（他只用了简单的“time travel is difficult”来概括，其实危险程度远远不止），他不得不拼力搏斗，各种失血受伤，用自己的身体保护无知无觉的两个人类，等到落地的时候已经耗尽了力气，几乎是直直坠落下来的。在跟怪打斗的时候他甚至怀疑过自己这次是否真的能make it，等到终于落地而自己还保有意识，所以才会说better than expected。

但回去的路，比来的时候还要糟糕。在1978休息了五天，醒醒睡睡，意识浮浮沉沉，然后终于恢复了些力气。他感觉到了米迦勒降临，也知道两兄弟已经被完好无损地送回去了，于是放下心来，然后又在新的一阵眩晕里昏睡过去。终于能够再支撑自己的身体皮囊站起来的时候他就走上回去的路了，但是这时的自己面对那些虎视眈眈的时间的兽，还是太过虚弱了。他本来以为是因为残余的天使之力所剩无几，用尽力气打退几只才反应过来大概是因为两兄弟不在自己身边。这次不是为了他们，只是为了自己，于是似乎爆发不出那样强大的保护欲了，于是也没有足够力量对抗那些兽和这条路上的其他障碍了。这次他真的以为自己做不到了，力竭之后被兽群拖走撕咬，他已经闭上眼睛要放弃希望放弃抵抗了。然后大脑的一个角落浮出Dean的声音，跟他说他们还在原来的时间点等他回来，他们还需要他，于是他继续挣扎地往前。他完全不知道自己是怎么回到2010的，摇摇晃晃，踉踉跄跄回到两兄弟待的旅馆降落在Sam身后，虚弱得气若游丝（“I did it? I'm actually surprised.”他本来是真的以为自己回不来了），被两兄弟一人一边地接住，知道自己安全了，于是意识一放松又晕过去了。

### 9.【destiel】S05E14 被放大的欲望（R级）

如果Cas和Dean都确实对彼此有些克制住的念想，而Famine激活和放大了那些hunger/desire，于是他们陷在无休无止的翻云覆雨的欲望里了。而最初的那一步是Cas迈出的，因为他更容易地就受到了影响。

（see more in S05E14观后感）

### 10.【destiel】新衣服

感觉Cas的风衣好像很容易弄脏弄破损，S05E13吐血的时候第一反应就在想“糟了风衣要弄脏了”，S04E01一见面也是直接当胸一枪，Cas人没事但是风衣怕是破了吧。不知道会是用天使力补衣服还是手动补？感觉两个都很好笑很可爱。

脑了一个Dean带着Cas逛商场买新衣服（突然变成小情侣日常），虽然很可能“新”衣服也只是新的二手衣服，比如在thrift store之类的地方淘白菜价的质量不错的二手服装。

### 11.【Cas】天使之死

Cas死了很多次，S04E22里“exploded like a water balloon of chunky soup”，S05E22里“explodes in a rain of blood and chunks of meat”。关于死亡瞬间的体验，还有复活是什么感觉，或许可以写一写。

### 12.【Cas】S04E10 关于堕天的疼痛

> Pamela: She fell to earth, became human.
>
> Sam: So, angels can just become human?
>
> Anna: It kind of hurts. Try cutting your kidney out with a butter knife. That kind of hurt. I ripped out my grace.

严格来说S05的Cas慢慢向人类转变的过程和Anna的直接剥除grace的堕天不完全一样，但仍然想要借用一下这段“cutting your kidney out with a butter knife”式的疼痛，what if他的battery draining过程也是伴随疼痛的，what if it hurts and he never says, until one day Dean finds out。

### 13.【Lucifer】S06E01 被复活的Sam

这个谜底揭晓是soulless Sam的存在，在猜测他的身份的时候有过很多想法，其中一个是：What if this *is* Lucifer，只不过是被抹掉了天使成分和记忆的路西，作为punishment and a lesson。所以才会这样守序中立偏邪恶，没什么道德感，但本能地对哥哥仍然很好。What will he do, what does he think, how does he perceive the human world，等到捡回记忆的时候又会对人类世界有什么改观的看法。感觉也有很多可以poke的故事。What will happen, who will he meet, how would he change.然后发现好像有点像是走向剧版路西的道路了x，希望还是不要重复那条路线吧。

（see more in S06E01-07观后感）

### 14.【Cas】S06E03 heaven civil war

单纯想看Cas在heaven civil war主战场上的样子，两队天使开战，Cas进入true form跟Raphael对抗，两边打得天昏地暗的样子。似乎不是我的文笔可以描绘出来的画面，但至少可以让大脑想象一下热闹一下了。战场上的Cas会超级帅吧！别的不说，那大翅膀还是要展开一下才能让人满足的x

（see more in S06E01-07观后感）

### 15.【destiel】S06E10 porn（R级）

剧情里都直接已经出现让Cas看porn和有boner反应了（确实也是越来越human的一个表现），所以不能怪我脑Dean按照porn风格给Cas一些sex教学。

（see more in S06E10-11观后感）

### 16.【destiel&sastiel】S06E11 "go ask your boyfriend"

Balthazar直接脱口而出称呼Cas是Sam的boyfriend了，Sam甚至也极自然地就应下去了。甜度高得有点一下子不适应被齁到了。

所以难道这就是Cas在天堂的名声了吗，连自己的好buddy都这么乱传谣说他在地面上有人类boyfriend了？想象了一下又确实被笑到了，看Cas对自己身边传起来的谣言一无所知但是其他天使开始对他为什么对人类这么热心这件事做恍然大悟状。关系好的天使对他表示理解，敌意的天使冷嘲热讽。Cas花了好一会儿才catch up他们在流传什么，想要一本正经纠正但是没人真的信他，然后他开始怀疑自己是不是对boyfriend这个词的理解出了什么错，然后下来问Dean（或者Sam）boyfriend的定义，然后被Dean一阵笑话然后再慢慢地教他人类对这个概念的定义，然后Cas会发现他们好像符合了每一条定义，然后Dean越说越感觉不对劲（这个时候好像如果不真的答应一下很难收场了呢）。

（see more in S06E10-11观后感）

### 17.【destiel】天使猫猫

就像尼尔盖曼那篇他家黑猫其实是天使的故事，Cas可以是温家天使猫，keep the monsters outside，但是把自己弄得伤痕累累。

### 18.【destiel】S06E18 Dean hunt黑化Cas

> Rachel: Castiel, I've been hearing things. Things I don't want to believe. Just tell me if it's true.
>
> Cas: If what's true?
>
> Rachel: You know. Your dirty little secret.
>
> Cas: I have to defeat Raphael.
>
> Rachel: Not this way, Castiel.
>
> Cas: Rachel.
>
> Rachel: We put our faith in you, and... look what you're turning into.
>
> Cas: I don't have a choice.

“not this way”“look what you're turning into”，到现在还不知道Cas到底做了什么，but it can't be good，想到的最糟的事情可能会是在planning massivee massacre来批量收集人类灵魂。想到了Dean很久之前对喝血的Sam说过的“If I don't know you, I'd want to hunt you”，想象这种情况或许也可以用在黑化或者夺魂版的Cas身上，让Dean hunt him down。

（see more in S06E17-22观后感）

### 19.【Cas】S06E20 自白的自我厌恶

那么多动摇，那么多怀疑自己是否做的是对的，很多时候明明自己也知道那些是肮脏的、糟糕的，but he has to，因为另一个选项更加糟糕得无法承担后果。所以在做那些举动的时候，跟demon合作，being their whore，do what they ask，他是那样厌恶不得不这样做的自己，他甚至不愿意再出现在Dean和Sam面前了。他无法面对他们，知道他们有questions he can't answer，知道这样的自己只会disappoint他们。他害怕，害怕他们不再把他当做朋友，害怕他们用怀疑的仇恨的眼神看他，把他当做朋友。这样自我厌弃的Cas，又会做出多少无人知晓的自我伤害的事以求让自己的内心好受些呢？

（see more in S06E17-22观后感）

### 20.【Cas】S06E20 Cas的自杀倾向

Cas的天堂是“the eternal Tuesday afternoon of an autistic man who drowned in a bathtub in 1953”，尤其是结合那一段的画面，空中的风筝，后院草地，隔着屏幕感觉得到的微风——很平静，很忧伤，很孤独，也很有死亡气息。而这竟然是Cas的天堂。Cas和这位autistic man之间有些什么联系呢，还是因为Cas自己也有类似的自杀倾向？倒是可以解释每一次这么着急自我牺牲了。

感觉可以写一段心理咨询室的故事。

### 21.【sastiel】S06E21 Cas从Cage救Sam

Cas提到了是他把soulless Sam从关Michael & Lucifer的Cage里捞上来的，所以他是怎么做到的呢，冒险进到Cage里的时候会不会被Michael和Lucifer打一顿？还要在把Sam捞出来的同时阻止Michael和Lucifer出去，他自己都说了难度超级大的，所以到底发生了什么，怎么做到的，他自己是不是也受了不轻的伤才做到的但是把过程都一句话带过了。

（see more in S06E17-22观后感）

### 22.【DW x SPN】S07E03 Amy Pond

需要吸食人类下丘脑的狐妖Amy Pond crossover DW的Amy Pond，于是很容易把DW和SPN crossover到一起来了。博士这种外星人对温家兄弟来说也是supernatural吧，他们会擦出什么样的火花呢？一起联手拯救世界才对吧。

### 23.【Cas】S07E17 失忆梗

> Cas: A few months ago, she was hiking by the river, and I wandered into her path, drenched and confused, and... unclothed. I had no memory. She said... God wanted her to find me. She found me and cared for me.

赤裸的湿漉漉的Cas从河里走出来，茫然的，失忆的，不知道自己是谁，被Daphne姑娘捡回家照顾。然后发现自己可以heal，不用进食，开始帮助别人，“healing the sick, curing the crazy”，帮那个叫Mackey的hunter治好了眼睛。可以写一写在Dean找到他之前的这一年，Cas都是怎么过来的。没有别的天使恶魔Leviathan找到过他，倒也是难得很安静的lay low的一年呢。

然后是被Dean找到了知道了自己是Cas，但是完全没有记忆，也没有通过smite demon来重新恢复记忆。就像第六季的Sam重新走自己在soulless时候走过的路来捡回记忆的bits and pieces，Cas也开始重走自己在God时候走过的地方想要回想起自己做过些什么，想起来得越多，他对自己的害怕也越深，对Dean和Sam越愧疚，整个人开始变得越来越破碎。但仍然坚持要找下去，知道自己犯过错误，但是要先知道那些错误是什么才能开始弥补。所以Dean也只好陪着他一起找下去。

（see more in S07E17观后感）

### 24.【sastiel】S07E17 幻觉路西、自杀倾向

幻觉路西的存在不是因为灵魂多了一块路西，而是因为灵魂在折磨中被破碎损毁了（Cas说过他的灵魂摸上去就像被活剥了一层皮的），所以路西的存在是一种空洞、一种缺失。所以Cas把“路西”从Sammy大脑里转移到自己身上的时候，其实不是把存在的多出来的这块路西转移到自己身上了，而是更像把自己的灵魂一部分转移到了Sammy身上，把路西制造出来的碎片和空洞填补上了，而自己灵魂开始出现了漏洞，所以他也开始看见幻觉路西了。

这个幻觉路西在Sammy脑子里的时候就非常努力地劝他自杀而Sammy靠自己意志顶住了（the devil's voice at the back of my head这种事，it happens a lot），但是Cas，这么重的内疚，比Sammy重得多得多，就算没有路西也已经觉得自己deserve to die了，现在再被路西一掺和，感觉只会更加极端地去寻死了吧。想看两兄弟拯救努力想要自杀的Cas然后用原谅和爱来拯救他的负疚感。

（see more in S07E17观后感）

### 25.【Cas】S07E21/23 破碎的Cas

他说“it took... everything to get me here”，真的很想知道这everything到底包含了什么。想看他的视角的世界，他的幻觉，他努力把灵魂碎片重新集中到一起。在他飘忽的注意力里，隐约感到好像看见了那些碎片在水面上飘浮的样子。他好不容易终于把那些碎片都集中到一起了，但是没法让他们重新组合起来，构建出原来的完整样子。所以他的大脑只能偶尔专注在其中一片上，在那一片在水上漂到旁边的时候再捡一片，说出的话就跟着那一片的关注焦点转过去了。他太忙于捡这些七零八落的碎片来维持外在那个还能说话交流走动的自我，以致他实在没有多余的精力和注意力去关注周围人的心情和他们担心的事。他知道他们一定在讨论一些重要的事，有时他也能捡到正确的碎片来提供给他们重要的信息，但这样的注意力对现在的他来说太难维持了，就像ADHD的小孩子，或者其实就像任何一个小孩子，他很快又转而开始讲蜜蜂和昆虫和狗和小孩子的游戏，那些在“成年人”眼里完全不重要的事。不喜欢争吵，会被大声的说话声吓到，他变回了一个纯粹的小孩子，而Dean他们想要的是一个成年人，一个能帮他们解决问题的人，for once，Cas变成了那个需要他们帮助的问题。

Cas怎么在昏迷中用尽力气才把自己灵魂拼起来，至少可以醒过来可以说话走路了，但仍然是破碎的，注意力随着这些好像在水上浮着的碎片漂来漂去，这就是为什么他没办法把注意力完全集中在一件事上了。不喜欢争吵，会被大声的说话声吓到，喜欢小孩子的游戏，喜欢观察蜜蜂和昆虫。几乎完全像是个孩子了。

注意力漂走的时候掺进来的那些零碎的无关的话，常常让正在紧张对话的人开始不耐烦甚至发脾气（尤其是Dean），但是也可以透露一些他的破碎状况。那些飘过来掺进对话的碎片也是他的一部分，也都是他曾经或者现在关注的问题，比如那些猫猫狗狗，还有很多的蜜蜂。又想起了他的天堂是1953年溺亡在浴室里的自闭症患者的周二下午，那种孤独忧郁的氛围从一开始就包围着他，感觉突然也很容易理解他为什么会突然想要全心全意地观察蜜蜂了，这其实……非常符合他的性格。

可以想象一下他的灵魂世界到底是什么样子，那些碎片是什么样子，他怎么才做到的把自己拼起来，但现在仍然是碎的，在注意力跑偏的时候他的灵魂世界又在发生什么。是什么让他破碎成这个样子的。

想象他走在自己思维宫殿里，原本排列整齐的图书馆知识库现在是一片狂风过境的书的废墟。漂亮古典高耸到建筑穹顶的书架仍然立着，但所有的书四散在地上，堆得一团糟，书页四散飞舞。他已经用了最大的努力把这个图书馆重新拼凑让四壁树立起来，让书架回到它们原本的位置，但那些书，那些四散的纸页，要把这里的所有东西都归位实在需要太多太长的时间了。他已经在努力了，东一本西一本地捡地上的书，读出纸页上的字，费劲地想要搞明白那些东西原本都应该放在哪里，但没有了索引没有了页码，要把他们重新按顺序放回去实在太难了。当他在自己的思维宫殿里念出那些纸页上的内容时，外面的那个他也会忍不住把那些句子大声地说出来，于是他就被所有人认为疯了，认为broken，but they really should take a tour inside, see what he's dealing with, see how hard he already works, see how good he already is and how rare it is。

### 26.【Cas】S07E21-23 失控的Cas在害怕崩溃中时间穿越

谁知道一只崩溃失控的天使会做什么？也许会毁灭世界，也许会杀光所有恶魔甚至人类，也许会害怕得逃走，逃到时间流里，穿越到了不知道什么时代，Dean和Sam又怎么样才能重新找到他？只靠Meg坐在病床旁边看杂志又能起到什么效果？

想看崩溃的Cas突然穿越到了各种历史事件中，比如走在维多利亚时代的街道上平复心情，然后被那时代的人用奇怪的眼神打量。也许会遇到其他穿越时间的旅行者，也许又会遇到吸血鬼（《发现女巫》第二季），也许为了逃脱那些更大的conflict终于又重新跑回原本的时间线了，发现Dean和Sam都着急得不得了。也可以很容易地跟DW crossover了，Meg的last name又正好是Masters，好像非常方便用来制造矛盾误解让博士也惊慌一下了。

### ~~26.1【destiel】S07E21-23 疯卡穿越时间线改变历史，丁帮忙修复历史【done】~~

（来自上面的梗，但是上一个还能用来做更多的crossover衍生，先不划掉）

《White Butterfly》（标题含义：蝴蝶效应+白色纯洁疯卡，白色病服）

在quarrel之后飞走到过去时间线，然后不是飞回来的，而是take the long way，慢慢等着时间流逝然后才回到现实时间线，几千几万年的时间对天使来说都不是什么太长的时间。第一次在game room，其实不是他直接飞到了同时间线的game room，而是飞回去了好几个小时，一个人在那里玩游戏自娱自乐，知道丁他们那个时候不会出现，所以他是安全的。等他们来的时候他已经一个人安静了很久，自我疏解好了。第二次倒回去更久，以此类推

他想要帮忙，想要让世界变得更好，所以他倒回去改变历史：中世纪女巫审判，庞贝，智人尼安德特人，陨石撞地球恐龙灭绝，第一条上岸的鱼，地球的诞生

一不小心或者故意干扰了太多的时间线，每一次改变都会让现实时间线的他们见证蝴蝶效应后果，参考泰坦尼克集，reality break apart，代价是卡要被reality的paradox裂缝吞噬掉，碎裂在时间线里。他像个犯错的小孩子一样回到现实时间线了，丁温求他带着自己重溯路线，重置他做的改变，被迫把他原本救下的人又重新像原本一样死去了，一起全部重新经历一遍，丁从卡视角看到了broader world view，看人类进化和地球诞生，看卡非人的一面和人类的一面，敬畏又心疼

### 26.5.【Cas】S07E21 the me then is not the me now

继续上面的想法但是换个角度

如果卡在conflict之后飞走到Day Room是time travel back了一段时间再慢慢回来的，那每次conflict之后都飞走，都要在上一个自己飞走之后进入避免paradox，那就意味着每次要飞回去更远的时间线来确保day room一直是对他available的，直到他飞到day room创建的第一天，没法继续往前追溯了

丁他们知道他这样在穿越还是因为他说漏了一句“Did you know...”关于day room的创建时间，“I was there”

需要找到新的coping mechanism

### **27.【Cas/Gabe】S07E21/23 为什么破碎的Cas这么害怕争执《Sunday Dinner》**

《Sunday Dinner》

突然似乎理解了他为什么会这么害怕争端，一被吼就很不高兴地瞬移跑走了，缩在角落里一个人玩游戏来缓解心情：这简直完全就是一个从小被家暴的孩子的模样，这样的争端和大声说话让他想起糟糕的过往回忆（童年回忆？）。重新想到了加百列说过的Armageddon只是他们家的Sunday dinner，不想再看他们争吵的加百列离家出走了，那么一直待在那里的小孩子们呢？比加百列小的Cas，是不是总是缩在餐桌角落看哥哥们暴力地吵架打架，或者在隔壁的儿童桌旁边背对哥哥们堵着耳朵不想听，但是家具玻璃摔碎的声音还是隔着手指传进来？害怕自己会变成哥哥们的出气筒，害怕这样的闹剧会让这个家分崩离析。然后在这样的环境里长大，变成一个decent的炽天使，把那些糟糕的童年记忆都埋下去，甚至连Dean这样亲密的（唯一的）朋友都没有告诉。他以为自己已经长大了，已经度过了那种因为争端而陷入惊慌恐惧的年龄段，直到这灵魂碎片又把这一切都重新带了回来。在那些最糟糕的时候，他好像又变成了当初的刚诞生不久的小天使，瑟缩在餐桌角落，或者偶尔躲回自己的房间，假装玩游戏，强迫自己把注意力放在面前的玩具和游戏上，希望这样就能听不见外面越来越响的争吵声。这就是为什么争端这件事突然变得如此triggering。

Cas逃避争执不知道能做什么的时候就用游戏来平静自己内心转移注意力，是不是因为当争吵升级的时候他好不容易维系在一起的灵魂碎片就可能崩溃？就像Sammy的崩溃信号是重新捡回记忆，Cas的记忆倒是仍然保持着了，只是就像个积木高楼大厦，只有保持心情平静才能让这些积木勉强保持住搭建起来的形态。他知道现在这个状态有多难保持，“took everything to get here”，也知道当他的大脑开始被conflict占据就会像是这张搭积木的桌子被猛烈摇晃，他费劲一切搭建起来的自己的理智（already the best he can get）又会分崩离析，所以他只能选择逃离争执现场，逃到安全的角落去以自我保护。而Dean knows nothing。

### 28.【Cas】S07E21 地球的边界守望者

> Castiel: They're from the Garrison - my old Garrison. Looks like Hester's taken over. <u>We were assigned to watch the earth. Often, it was boring. The wars were very boring and the sex - you know, the repetition.</u> Anyway, I was, uh... I was their captain. Isn't that strange?

地球的边界守望者，有时会开始感到无聊，突然想看他在上面看特洛伊战争，边看边吐槽，想必也是会被他归到无聊一类里了。想看他统领他的边防部队，在必要的时候下指令，但几千年了都没有派天使降临到地球上的需要，直到S04E01他亲自下来了。（突然想到不知道帕梅拉第一次偷看Cas的时候Cas是在做什么呢，如果是正好衣冠不整比如在盥洗室时候的尴尬时刻，好像也不能指责他burn her eyes呢，毕竟谁会喜欢不提前约好时间的video meeting）

### **29.【destiel】S08E02 炼狱的时间流速**

在看见Dean说“Nice peach fuzz”的时候突然有了个脑洞，在想之前从来没在天使身上看见过这样明显的时间流逝痕迹，总是well-shaved、发型着装总是同一个模样。于是忍不住想，这络腮胡的出现，是否说明炼狱里时间终于开始在天使身上流逝？如果胡须毛发开始生长，那么身体的其他部分也一定正在出现自然的生理变化，而对这具人类身体来说，出现生理变化就意味着衰老，意味着向死亡进发。所以或许炼狱对天使来说，最可怕的地方不是怪物，是时间开始流动？而如果增加一个设定说这样的时间流逝带来的变化是不可逆的，那么很快就会出现一个衰老梗了。Dean在炼狱显然没有遭遇同样速度的时间流动（胡子没有长那么长就是一个证据），所以炼狱的不同位置或者对不同物种的流逝速度是不同的？对天使这样的永生生物，它的流速反而极快，于是哪怕永生也很快就要看见末尾了。想象Dean在重新遇到Cas的时候Cas已经垂垂老矣，Dean不知道这只是vessel的衰老还是天使确实就这样极速衰老了，就像《孤独的心》里的贝拉，就像S05E07男巫那一集本杰明巴顿AU的Dean，就像圣诞小镇的小十一或者被法师诅咒了衰老的小十（突然这才意识到DW对衰老梗好像非常情有独钟）。他们朝出口走，走得越近，Cas身上的衰老速度也越快。炼狱试图用时间为代价阻止天使出去，而这奏效了。等到他们离出口足够近了，Cas也虚弱衰亡到再无法前进一步的程度了。“你们走，不要管我了。”他会说。Dean会暴怒地拒绝，想要把他背起来抱起来或者拖着也要带他走出炼狱。但衰老带来的死亡已经追上了天使，Dean听见薄如蝉翼的皮肤下面衰朽的骨骼的吱嘎声，他的面前只有一个老人，不再有他的天使Cas。再然后，连这个老人也没有了，他扑簌地碎去，变成光的粉末，再变成上升的烟雾。Dean的面前空无一人，好像Cas从来没有在那里过。

### 30.【destiel】S08E07 Cas复活的魂器假说

怎么好像每次Cas陷入危难都非得要靠外挂才能拉回来，没人知道到底是怎么回事，每一次复活都是怎么实现的，然后突然想到了一个神奇的理论：魂器。如果Cas的灵魂一直不是完整的，比如他的一部分在S04E01把Dean从地狱拉回来的时候附着在Dean身上了，那就能做到只要Dean不死Cas也不会死，而如果Dean死了Cas凭自己能力也能让Dean复活，所以这就好像手动卡了个bug实现永生了呢。

### 31.【Cas】S08E07 从炼狱回归的不是完整的Cas

S08E07，脏兮兮的Cas突然重新出现在Dean面前，很惊喜但也有点太突然了。前两次看见的时候连Dean都觉得是幻觉，于是忍不住想说不定现在这个看起来好像回来了的Cas也是幻觉的一部分？只不过用了些天使技法让这个幻觉变得特别真实，看起来跟本体差不太多，甚至也能动用一部分天使力，但其实真正的本体还在炼狱里呆着，这也解释了为什么现在这个Cas用不出全部的天使力，连杀一些小恶魔都会费力疲惫。差不多类似像Benny搭了灵魂顺风车跟着Dean逃出炼狱，Cas也把一部分的自己附着在Dean身上了。远程跟还在炼狱的本体还有些灵魂链接，可以看到听到外面那部分自己看见听见的事，在两兄弟需要帮助的时候及时出手相助，完全就好像他自己在外面了一样，仍然继续做他们的守护神。但刚出去的时候那部分灵魂和天使力都还太虚弱，还没法凝聚成实体，只有一个幻影，他不想吓到他们，或者被他们发现自己从来没有出来，所以花了些时间修炼。等到终于凝成实体、自己通过镜子觉得看不出什么破绽了之后，才重新去找两兄弟、出现在他们面前。而显然他们相信了他就是他自己。至于为什么坚持让自己的本体仍然留在炼狱（有这样的实力能让部分的自己投射到外面，显然也是有足够的实力把整个的自己带出去的吧，于是不出去显然只能是因为自己不想出去了），理由大概是跟S08E08他和Dean谈心时说的是一样的，他需要这样的自我惩罚来作为一种弥补。

### 32.【destiel】S08E07 天使围攻炼狱

天使围攻地狱救Dean的时候就伤亡惨重，围攻炼狱救Cas的时候又是伤亡惨重，但是对比过来的Dean一个人杀出炼狱什么事也没有，所以这说明什么，天使能力太弱了吗？但是仍然，有点想看战斗大场面呢，看天使们是怎么围攻入侵炼狱的。不过天使群里没有别的喜欢角色了，倒很难激发热情，Cas光是被救也没什么意思。或者可以稍微借用一下设定改改剧情，比如Cas那个时候是在外面的，或者千辛万苦率先撕开炼狱冲出去了，然后要跟天使们一起入侵炼狱捞Dean，那就跟上一次围攻地狱有种平行感了，只不过这一次要面对的是monster不是恶魔，也算有点区别变化，也是可以想一想的。如果天堂可以用暴力入侵炼狱和地狱，那么炼狱和地狱的门就不是完全安全的，这种安全漏洞在之后也是很好利用的吧，比如开个back door什么的。

也想看他们为了强行冲出炼狱所以在边界上撕出了个洞，怪物现在就能从洞里出来走到外面世界上了，他们又要开始研究怎么缝补这个洞。这简直可以是一整季正剧的内容。

### 33.【destiel】S08E08 Dean的梦（R级）

> Dean: Okay, well, I need my four hours, so...
>
> Castiel: I'll watch over you.
>
> Dean: That's not gonna happen.

说不准Cas是真的喜欢看人睡觉？或者说也不是“喜欢”，只是作为其中一件观察人类的事，天使不会睡觉，不会做梦，所以他是不是站在那里看熟睡的Dean的时候在想睡觉到底是什么感觉，梦又是什么。人类的头脑里到底是什么样的，太过复杂，是单纯直白的小天使无法完全理解的。又想到，天使明明可以通过精神链接远程进入梦境来通话，所以想象一下Dean有时在梦中见到Cas，以为只是自己的梦的一部分，其实是Cas按捺不住好奇通过精神链接自己走进去看了，不想被发现是入侵所以跟着Dean假装自己是他幻想出来的样子……（后面好像就可以无缝衔接寻常凹三梦设的肉文剧情了，不可能没有人写过，说不定已经是写烂了的梗吧）

### 34.【Cas】S08E08 天使大脑是无线电接收器

> Cas: Something's coming across the police band. It's all waves.

天使大脑居然自带内置无线电接收器，可以直接调制成接收各种不同频率信号，明明本来是个超自然特质突然感到非常科学了。光和声音也不过是不同波长频率的信号，天使说话声音是亚波长，无线电频率低于300GHz，人耳能捕捉到20-20kHz，那么天使能接收0-300GHz好像也不是什么特别稀奇的事了。

突然感觉好像很多超自然设定也可以用科学方式进行设定或者研究（比如HP的《理性之道》的SPN版本），天使的本体形式是光，接收信息的方式是高频无线电；恶魔的本体形式是黑烟，通话方式是人血加上咒语；各种不同符咒能保护或者驱逐不同种族，把驱逐咒倒着念就能变成束缚咒，等等等等。感觉会很难写，因为设定总是很快地在变，也没有一个像霍格沃兹一样比较成熟的各门派教学体系，毕竟魔法也只是超自然里很小的一支，康斯坦丁的梗池里有过的那个超自然学院可能才能容纳更多可能性。

跑偏了，其实最初想象的只是未成年小天使Cas被塞进了人类高中学校，然后在物理实验室做电磁实验的时候偷偷作弊，直接用大脑接收到的频率写了实验结果，过于准确了结果因为跟理论不符被打了低分，想跟老师争辩但是又不能说真话不服也得憋着，噗感觉很好笑很可爱（咳，吐槽一下，明明可以用这个电磁波能力做到太多物理学界人类做不到的事，结果想象到的居然只有在高中物理实验课上作弊，感觉格局还是小了些x）

想到久远看过的另一本科普书，应该是伽莫夫的《从一到无穷大》，至今印象深刻里面把电子云宏观化了之火的那段故事的既视感，没记错的话还有一张插图（也有可能只是自己读的时候颅内出现的画面）。隐约记得也有很多其他类似风格的书，可能叫《What if》（查了一下居然印象又是对的，“serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions”），通过改变一些很小的点就能通过物理推演想象出各种特别神奇的后果，超自然，但是又很科学合理，看得欲罢不能（好nerdy哦）。

于是天使的这个电磁接收器设定也是很容易被同理沿着科学方向扩展思维了（可惜我的电磁学从来没学得特别好过），比如每天能被多少信息量吵到，能听到多少东西（像DD那样只是有个特异耳朵的人类就能听到几条街外的心跳声，天使不是更容易搜查各种动静了吗？还是说这正是Cas怎么在S06E03做到的两秒钟搜完了整个镇子找人？）。如果不能关掉那部分频段的话，恐怕真的是很容易被这么多声音和信息吵得疯掉，比如光是能听见所有人的心跳这一点就已经很折磨人了，但是适当训练之后就能很方便地当做测谎仪来用。想看一个还没学会关闭频段的小天使被大脑里的各种声音折磨得快疯了，然后Cas去帮他教他怎么区分、挑选、调频、静音。

想看天使的这种特异能力被一个疯子物理学家知道了，Cas被捉去做实验，物理学家想要把Cas做成一台大型实验仪器来帮助完成一项诺奖级别的研究，美其名曰要是研究成功的话可以帮助多少人类或者研发出多少设备（一开始可能也正是用同样的理由骗到Cas的）。人类没有特异能力只靠知识和科学就能上天入地开拓宇宙，怎么天使恶魔全都只是局限在地球上没想过去太空呢？（这也是《理性之道》提出过的疑问）所以这位科学家的追求也可以是想要利用天使的能力帮助人类更快地穿梭宇宙去遥远的星系了。然后被绑起来的Cas可能会说“I assure you there is nothing else in the other side of the universe, I've been there, the Earth is the best place.”，他大概很可能是真的去过的，但这些疯子物理学家、天文学家肯定是不会信的，作为科学家的其中一点特质就是，如果自己没有亲眼见证过，那就是不能信的。然后就可以去宇宙边界了，跟人类一起看着宇宙边缘的nothingness（和DW crossover），研究时间空间关系，研究时间is fluid——天使拥有这些各种各样的技能只会想到动用它们，而人类会想要知道为什么，虽然我不是疯子科学家，但确实也是非常好奇想要搞明白这些问题呢。所以要是能有只天使被关在我家地下室，也真是很难说能不能抗拒得了这样的tempt不对他下手做点研究。

除了听觉还有各种别的感官也都是超人的，最简单的这集还提到的另一点是可以用嗅觉发现人体非常精细的生理变化，比如近期得过的一些病症。传闻说狗狗都能闻出癌症病人，同样是利用了嗅觉，科学层面倒也是非常一致的理论了。于是扩展一下又能让Cas被疯子生物学家、医学家抓去研究了，美其名曰为了医学事业发展的必要牺牲，想要研究出他是怎么做到发现癌症的，大概率就要动用一些开颅之类的折磨手段让Cas战损一下了，不过好在没什么是天使不能自愈的。哦然后当然自愈能力也是要被继续拿来研究的，就算Cas答应可以治愈每一个研究员的重病的作为动机的亲人也没有用，人类总是那么贪婪，总是想要学会“渔”而不是只要“鱼”。同时是人类最大的优点和最糟糕的地方了。

### 35.【destiel&sastiel】S08E08 精神控制时的信任危机

被控制了又毫无记忆，被天堂监视了一举一动，被迫汇报两兄弟的行踪，变成天堂下派的大型摄像头监听器……这个设定一出来就已经看见虐了，怕不是Cas和Dean他们之间又要经历一次信任危机。只要故意只在他们三个之间或者只朝Cas透露一些假信息然后发现会被天堂发现，就会很容易认定他们中间有叛徒或者Cas变成天堂走狗之类的吧。Cas之前已经让他们失望过一次了，信任还没有重新建立起来，又要被当做一次背叛的话，再想要继续重建就更加难上加难了……Cas视角也会超级难过吧，这一次明明这么努力想要争取信任了，想要弥补之前的错误，但是好像仍然怎么做都是错的。要是逼急了怕不是又要做什么毁灭性大动作了。很希望这次他能在信任破裂之前先把记忆和精神控制权抢回来，带着两兄弟打上天堂把Naomi这伙人的阴谋解决了。

想到《纸钞屋》里Angel被认定成叛徒的那段剧情，被踢出警局时一个人悲伤地喝酒、醉驾然后出事。可以直接平行移接给现在这个精神控制状态下的Cas了。感觉愤怒状态下的Dean（可能也有Sam）会说出特别重特别伤人的话了，Cas会超级难过（但是好在他没那么脆弱），这个设定真的超级虐啊。

### 36.【destiel】DW911忏悔盘

（Cas=DW, Dean=Clara）

Cas以为Dean死了，自己被关进忏悔盘，一遍遍地死去，一遍遍地以自己为原料让下一个自己继续下去，直到wall被凿穿，“hell of a bird”，每次都是在最后时刻想起自己为什么在做这件事，为什么、为了谁在坚持下去，在想要放弃的时候总在头脑里听见Dean的声音。

OR

丁卡都在911的世界里，被unknown monster一圈圈地追逐一圈圈地一起逃跑，慢慢发现规律，但是每一次都要互相牺牲然后都没有记忆地重新开始，直到慢慢凿穿

### 37.【destiel】神灯精灵

阿拉丁AU

Dean捡到了一个神灯，擦三下冒出来的神灯精灵穿着件卡其色长风衣。他需要好好思考那三个愿望许什么。

（但是Cas当然会纵容他超过三个愿望的）

最后一个本来可以给自己的愿望留给放卡自由了

### 38.【destiel】海的女儿

小美人鱼卡，王子丁

要杀丁才能救自己，卡选择宁可自己化成泡沫

### 39.【destiel】S12E10 时间旅行的Dean遇上1901年的女体Cas（R级）

《傲慢与偏见》AU，DW的刀河代

Dean被time travel到误入1901时间线遇到了美女Cas，而这时候的Cas还不认识他。按照Dean看见美人就移不开眼睛的脾气，可以安排傲慢与偏见AU，来一步步靠近、撩卡，直到追到手。Cas一开始可能只是想借机观察学习一下人类，一步步沦陷。后续可以迅速热辣起来了，安排一下拿非利人的孕育而天使不是father。可以加一个设定受孕的天使被孩子的魔法束缚无法（也硬不下心）离开皮囊，所以暂时被更长久地困在这个皮囊和这条时间线了。（比起正剧里每次get laid都被坑的遭遇，Cas的初次是跟Dean的话反而可能是件好事。）

time travel这个梗还有一个很好的地方是，两个人的记忆顺序就会相反。要是这样发生过了，那么S04E01再重逢的时候意味就完全不一样了，Dean还什么都不知道而Cas知道他是他孩子的父亲，去地狱救人的奋不顾身也很容易解释了，deeper bond也同样。（非常美味也更有宿命感了）

想看S04E01和S12E10之间的某个地方Cas突然没忍住说漏了嘴。Dean：“等一下，等等等等。再来一遍，我是你孩子——我们的孩子——的father？Awesome!”（single mother带娃剧情也可以安排，被迫守口如瓶的卡咪可太不容易了）

或者S05E03妓院之前那段就会变成，Dean：“你从来没有过？”Cas：“倒也不是……”Dean：？好奇。Cas：拼命忍住不能告诉他（不然可能会破坏时间线什么的，或者他不能确定Dean提前知道了的话会不会对他有异样感觉，说不定S12E10的事就不会发生了，这段时间线就会被抹掉了，他不能忍受自己的孩子出现过又被undo了）

不过时间线就不能细究，不然到2017（S12时间线），孩子已经100多岁了，Dean刚三四十。那可能就会有点虐了，如果拿非利人的寿命跟人类接近，那很可能在正常时间线的Dean出生之前孩子可能就已经去世或者至少很老了。在前三季Cas还没来见Dean之前如果正好是孩子快要垂垂老矣的时候凭自己用人类的非魔法的方式找到了Dean，也不肯说他是谁（Cas千叮咛万嘱咐的），见了亲爹一面什么也没说就默默走了。到S12E10发生完了之后Dean回到正常时间线后知后觉想起来了去找孩子的墓……完了有点虐了。（算了要不就不安排孩子了）

天使的生殖系统也许跟人类也不太一样……？受孕方是人类的话会正常地怀胎分娩，但是天使的话（虽然用的仍然是人类vessel，需要设定一下vessel里面没有另一个人类灵魂），也许会有其他途径。不过人类皮囊时候理应也能怀孕分娩，除非像吸血鬼设定一样在天使占据期间身体会停止变化（解释了为什么不用刮胡子上厕所这些），但是仍然可以进食喝水喝酒，如果不是靠消化系统的话……那些食物分子只能是一进入身体系统就被天使力分解成分子不存在了。那么这样的话可能就也不能受孕……或者至少这是Cas以为的，所以意外发现居然怀了的时候可以想象他会有多惊讶。（显然天使完全没有“保护措施”的概念）

Cas是女性皮囊时Dean的性向女，是男性皮囊时形象男，突然理解了流动性向——跟人有关，跟身体性别无关。

比起孩子的问题，到S04E01加上之后在一起的那么久，终于见到了初恋而且还夺走innocence的那个人，Cas竟然能忍这这么久都没有暴露任何欲求……也是很令人钦佩。倒也可以顺手把S05E14的famine那段安排进来了，压抑的欲望可以合理释放一下（主线好像全都穿起来了）。

也想看Cas遵守本心强取属于自己的“所有物”的样子，充满占有欲保护欲的Cas（Cas：“I need you, Dean. It has to be you.” S08E10被洗脑控制了的Cas暴揍Dean时候说的，本能的那些need强于洗脑的部分），或者在Dean不知情地撩别的女孩子时候的吃醋Cas，很可爱。

Dean：突然想起来了Cas是这么强大美丽光芒四射的天使

（Chrysler Building那么大的天使，变成怀里香香软软的女孩子，非常反差萌）

总是会想象doi的时候coming的Cas会控制不住地发光，Dean非常in awe地看着他：“Awesome.”

Dean：“Holy smokes... my dick just did that?”

Cas发现怀了之后，Dean：“I didn't know it's possible.”Cas：“Neither did I.”（你们天堂是不是应该补一下性教育）

### **41.【destiel】唇上的诅咒《I Swear on Castiel's name》**【WIP】

（梗源童话镇317）

Dean的唇被上了魔法诅咒（多半是Rowena干的），亲吻就会让Cas失去天使力。Dean快要溺死了，Cas就算失去能力也会吻他渡一口空气。

被救的Dean：What have you done?

Cas：和失去你相比，失去我的grace不算什么。

（唇是怎么被诅咒的：Dean因为做错了一件什么事或者被迫做一个坏的选择而心怀愧疚，被质疑是否还有爱的能力，如果有的话就以他们的名字发誓。Dean：I swear on Castiel's name.）

could be Cas being the one cursed (Killian=Cas, Emma=Dean), Dean's been wanting to kiss him but doesn't allow himself to. Cas is cursed by witch that his lips will kill Dean, Cas stays away, but also doesn't think it's a problem, Dean won't kiss him anyway. Dean gets annoyed by Cas staying away, cornered him, Cas confessed, Dean fluttered/more annoyed. try to fix it but can't find solution yet, both get pushed by bad witch to drown Cas, Dean doesn't hesitate to kiss Cas to bring him back, choose Cas over himself

who cursed them: could be s4 Alastair or S5 Lucifer when he's too weak, both doesn't have enough power to get rid of Cas so doesn't mind to use nasty trick to let Dean takes out Cas; s6 Raphael when fighting with Cas, play dirty, want to take out the rival for Heaven civil war; s8 Metatron right before canon taking Cas's grace away, just nasty angel wanting more drama story to watch, fit into s9 beginning when Cas become human; s10 Rowena wants to take down Cas because want to enjoy the show between them; s15 Chuck because he wants enjoy the show between them

Outline:

S8E21 timeline canon divergent, they find Metatron, ask for help. Metatron doesn't care about trials or Heaven/Hell, refuses to help. Instead, he's read all spn books by Chuck "Carver Edlund" and intrigued by destiel. He tricks Dean into saying he swears on Castiel's name (do you still believe in love, then swear on the person you love the most to prove you still know what love is, Dean's threatened bc desperate to save Sam? want to swear on Sam but Metatron points out he's lying to himself bc that's responsibility), curses Dean's lips just to see a good story, and threatens Dean if he doesn't kiss Cas, Sam dies; if he does, Cas loses his grace; and the curse can't be reversed or interfered by angel power, or Dean dies. 

Dean's devastated, more repressed to keep himself away from Cas, disguise as anger on Cas even after Cas comes back to bunker after loses angel tablet (gut open by Naomi/Crowley), Cas gets pushed away by Dean's pride and anger, but Dean regrets immediately when Cas's almost pushed to leave, Dean apologizes and goes soft and asks Cas to stay, confesses the curse. they'll research on reversing the curse but lower priority than finding ways to save Sam, Cas agrees to help, but also very hesitantly express he's fine to lose his power if it saves Sam, Dean refuses, Cas mistakes as Dean doesn't want them kiss, Dean knows he misunderstand but can't correct him, more torn apart. both self-torturing and painfully mistaken

Metatron annoyed at their slow pace, push them, drown Dean, Cas is forced to make choice, he kisses Dean to save him, loses his power to Metatron. Dean wakes up, more guilty and furious, "What have you don", finds Cas human now, promise they'll figure out how to fix him, but they'll stop Metatron and save Sam first

"Do you really think I'll let you die? I'll choose myself over you?" "I wasn't sure." "Now you do. Comparing to losing you, the pain of losing my grace is negligible"

### 42.【destiel/Cas】S12E15-19 发生了什么

S12E15结尾Cas决定回天堂了，Dean不管怎么打电话都打不通全自动转入语音信箱，S12E19开头突然重新出现在bunker偷colt准备执行Joshua的计划去杀Kelly，这期间在天堂发生了什么？他回天堂一定不会受到什么好眼色看。会一声不响回到自己那间破旧的小屋吗，只有一张单人床和乱糟糟的被褥？但是就算被别的天使羞辱也一心想着只要自己这样容忍下来Dean就不用被迫做出艰难选择而坚持下来了。

Dean被米迦勒附身之后展开了大翅膀，跟S04E01的卡第一次展开翅膀时候一样壮观美丽，还有慢动作的慢慢展开的镜头。很想看丁卡都有翅膀前提下的初见和恋爱剧情，卡一开始不知道Dean也有翅膀，看见居然是比自己更加美丽强大的翅膀时突然梗住被震撼。

### ~~47.【destiel】S14E18 心碎杀死天使（《I'm Sorry》里用了）~~

（仿魔戒设定“杀死精灵的两件东西：心碎和火”）

天使刃和圣火可以把天使送去虚无，而心碎，可以彻底毁灭一个天使。

Dean的“you're dead to me”，可以真正地杀死Cas。

### **48.【destiel】S15E09 Monster Ending**

该隐之印让Cas发疯，Dean不得不把他关到Ma'lak Box里。

想写Cas发疯的时候发生了什么，可以用到S10E22上一次Dean有该隐之印的时候暴揍Cas的那一顿作为参考，Cas会黑化失控，但是会做到什么地步。会家暴Dean，这是肯定要有的，也许差点杀掉了他。但是最后是怎么被连哄带劝地关进Ma'lak Box的。

### 49.【destiel】《I'm Sorry》的后续

失忆卡（重置回遇到丁以前）x 1519后的丁

“没有人能比过去的我更爱你，现在的我也不行”

（灵感部分参考柠檬的《幻痛》和五觉）

### ~~50.【destiel】1518 fix-it《The Empty》【done】~~

丁后悔，疯狂努力要救回卡

Jack：我知道他只有在真正快乐的时候才会被虚无带走，我很高兴至少在他走之前你给了他他最想要的。你亲吻他了吗？

丁（震惊）：什么？

米：告诉我你至少给了他拥抱。

丁：（更震惊难过，taken back，speechless说不出话）

Jack/米：（也震惊）所以你什么都没有给他？那他怎么……？

丁：（痛苦后悔）

丁在1520死之前一直在想卡的时候，念念不忘，然后像1520一样死了，但是死之后上不了天堂，灵魂变成鬼魂，因为有unfinished business，卡就是他的unfinished business。为了让丁灵魂解放，米召唤Jack/new God（或者这个很早就试过了），但是Jack也做不到，虚无独立于上帝力量之外。丁无望地痛苦，感觉内心有缺失空洞，空洞越来越大，然后因为内心的空洞就是一种empty，所以他的灵魂也进入Empty了（文字游戏）。在虚无里见到卡，唤醒卡（可能卡本来就没睡），回应卡的感情，于是虚无不再虚无，内心被填满，用情感充满了虚无，于是让他们俩不再虚无，虚无也就对他们没有掌控能力了，所以他们得以一起逃脱虚无（简单俗气地说就是用爱打败了反派）。回来以后卡重新变成天使，丁灵魂上天堂，俩人在天堂重逢继续快乐生活。（卡也许也会提议让丁再次复活，但是丁可能拒绝了，地球反正还会有卡和米保护的，他想要休息了，he earned it）

1323丁想要的退休海边生活他说过这是他earn的但是从来没得到过，也许可以作为这里的结局

### 51.【destiel】slave Cas

（灵感来自《夜雨与晨曦》+TCW中slave Anakin/Ahsoka那集+飓风营救）

人类卡？或者单纯因为sigil能力被压制的卡，跟丁一起潜入地下孩童贩卖的拍卖会，卡先进去，丁假装成买家，说好了要先救孩子，结果发现卡被抓了，作为压轴被拍卖，丁要在救卡和救孩子们之间做选择

### 53.【destiel】《Forgiven》（Lyrics）

（by Within Temptation）

Couldn't save you from the start

Love you so it hurts my soul

Can you forgive me for trying again

Your silence makes me hold my breath

Oh time has passed you by

<br>

You were looking for the great escape

To chase your demons away

You couldn't face the freedom on your own

And here I am left in silence

### 54.【destiel】《Bye Bye Beautiful》（Lyrics）

（by Nightwish）

They used to love having so much to lose

Blink your eyes just once and see everything in ruins

Did you ever hear what I told you?

Did you ever read what I wrote you?

Did you ever listen to what we played?

Did you ever let in what the world said?

Did we get this far just to feel your hate?

Did we play to become only pawns in the game?

How blind can you be, don't you see?

You chose the long road but we'll be waiting

I need to die to feel alive

### 55.【destiel】《Stairway to The Skies》（Lyrics）

（by Within Temptation）

Seven seconds till the rise

Can't believe I'm still alive

And heaven was waiting for me

I thought this would be the end

But I know you'll understand

All that is keeping me here

I dream of a stairway to the skies

My angel is coming down from heaven to take me

I reach out but then you fade away

Whenever you call for me

Know that I'm only one step behind

I'm torn and the hate's still aching

Is it a curse or a virtue?

Have I been blinded by regret?

Perdition awaits my soul is at stake

Will I find a stairway to the skies

In the end?

### 56.【destiel】爱情蔑视死亡，悲哀奔赴死亡

“复仇战胜死亡，爱情蔑视死亡，荣誉渴望死亡，悲哀奔赴死亡，忧惧抢占死亡。”——《培根随笔》

（原梗是亚梅梗36，也很适合丁卡，1518的卡&1520的丁）

### 57.【destiel】西部世界AU

（AL梗17，直接可以搬过来用）

### 58.【destiel】S02E07《Date》

Dean: "My name is Dean Winchester. I'm an Aquarius. I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach, and frisky women"

### 59.【destiel】S04E02 sleep-watching

《sleep-watching kink》

《What if everything happened in the next 12 years is a long dream》

《You should show me some respect》

### 60.【destiel】S04E03 allergic to straight answer

《Angel is my shotgun》

《Allergic to straight answers》

### 61.【destiel】S04E06 coward Dean

when coward Dean met Cas

### 62.【destiel】S04E10 junkless

《Angels are all powerful and perfect》

Dean: “angels are junkless down there, like a Ken doll” <- How did you know

Cas -> first time fight in front of Dean and failed

### 63.【Cas】why can't him remember being on earth

“angel walking the earth for the first time in 2000 years” because every time he did, the memory is wiped (confirmed by Naomi in ~S08E19)

### 64.【destiel】S05E18 "last person look at me like that, I got laid"（R级）

Dean: “Cas, not for nothing, but the last person who looked at me like that…I got laid.”

Cas's fierce look is hot

a thought: what if that "last person" is S05E04 2014!Cas, 2014!Cas gives Dean a wink the second he goes into his tent, and here Dean gives Cas a wink back as if answering that one, we know pretty certain 2014!Dean&Cas have sexual relationship, and here Dean's almost confirming he's also involved when he's then/there, so 3p has happened

so ever since Dean comes back to current timeline to his current Cas, the first thing he did is to put his hand on Cas's shoulder, cuz he can't help touching him knowing what's that feel like. but he's also too coward to really say it to his real Cas, so for 12 years the only thing he has in head is that one night's memory, and every time he has to stroke himself off he uses that memory. He wants Cas know but he also fears Cas know.

Cas can read mind, so he actually knows what happened and that Dean's been thinking about that with him, a lot, like every time Dean stares at his lips when speaking, but Cas doesn't quite understand and it's too human, so he doesn't react. And he knows how much Dean doesn't like being mindread, so he pretends he never know, even though he always relive that every time Dean rethinks about that when he's in the room.

### 65.【Cas】S05E22 get Sam out of Cage

How did Cas get Sam out of the Cage, how did he handle Lucifer/Michael/Adam, how to explain to Adam he has to leave him behind, how he decide to leave Sam's soul behind

### 66.【Cas】S06E15 find weapons

How Bal & Cas finally find/get weapons while keep an eye on Sam/Dean

### 67.【destiel】S06E17 accidental come out by Bal

Bal: “You have me confused with the other angel - you know, the one in the dirty trenchcoat who's in love with you.” Bal knows how much Cas love Dean and this is his effort to help Cas open up/confess/come out.

How Bal find out, or Cas confessed to him and made him promise not to tell anyone, but of course Bal won't keep the promise seeing how much the unspoken love tortured him, just to help his good buddy out. Dean gets serious (or not), Cas gets furious about Bal.

### 68.【Cas】S06E20 《Don't step on the fish》

《Don't step on that fish》：I remember being at a shoreline, watching a little grey fish heave itself up on the beach and an older brother saying, "don't step on that fish, Castiel. Big plans for that fish."

《Tower of Babel》：I remember the Tower of Babel...All 37 feet of it, which I suppose was impressive at the time. And when it fell, they howled 'divine wrath'. But come on - dried dung can only be stacked so high.

I remember Cain and Abel... David and Goliath... Sodom and Gomorrah.

(mentioned a little in prompt 26.1)

### 69.【destiel】S07E17 Emmanuel hears something

Emmanuel (amnesia Cas) can hear longing/prayer but doesn't know what it is until he meets Dean.

(old reddit prompt about someone who thinks they're just imagining the voice until one day they hear "turn around" and see the other person)

Emmanuel can hear Heaven's talking like S4 Anna and knows about Dean/Sam but doesn't know what he's hearing is angel radio, meet Dean for the first time and realize (≈ S4 Anna/Dean but S7 amnesia Cas)

### ~~70.【destiel】When the first pie is made【done】~~

《Best creation ever》

Cas time travels with Dean to when the first pie is made

~like DW10&Rose in Rome

### 71.【destiel】Phantom Opera AU

Cas doesn't want Dean see his true face because he thinks he's ugly

(not very canon, Cas is actually proud of his true form, he's a little ego to brag about his height before and he still thinks angels are more superior than human after all these years)

### 72.【destiel】S09E06《Chinese Chair》（R级）

reel gag Dean: “If she has a Chinese Chair, you call me”

### **73.【destiel】《Dean Winchester is a Squirrel》Ice Age AU**

《Dean Winchester is a squirrel》

Dean is (transformed to) a squirrel, Sam a moose, Cas a bird, all in the Ice Age

multiverse version?

who did this? Crowley/Gabriel/Chuck/Rowena?

≈151

### **74.【destiel】S06E20《Superman》**

"Superman turns dark" "better start stocking kryptonite"

destiel watch "Batman vs Superman" movie together

Dean loves to make analogy of himself with Batman, quotes from BvS about "God/Angel", who has the right to decide who gets to live, a little argument/debate in the living room?, destiel having similar Lois/Clark debate, Dean/Lois: "I know it will never work" (established relationship?), Cas: "I'm not leaving, just need some space"

(relationship drama? potential crossover/fusion?)

more quotes: "- You're not even from this world. - You're my world." "The Devil doesn't come from below, it comes from above" "Man fights God" "- I love you. - Please. Don't." (confession before farewell)

more parallel: Cas/Superman has flaring eyes, iron-like body, no weakness but one, conflicted about morality, confused in human life

Batman/Superman similarity: dual identity

### 74.5【destiel】S06E20《Justice League》

BvS Superman doesn't turn bad, Justice League Superman turns evil

Dean didn't want to watch that, not remind them the time Cas turns bad, Cas wants to watch, understand their feelings at the time (establish relationship?), Cas apologizes, Dean already forgive him long ago

### 74.6【destiel】angel-killing weapons

inspired by BvS

Batman creates bullets with kryptonite, make kryptonite gas bomb to immobilize Superman

Dean/apocalypse world soldiers gets inspiration, make angel-killing bullets/gas bomb/etc.

### 75.【destiel】S08E12《Angel feather in the trunk》

Henry stole the angel feather in the trunk

where is that angel feather come from in the first place

### 76.【destiel】S08E12《A pinch of sand of time》

ingredients for time travel include: a pinch of sand of time

so time is sand, use it for S05E13 when Cas is badly wounded and passed out from time travel (see prompt 8)

### 77.【destiel】S08E17 sober during brainwash session

Cas's brainwash testing session, having to kill Dean over and over again to convince Naomi in order to get away, what if he's all the time sober and know what he's doing, he can tell the difference but still painful, but can't show any sign, which makes it even worse and more difficult to bear. Surrender to the brainwash could make it easier to bear, but he can't do that.

Why Cas can tell the difference: true Dean has brightest soul, fake/mimic Dean has no soul, Cas can see the soul and never mistake one from another, see the soul not the face, that's why relatively easy to kill to deceive Naomi and resist when being ordered to kill real Dean

(loophole: if Cas can see soul, then S6 no need to touch inside Sam to know he's soulless, unless that's Cas straight lying to their faces again)

### 78.【Cas】S08E21《First borns in Egypt》

Naomi: “There was that day, back in Egypt, not so long ago, where we slew every first-born infant whose door wasn't splashed with lamb's blood. And that was just PR.”

Cas: “I wasn't there.”

Naomi: “You were there. You just don't remember it.”

How Cas secretly saved some first borns, hide and protect them from rest of angels. How Cas get all his memory back after S15E20.

(≈ prompt 345)

### 79.【destiel】S08E23 what if Metatron is not lying

what if Metatron is not lying, Cas shut heaven's door and locked himself upstairs, tortured and almost killed by the angry angels, and the gang fight continued upstairs, then what? Dean knows nothing about Cas' situation, but eventually he had to know and had to help. Maybe after Cas is dying or dead again.

what if Sam also refused to let go and continue the trial and successfully shut the hell's door. Then what? Where is Sam, heaven or hell or veil?

Where does that leave Dean? All alone, losing Sam and Cas at the same time. Lisa is not an option, Bobby is dead. He's really alone this time.

### 80.【destiel】S09E03 What if April is just a human

What if April is really just a sweet little girl, not a reaper, and Cas didn't take protection: child-raising story for mortal Cas?

or the reaper possessed April got killed but the human April survived and pregnant

Nine months later Cas finds out. (squash timeline a bit) Dean killed Jack (which was evil) but Nephilim warning siren in Heaven is not off cuz there is a second one still running around. Cas' kid is born. What are they gonna do about it? How to raise the kid together? Something has to happen to the mother so the kid is fully Cas' (and Winchesters') custody. Raising a kid in bunker.

(check real timeline: S09E03 is Oct.22 2013, due date around July 15 2014, right between S09E23 and S10E01, demon Dean time -> patch: Cas didn't realize it until S12E23 Jack is born and killed on sight after birth immediately (time: May 18 2017), Cas' kid is 3y old, maybe overgrow a bit too like Jack did, show as a teen

### **81.【Dean/impala】S11E04 impala is a lady**（R级）

《Hunter's Baby》

impala becomes a real lady (=Tardis becomes a girl, DW S06E04)

Dean try to figure out who she is and where is his car, Dean had sex with her? "All the time you're in me, how is this different now?"

≈ prompt 307, a variation

Queen's 《I'm in love with my car》as BGM

### 82.【Dean】What if Ben is Dean's own

What if Lisa lied and Ben *is* Dean's own. Post-621, they have no memory of Dean, but Ben is dying of natural mortal disease (for some reason angels aren't there or can't fix either, maybe during S9 when Cas is human?), need transplant, Dean is the only fit and he finds out

### 83.【destiel】Happy Prince AU

Wilde's Happy Prince AU

Prince=卡，Swallow=丁

Cas is the happy prince sculpture, can give up some part of his body to grant some wish to help people

everything comes for a price, a finger to save a poor woman, a hand for a family, eyes for something, heart for Dean because Dean said "I need you", nothing left for himself

Rewrite S10E17-S15E20 from Bobby's perspective, when he's locked away for helping Cas get into Heaven and burst Metatron out, what's happening in Heaven after that, Metatron did something, Lucifer did something, Darkness come once, Empty come once, Heaven is short of power, Bobby can hear everything but do nothing from Heaven't jail but relatively safe, talking with other angel inmates and guards? find a way to get out? witness Cas & Jack rebuild Heaven

demon Dean & angel Cas

both immortal

Dean murders the world, Cas has to be there watch, try to save the people *and* save Dean, but still wouldn't want to kill Dean

morally deprived Dean so he can be with Cas without burden, can more openly show his fondness and flirtation, and Cas indulges him

### 94.【drowley】S10E23 Crowley's love

(for some reason Rowena can't cast the spell, Crowley has to do it)

What if Crowley has to find the one he loved to cast the spell: find out to be Dean

### 94.5【Rowena/Crowley】S10E23 Rowena's love

the spell didn't work after Rowena killed Oskar, or there is just no Oskar in this version

for some reason she ended up killing Crowley, and the spell worked

Rowena actually truly loved Crowley but repressed it so much that herself didn't even know

### 95.【destiel】S10E23 Cas has to kill Dean to release MoC curse to save Dean

(similar as above, the spell requires a sacrifice of caster's love)

What if Cas has to cast the spell: he knows it's Dean, he will never kill him no matter what

What if we told him killing Dean and making him a demon again is the only way to let the spell work and save him, then he might would agree

### 99.【destiel】S11E11-23 Cas inside his brain

Cas's view when he's hidden in his brain (in bunker kitchen), doesn't know Lucifer is controling the body, doesn't notice the outside world but slowly realizes something is off (like Wandavision), slowly knows what's happening but chooses not to go back out.

### 100.【destiel】S05E04 Dean's dream

When Cas goes into Dean's dream trying to reach out to him to tell him something (like in S04E19), and finds out Dean is dreaming about S05E04 endverse Cas.

### 101.【destiel】《Misplaced Among The Angels》（Lyrics）

（by Avantasia）

He can take me away

I'm misplaced among the angels

Save me, I'm in need of you

When real life bleeds through

That frail veneer of reason

Bleeding away

Misplaced among the angels

I'm in need of you

When real life bleeds through

The dark beneath the frail veneer of reason



A sweet embrace, a dying dream

Craving lit up by belief

On the side of angels, dead in need

### 102.【destiel】《You Will Never be Our God》（Lyrics）

（by Xandria）

I've been in Hell for many years

And all the time is lost for me, for eternity

I try to take back what was mine

A prison they have made my mind, my enemy



"March in line", "The end of time"

You will never be our savior

I won't die terrorized

You will never be our god

No more hate disguised by grace



They tried to break my will to live

Another life where I can be

Can be myself



Why?

Is this the only way for us?

Turn your eyes away

But all the pain will stay

### 103.【destiel】《Wish I had an Angel》（Lyrics）

（by Nightwish）

I wish I had an angel

For one moment of love

I'm in love with my lust

Burning angelwings to dust



Deep into a dying day

I took a step outside an innocent heart

Prepare to hate me fall when I may

This night will hurt you like never before



Old loves they die hard

Old lies they die harder



Last dance, first kiss

Your touch my bliss

Beauty always comes with dark thoughts

### 109.【destiel】S11E23 what if God dies, soul bomb works

What if the original plan works out, Chuck dies, Dean triggers the soul bomb and takes Amara, how would the world go from there, Sam is shattered, Cas takes care of Sam, Dean's funeral with Black Sabbath, no ash but put tomb in the place he loved, life carry on

Without both God and Darkness, the world is still in balance and move on

Dean, after death, like Billie promised, Billie ensures he is in Empty where no one come back. Sam and Cas are devastated, like how Jack wants Cas back and wakes him, so is Cas' want and pray, powerful enough to wake Dean up in Empty. Cas would have checked Heaven (shut down by angels already) and look for Dean but can't find him.

Dean would bargain his way out of Empty like Cas did in 1305, or Cas would get suicidal and died and ended up in Empty too, and the already waken-up Dean find Cas in the Empty, bust both of them out.

doi come的时候卡脱口而出（以诺语？）说的是各种random words，一次是jellyfish，另一次是（）（忘了，另一个词，也是类似组成结构的美丽事物，starlight? starfish? something old and beautiful and bright），丁刨根问底想知道出处是怎么来的

为了找答案假装不经意地去水世界（顺便是案子？）看水母，最后刨出答案是这是ancient and beautiful的事物，算是卡给丁的昵称（丁：感动，但是，jellyfish? seriously?）（又一个卡的otherworldly表现，丁likes it, regardless of complaints）

guilty/self-blaming Dean, comforting Cas

Another time when Dean feels guilty about jump started Apocalypse, Cas finds the perfect rebuttal reasoning: just check the Apocalypse world, the Apocalypse will start with or without Dean, but it will not end without him. So stop the self-blame.

### 123.【destiel】human Cas' first Christmas

（源自童年记忆的圣诞礼物）

人类卡的第一次圣诞，丁给卡床脚准备了圣诞礼物，坚称圣诞老人是真的，卡本来很确定圣诞老人不存在，但是丁看起来太认真了他真的有点动摇然后信了

丁：Santa Claus is real only when you're a human

卡：Even if it's true, thought he's only for kid

丁：He can't tell the difference between new (angel-turned) human and kid, both only been human for couple years

哪怕后来卡知道了这是玩笑也仍然最爱这个圣诞礼物（时间线可以从s5开始拉到s9再到s15），非常温暖可爱的回忆

### 124.【destiel】松果

（来自生活）

Cas grows into habit of bringing back a pine cone every time he goes for a walk in the woods (or when walk the dog Miracle). He says because they're beautiful, and smells like oil. Like a squirrel. So cute and adorable Dean can't stand. Dean fake whines and complains but actually it's just too much adorability he doesn't know how to handle. (post-1520)

### 125.【destiel】"Please come pick up your boyfriend"

("Why always me making the call""He's your boyfriend")

Every time Dean is sulky and miserable, Sam prays for Cas to take him away for a while, go somewhere, like humans do to take a walk to take mind off (until Dean starts to find pattern and protests, and the said sulkiness is related to Cas)

(prompt comes when half-way reading "When Charlie met Cas" and/or "Put up your Dukes", or basically any story about Dean being Dean and can't take his head out of his ass and being totally emotionally constipated)

### 126.【destiel】《Dorky or not dorky》

Cas sometimes pretends to be dorky and misunderstands references even if he understands, to make Dean laugh, because he knows he likes it and enjoyes being mocked by him when he looks at him with smile

### 127.【destiel】《A Case at A Time》

"A Case at A Time": could be a AO3 new series name

short stories, dailies, TFW日常，可以按照梗表往下写

句式模仿"one day at a time", "one hour at a time"

### 128.【destiel】5维空间（星际穿越观影体）

TFW watch *Interstellar* (real time: 2014/10/5, after S10E05)

Cas comments on 5D explanation: "5D visualiztion is actually quite accurate, but not what happened in black hole" then talk about physics equations, Sam follows, Dean: "English please", Cas: "Easier if I just show you"

relative prompt: "The feeling of being watched is your dying self look back on your life", in 5D plane Cas accompanies Dean to witness his whole life and all possibilities (Dean: "like a scientific way to explain to me God and destiny is not supernatural"), Cas is there with Dean in every important moment, even and especially the last. Regardless of how Dean dies, in all these scenarios Cas is with him (including the actual one in S15E20)

Real timeline comes to S15E18: Dean painful: "It's not supposed to be like this" he's supposed to die before Cas and not alone, Cas is not supposed to die, Cas post-confess smile: "It only means one thing - I'll come back to you, one way or another, don't lose hope, but for now, goodbye" and then S15E20 Cas does come back and does witness Dean's actual dying moment, and in that moment, revisit his whole life again, and meets the younger themselves in the 5D plane (need前面铺垫) and solves the confusion. The circle completes. The equation is solved. The universe is harmonious. Dean Winchester stops breathing.

(They will reunite in Heaven later, of course. But probably no chance to see the universe from there, the perk only belongs to angel or human when they are on Earth. Don't forget Cas is "multidimensional" celestrial being, has to make use of the "multi-dimensionality" (physics) and the "celestrial-ity" (astronomy).)

### 129.【destiel】Supernatural is not super-natural

Everything is actually - *natural*. Why are they called "supernatural". It's like science and technology are called magic back in history.

(prompt comes half way writing prompt 128) Destiny and possibilities lie within 5D plane, the choices and life trajectory is in different dimension and that is physics, so that is nature. Everything else is actually quite natural. Why is werewolf considered less natural than wolf? Monsters are part of the nature. Maybe the most un-natural super-natural thing is human.

Cas explains theory of evolution? He witnesses the first fish and homo sapiens and Neanderthals, but also Noah's Ark and Tower of Babel, how do those combine together in human history? Winchesters ask questions, Cas answers, like a natural history class.

(include examples when debating with friends: koala, female hyena)(conversation heavy, could be triggered when watching nature channel)

### 130.【destiel】Time is fluid 刀河梗【WIP】

(inspired from S04E03/S05E13 "Time is fluid", AO3 story "A turn of the earth", DW刀河梗, recent "Agatha All Along"S01E07, Benjamin Burton)

Cas can't control where to land in time stream (a curse?), has to pop in time in reverse order, remember things in reverse order with Dean but still manages to fall in love. Both keeps journal to keep up, always run short in time.

"The First time I meet you is the last time you meet me"

"You'll see me again, but I'll never see you again"

401 Dean meets 1518 Cas, 1518 Dean meets 401 Cas

Cas moving backwards, remember him less by every time they met, Dean more

"Why do you act like it's our first kiss" (heartbroken to know it's the last for her)

"What you said to Amy, there's a worse day coming for you?" "When I first met the Doctor, a long, long time ago, he knew all about me. Think about that. Impressionable young girl and suddenly, this man just drops out of the sky. And he's clever and mad and wonderful and knows every last thing about her. Imagine what that does to a girl. Trouble is it's all back-to-front. My past is his future. We're traveling in opposite directions. Every time we meet, I know him more, he knows me less. **I live for the days when I see him**, but I know that every time I do, he'll be one step further away. And the day is coming when I'll look into that man's eyes, my Doctor, and he won't have the faintest idea who I am. And I think it's going to kill me." (S06E01)

keeps delay going to the last place he knows will be their last; has 10 years to think about how to fix this, why would he give him (something) → eventually saved his life

### 131.【destiel】wear a bell（R级?）

Cas keeps randomly popping in and scares them, Dean makes him new rule: can't fly in within X feet (like a block away, a corridor away), has to walk the rest of the way to them like humans do, either that or Cas wearing a bell (Cas rolls his eyes) (but which one he'll choose? bell becomes punishment when he fails the first rule? sexual punishment?)

### ~~132.【destiel】S13E04/S15E18 睡觉恐惧【done】~~

《Fear of Sleep》

tag: angst, HE, S15E18, canon divergent, pos

因为在虚无中入睡就代表永远醒不过来，回不到丁身边，所以就算回来了，就算到后来真的需要睡眠（私设1520回来之后），不管多困多累，卡也不敢睡

安静的深夜，不敢睡觉的时候，会怎么做，失眠看书听音乐喝咖啡

私设一开始还是天使时期（1304-1520），倒也可以不睡；后期是人类时期了，硬撑着不睡，像疯米时期一样快把自己搞疯了，不得不睡着了，每次都会惊慌，丁怎么把他哄好，怎么给他安全感

一起睡，闪回曾经是卡翅膀mantle丁让他不做噩梦，现在是丁这样让卡能安心（在一起了？不重要）

### 133.【destiel】S13E05 Right in time for funeral

After Empty, Cas comes to Earth right in time for S15E20 Dean's funeral

(≈ prompt 318)

### 134.【destiel】S13E07 “我也想见你，越快越好”

Cas: “I would like to see you too, the sooner the better”

丁来不及回应，卡的电话就被路西抢走挂断了，卡自己也被抓走了，等到回来以后都以为两个人都忘了，其实丁没忘，等到两个人终于又有时间单独相处的时候丁问起来了，卡脸红，说不定这时候就能戳破窗户纸了，不过有可能丁下意识又会后退否认自己的内心，两个人的感情又要拉扯一会儿才能袒露

### ~~135.【destiel】S13E12 "I'm in love"【done】~~

《Dean Winchester Says He's in Love》

Dean中两个小女巫的爱情魔咒的时候Cas正好刚从Asmodeus地方出来，回到bunker时候看见的是Dean陷入爱情的样子，就认为他对自己的样子不是爱情的样子，更加压抑自己的感情了，说不定也会有点酸？而Dean脱离魔咒之后反而意识到了自己对卡其实就是爱情

Cas knows Dean is in Apocalypse world and rift is still open, why he stays behind for Gabe instead of going there after Dean.

Dean accuses him choosing angel over him afterwards, could be a big fight and/or cold war again.

### 141.【destiel】梦境=Matrix梗

（梗改编自2024-08-16梦记）

醒来=退出，类似Matrix，只有出来的人是得救的，温双一直不肯下线所以一直被困在里面，卡下线出来了以后才意识到活着的人才是被困在那个世界里的，想尽办法要给Matrix里的传消息想让温双出来，所以表现得好像是想用各种方法杀他们。自我牺牲的部分可能是因为外面世界有危险不得不主动下线但是又因为Matrix规则里可能有不能直接自杀的限制，只能用牺牲来代替自杀实现目的。

（可以把开局的卡写得好像反派，到后面揭晓反转）

（有点像djinn世界）

### 142.【samcifer/micifer】S13E22 天启世界的天堂

Sam在天启世界短暂死亡期间，在被吸血鬼杀死之后、被路西法复活之前，他在哪里？天堂还是vail？天启世界的天堂可能已经空了，所有（/大部分）天使都在地上参战。天堂的话，有没有可能遇见天启世界已经上天堂了的人（/天启世界没出现过的人），比如John、Ellen、Jo、Ash？（每个世界的天堂应该是不连通的）天启世界的Gabriel在哪里？劝天启世界的死骑帮忙参战？在天堂提前跟天启世界米迦勒打了照面然后正要被杀的时候被路西拉回来了？路西有没有personally跑到天堂去拉Sam？说不定也在那被米迦打了一顿，但是刚复活的Sam没有那段记忆所以不记得了。

### 143.【CasJimmy】S13E22 天启世界的黑卡

（出场集：1322，[wiki](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Castiel_(Apocalypse_World))；黑卡：German口音，左眼glassy blind，facial tic，dark suit & trench coat）

天启世界黑卡仍然用的是Jimmy的皮囊，这个版本的卡是torture高手（主世界其实也是），是怎么让Jimmy同意的？这个版本没经历过422所以Jimmy有没有死？黑卡被杀之前让Jimmy上身的话主世界卡是不是就会犹豫不杀他因为愧疚，所以自己陷入危险？

### 143.5【CasJimmy】S13E22 天启黑卡强迫附身Jimmy【WIP】

（以下梗源同体2479）

这是一个没有温家兄弟的世界，所以Cas来地球的目的不是为了救righteous man而是为了apocalypse战争做准备。这个世界的Jimmy设定没有变，但因为Cas目的变了，所以他们的磨合其实并不好。

Jimmy尝试反抗过很多次。Cas一开始会亲自警告他，后来有一次选择直接离开了Jimmy。Jimmy以为自己自由了，但他的身体已经被天使grace折磨得不太好了。他在逃跑途中被其他天使发现抓了回去，天使说这就是Castiel说的不听话的vessel啊，要不要我们帮Castiel解决这个麻烦呢。就开始折磨Jimmy

因为太痛苦了，Jimmy忍不住在想，Castiel会回来吗，对我需要惩罚到如此地步吗？我什么都给他了，难道连我的良知和思想，都要彻底交托么？Castiel你不会这样的吧？

本来也只是普通的折磨而已，在天使提出要不直接弄坏他的大脑，让他有说yes的意识但没有深度思考的能力的时候，Castiel还是回来了，而且还是穿着Claire回来的。他看了Jimmy一眼，把折磨Jimmy的天使都揍了一遍。但根本上还是觉得，其他天使无权为他决定Jimmy的任何事。

之后他把Jimmy带到了一个单独的废弃房间，让Jimmy休息。但Jimmy不愿意休息，只是反复观察Claire。Castiel说“这是你的女儿，我知道。我遇到她时她在战区边缘，受伤很严重。”过了一会儿补充，“我把她治好了。就算我离开，她也会继续活着。”只是没有任何意义，因为缺乏生存能力的人都会死——只不过他没说出口。

Claire的外套是烂的，看起来被战火轰炸过。但内衬姑且被恢复了一些，保留了一些体面，但Jimmy无法为此感到欣慰。

昏暗的房间内沉默了很久，Jimmy的思绪开始飘散。他开始思考这里在被战火波及之前是否曾是不错的旅店，现在这房间外又有多少天使，又或者这是Castiel的秘密基地外面并没有其他人——怎么可能呢，他早就知道Castiel不是他以为的那个独特的天使了，他是个冷血的士兵。他也不会想逃跑了，Castiel离开他的这么些天内他的神经从来没有停止过疼痛，他知道他跑不掉，也跑不远。

也许Castiel重新附身他就不会再疼了，他也不愿意让Castiel穿着他年幼的女儿上战场，可是他应当如何开口，如何邀请苦难和噩梦重新拥抱他？

无眠了一晚上，第二天Jimmy还是在Castiel来看他时说了，“用我，别用我的女儿。把我女儿放在安全的地方吧，我不会再质疑，更不会再反抗，我完全是你的了。”

Castiel把Claire带到了战区外的荒林里，重新转移到Jimmy身上。他确实也不想用一个年幼女孩的身体。而在他重新进入Jimmy的时候，Jimmy在想，他进来后我的神经确实不疼了。

之后就像是深度睡眠，偶尔Jimmy会被神经上音乐的疼痛惊醒，意识朦胧地看见自己身处各种险境，比如身体被撕碎，半边脑袋被炮火炸散。放在人类身上一定是会死的伤势，似乎也只够让天使的grace与他的意识短暂失调不到半秒。

偶尔他也想过反抗，想过趁乱挣扎，但又会有一瞬间犹豫：“如果不是我，那么Castiel下一个vessel会是谁”

但有时候又不一样，Castiel没有受伤，他只是……躺在一个像手术台一样的地方。Jimmy觉得不疼，他想站起来，但做不到。他摸摸脑袋，发现铁圈罩着他的额头，脑袋上都是深深浅浅的钉子。他的手在控制不住地颤抖。

随后他就被这个骇人的事实吓晕过去。晕过去的感觉像在坠落，他似乎在坠回谷底之前看见了Castiel，天使的意识被那些入脑的长钉固定，多余的羽毛被剪去，翅膀内测所剩无几的柔软绒羽寸寸枯萎，余下的每一根羽毛都像冷硬的金属片。

最后一次醒来是Castiel死的时候，Jimmy没弄清楚情况，只是随着Castiel的垂死意识越发清楚了。他感觉疼痛，不再是神经的疼痛而是无处不在，天使垂死不受控制的grace焚化了他的内脏，烧焦了他的眼球……但在死前他看到了穿着风衣的天使，他没有搞清楚情况，他只模糊地感觉到，“Castiel”在杀他。不过在某种意义上，他或许早就死了

最后一点意识是在虚无里，Jimmy在漫无边际的黑暗中行走，感觉不到疼痛也感觉不到任何情绪，或者说是被各种负面情绪压垮已经麻木到一种程度……走到某处他提到了一个睡在地上的人，这个人与他面容相同，胸口插着那把杀死他们的angel blade。Castiel半睁着眼睛看他，随后又无言地往上看去——Jimmy在他身边坐下抬头观望，灵魂的光点在无边无际的黑暗上方坠落，天堂和地狱早就在战争中摧毁，无处可去的灵魂尽数归于虚无。等Jimmy回过神时虚无的触手已经覆盖了他半身，而在他被黏腻阴沉的黑暗覆盖之前他往旁边看去，Castiel已经彻底沉没，不知所踪了。

### **144.【destiel】S13E23《Bunker never has angel warding》**

（某个时间点，天使/路西/Naomi/Metatron/Michael还是大威胁的时候）Sam想要给bunker加angel warding，Dean坚决不同意，说bunker也是卡的家，已经把卡赶出去过一次不能再这么干一次了，两个人争吵，卡其实在墙角听见了。卡再出现在bunker的时候表现虚弱，Dean问怎么了卡不肯说，其实偷偷在bunker画warding了，一边画一边擦嘴角血，被Dean抓住了一次，强制擦掉他正在画的那个，把卡抱出bunker，问他为什么这么干。卡在外面休息恢复，答不能因为他让他们陷入危险，bunker是地球上最安全的地方，是他们的家，Dean：也是你的家。

（看到S13E23路西米迦自由进出bunker想到）

### **145.【destiel/TFW】魂穿二代TFW同名三个小孩子**

Sam&Cas are brothers and Garth's kids, Dean is real Sam's kid, all three stuck in kids' bodies, probably because three kids get together in the future and messed up with some magic in some cases, the three of them (from past) have to figure out the situation, pretend to be the kids, while still being themselves

Dean & Cas still have the same mutual pining feelings

Dean: How come Sam is still the one with a big brother?

and Cas' turn to be in a family

(kid fic, fluffy?)

### 146.【destiel】S14E13 wish pearl: heart's deepest desire

Dean thought his biggest desire is Michael out of his head, but actually he desires Cas. The pearl gives him what he wants even if he doesn't know he wants.

### 147.【destiel】S12E19 "it's like herding a cat"

Dean: (要哄卡做什么事实在太难了) it's like herding a cat

Cas becomes a cat? actually herding a cat

### 153.【destiel】S10E17 language made of color

> Castiel: Because you can hear everyone's thoughts.

> Pryce: Well, not yours. All I'm getting from you is... colors. 

Cas' brain/thought is all color-based, because thought process or his language system (true enochian?) is made of color

### 154.【destiel】《Who Knew》（Lyrics）

（by Pink）

If someone said three years from now

You'd be long gone

I'd stand up and punch them out

'Cause they're all wrong

I know better 'cause you said forever, and ever

Who knew?

<br>

Remember when were were such fools

And so convinced and just too cool

I wish I could touch you again

I wish I could still call you a friend

I'd give anything

### 155.【destiel】S06E18 What if Bobby exploded

Cas is being careful but still not careful enough, Bobby exploded, Dean super pissed at Cas, what happens next?

### ~~156.【destiel】S06E18 What if boys get lost in western world【done】~~

Cas refused to risk Bobby (or even if used his power still not recovered enough to time travel, or Cas didn't wake up in time), Dean/Sam stays in town for more than 24h and lost to Cas, what happens next?

What happened in the time flux that prevents Cas from locating and reaching Dean however hard he fights for him, what's the consequence of that fight when he's already exhausted because of Rachael's stab? He's more wounded. Raphael is still at his tail, might follow him in the time flux too, fight across time and space and falls in random places.

What happened to the boys when they have to extend their stay in Sunrise, Wyoming, what dangers in there? Demons are still wandering around. They might work with Samuel Colt. They might leave message for their future self in the Pentagon railway so they would have noticed at end of S2, changed history slightly maybe?

### 159.【destiel】S07E17 Dean stays to take care of broken!Cas

Instead of Meg staying behind to take care of Cas, Dean stays. Demons and Leviathans will come, more of reason to stay behind for him.

（≈ prompt 201）

### 160.【destiel】S07E10《Blood》

Balthazar: “You need the blood of your father, but your father needn't be blood.”

Spell/magic has loose definition for father/blood, what other can non-blood blood be used to?

replace "father" with "brother", Dean considers Cas as brother, so for some spell that literally requires "blood of your brother", would that work? Official approval of really actually being "brother"/"family"?

### ~~161.【destiel】S06E05 Dean gets killed when he's still vampire 【done】~~

working title:《Red and Black》

Dean gets killed when he's still vampire so he goes directly to purgatory, fights the monsters, tries to come back but can't go through human portal

Cas goes desperate, blames himself, pushes Crowley/Alphas even further to find purgatory, finds rogue reaper Ajay, tries to go purgatory as angel but fail to leviathans, decide to go as monster, turns himself to monster (disturbing form, distorted wings etc.) with death wish, gets killed by soulless Sam as he wants, goes to purgatory, finds Dean. Both not recognize the other at first for a bit, but gradually grow trust and stay company, Dean realize souls can make Cas heal and stronger, so hunt together. Leviathans attack again and almost kill Cas, Dean hunt more souls and feed Cas by mouth to help him heal. Dean kiss him to wake him up. Cas confesses all secrets he's hiding this year, Dean pissed

Cas sees leviathans and everything, only way out is he juice up, so in order to bring Dean back, Cas absorbs souls in purgatory (tries best to avoid leviathans so stay sane mostly), blows up a hole in purgatory to push Dean out (heal him too, transform him back to human again), tries to stay behind to keep everything in purgatory not escape by using his body as patch to the hole (and guilty for leaving Sam's soul behind, self-punish)

Dean insists him out too or else he'll jump back in & they'll help fix Cas's leviathan problem, Cas complies finally, drooping leviathan ooze occasionally but mostly can hold them back, goes to hell, steals Sam's soul back and fixes him, fights Raphael with his leviathan part ("rock beats scissor, leviathan beats angel"), cancels out both problems (explodes, Dean freaks out, Cas survives), problem solved, world in peace again

### 162.【destiel】S08E02 "Too much hearts is always Castiel's problem"

Sammandriel: Too much hearts is always Castiel's problem

it's literal, Cas has too much hearts

his true form can be terrifying, disturbing

Dean amazed

### 163.【destiel】S09E01 Cas goes through trial to shut Hell's gate

Sam is just a human and almost finishes the trials. Cas becomes human, thinks he made big mistake and wants to make it up by going through the same three hell's trials again as Sam did to actually shut Hell's gate. Cas goes to look for Hell's hound and kills it alone, goes to hell and free Kevin/Ellen/Jo (?)'s soul to heaven, becomes very sick/weak like Sam was, goes back to bunker because they still has Crowley in the basement and it's his third trial. Cas doesn't care he'll die, only that he needs to make at least one thing right. Cas tries to comfort Dean he's been ok all these previous times and gets resurrected and this time will be the same, no one is better at "not keeping dead" than he was. Dean gets distracted to take care of sick Sam, Cas succeeds at third trial and hell's gate shuts, Cas gets dragged down. Dean has to crush open the gate to drag his ass back, because "we don't leave family behind".

### **164.【destiel】S09E03 Cas&April's kid become new Death (the horseman)《Reapers are dying (but my kid can help)》**

看903总算慢慢搞明白reaper还真是天使的一个分支（之前也怀疑是但是一直没太搞明白这件事），但是平时不在天上所以全体天使堕天时候没被影响到，能被天使刀杀掉或者折磨（或者被女巫干掉），被刀划了以后也是放白光，要在地球上显形也是跟别的正常天使一样需要附身人类而且要人类consent，但是职能汇报的顶头上司是死骑

然后如果变成rogue reaper的话干什么的都有，能变成赏金猎人for hire，能想去炼狱就去炼狱。但是，如果rogue reaper这种天使能随便上下炼狱，为什么正常天使不行

感觉好像，天使跟reaper是同一种prototype的生物分别分配给死骑和God了，本质是一样的，但是听命不一样，后续发展出来就会稍微有点不一样，但是这样的话，已知“死骑死了的情况下死掉的reaper会变成死骑”可得“God死了的情况下死掉的angel会变成God”，已知“God没死的情况下死掉的angel会去Empty”可得“死骑没死的情况下死掉的reaper大概率也是去Empty”，于是可得，卡在Empty也可能会碰到April……

继续已知“天使可以被驱逐咒pia飞、能被圣火和天使刀杀”和“reaper能被天使刀杀”可得“大概率reaper也可以被驱逐咒pia飞、能被圣火杀”。突然意识到，后期他们死了被reaper追着的时候，要把reaper干掉还是很容易的……

然后还有，已知“除了God没什么别的可以创造新的天使”可得“除了死骑没什么别的可以创造新的reaper”，已知“天使数量在卡变成God和一系列事故之后大幅下降”可得“reaper数量在整个系列里应该也是持续下降”

已知“Jack变成新God之后新捏了一些天使”，但是大结局之后没有新的死骑，所以reaper数量这是一直没得到补充，到大结局也没解决这个问题诶！既然God都已经是自己人顶上去干了，也应该加塞一个自己人去当死骑才对

已知“天使跟人类的孩子比天使能力强而且可以接近God程度”，推测“reaper跟人类的孩子比reaper能力强而且可以接近死骑程度”，然后唯一场上已知发生过的reaper跟人类的doi是April和卡，可得……如果卡和April的孩子出生了可以顶上新死骑的空缺……

天使和reaper都是SPN的消耗品……后面Rowena为了把死骑激怒来谈条件，还是连成片地屠reaper。无人关心，但是reaper真的在变少。天使恶魔至少大家了解那个系统，还可以知道怎么运作的，reaper和死骑这个系统，真是数量下降了也没人知道没人管。温双都没管，因为温双身边没关系足够好的reaper亲友！其实有一个帮过好几次忙的Tessa，但是后来天使内战时候也叛变去帮天使那边了，然后就被丁温捅死了

A story about Dean helps raise Cas's kid (given birth by April the reaper who gets killed by who?) and finds out the kid can fix a lot of problems and becomes the new reaper after Dean iced the previous Death. The kid will have near-Death power, how does the kid officially become Death? Absorb old Death's power? Needs to die? Dean/Cas have to kill him?

That kid might/should have good relationship with Jack, so new God and new Death are in good balance, same age, same family, same parenting. New creator of the new world, don't know who's older, tell others they may reap each other some day but Dean/Cas know that won't happen, they'll keep each other company.

(≈ prompt 180)

### 165.【destiel】S06E21 "In for a penny, in for a pound"

Balthazar's words, reuse it in casino setting? destiel was just having fun gambling? or another gambler case like S05E07

### 166.【crowstiel】S09E10 Crowley/Cas both human

after S09E01 Cas becomes human, Crowley gets addicted to human blood and kidnapped into the bunker, it's not impossible to continue inject him with purified human blood and after long enough he does get fully converted into pure human and ends up getting out the devil's trap by himself

want to see Crowley and Cas as two pure human hanging around hunting, still bickering a lot like they did in S09E10, kinda like two real hunters but still kinda like angel/demon, and of course at the end of the story they both regain their unearthly power and maybe has to fight again, but surely won't want to kill each other so much like they might do after S06E22

### 167.【destiel】S06E22 side affect of becoming God: amnesia

Chuck takes precaution for anyone closer to God's ability, as soon as Cas juice up and ganks Raphael, he forgets who he is and that he has God power. He flies away on instinct, not knowing why and how. He finds out he has power, probably uses a few to help people, freaks out a bit, Raphael's men hunt him down and get killed, takes long time but wanders back to bunker. (Then what?)

(A bit inspired by 《Heard from your mother》)

### 168.【gabstiel】S09E18 Gabe and porn and Cas（R级）

head canon ver of Cas was raised by Gabe from angel baby to adule seraph

Gabe loves sex and porn, Cas never sees porn until S06E10 and never has sex until S09E03, how does that happen

How does Gabe hide all from baby angel? prevent from being run into? embarrassed (or not?) and don't know how to explain or go ahead explain in plain words?

(might be a cute little kid-raising story, gabstiel pairing but no slash)

### 169.【all】S09E20 Godfather monster-version

Chicago, five monster families start gang fighting

Winchesters get pulled out of town because Cas finds leads on Metatron, and say they'll put other hunters in it, what hunter can possibly handle five big monster families?

TFW come back to clean up Chicago situation after things peace out (after S11E23 maybe?)

### 170.【destiel】S09E21 "commander"（R级）

Dean teases Cas "Commander" when his men call him that -> Dean call him commander on bed

also S09E22, Cas: "They like to hear me say their names", Dean: "I know a couple of women like that" -> Dean certainly likes that too and Cas is good at it

### 171.【destiel】S10E09 "throw me into the freakin' sun"

Dean: "Knife me, smite me, throw me into the freakin' sun, whatever. And don't let Sam get in the way, because he'll try. I can't go down that road again, man. I can't be that thing again."

What if after S10E22 Dean does go down that road and be that thing again and Cas has to keep his promise and try to kill him in all the ways he can think of, tried with knifing, smiting, throwing into the sun, but nothing works. The mark of Cain keeps Dean resurrected whatever Cas does, and every try kills Cas more than Dean, and Sam will always try to get in the way. Until Cas can't take anymore and want to give up, let Dean kill him instead so he won't have to watch. Dean gets his mind back before killing Cas, like how Cas fights brain wash in S08E17.

### 172.【destiel】S09E11 what if Cas gets Mark of Cain

what if the first time round, instead of Dean getting Mark of Cain, Cas gets it instead

borrow something from S15 Cas gets mark (briefly) and Chuck's what-if future of "Cas gets crazy and Dean has to lock him up in Malaak Box"

### 173.【destiel】found missing wings before found angel

（来自路西剧）

Dean在沙滩上发现一对硬生生撕下来的烧焦黑色翅膀，第一反应觉得是路西的，后来发现是卡的，一开始不相信卡是天使，慢慢变熟。每次看见翅膀都会心疼

> Dear Doctor, the path has never seemed more slow and yet I fear am nearing its end. Reason tells me you and I are unlikely to meet again, but I think I shall not listen to reason. I have seen the world inside your head and know that all things are possible. Hurry, though, my love. My days grow shorter now and I am so very weak. Godspeed, my lonely angel.

### 177.【destiel】S10E19 卡中自杀诅咒

（tag: 自杀倾向）

丁自杀倾向是为了不拖累别人，米自杀倾向是自我牺牲为了救丁，classic

what if卡也在这个案子里，也中了自杀诅咒，呼应S08E08卡的“I might kill myself”，看见自己又杀了这么多天使人类和S08E17洗脑时候杀的丁，拿天使刀准备自杀，已经开始捅了，丁醒过来想摇醒他但是做不到，抢刀抢不下来，无助绝望开始爆发表白卡活着对他有多重要，开始祈祷，卡听见祈祷醒过来听见了丁爱他

### 178.【Cas/destiel】S11E21 十字架

（inspired by: 路西被Amara钉成十字架）

what if Jesus's time, Cas offered to replace him, 被钉在十字架上

有点像兆，AC旁观biblical时期各种事件

### 179.【all】S11E22 What if they killed Darkness, what's end-of-reality bad

initial reasoning of why can't kill Darkness: Yin and Yang, Darkness and Light, light without dark, consequence is "end-of-reality bad"

they always try to prevent something bad happening to make a rush decision of something terrible, what if not killing Darkness is also one of these situations

what if imbalanced universe isn't as bad as they thought it would be

### **180.【destiel】what if Cas is a reaper**

reaper is a kind of angel, what if Cas is a reaper, meets Dean first time when he is reaping him (S01E12 Faith), or S04E01 when angels siege the pit and it's an all hands on deck situation so they ask for volunteers and reapers helped so Cas is in the siege team

Cas being reaper would probably freak Dean out more than he being an angel already is, dagger in heart but doesn't do him any harm

Cas rebel to Death to protect Dean when he needs to be reaped, Death more understanding than God (or not, like Billie)

could rewrite S4 to finale

(≈ prompt 164, 339)

### 181.【CasJimmy?destiel?】2077 AU

BMOL的金蛋“Hyperbolic Pulse Generator”可以驱逐各种附身体，恶魔、天使、大天使

what if丁在S4就拿到了这个道具，用在Jimmy身上把卡驱逐出去了，what will happen next

### 183.【destiel】《The day the saucers came》

### 184.【destiel】S10E03 Roadkill

看到S12E15 Sam调侃Dean的“You smell like roadkill”，想起来S10E03 Crowley说Cas快死的时候“Look at you. Talk about roadkill.”

what if Cas（本体？）真的是一只（差点被）roadkill的小鸟，被温双捡到了带回去救下来，或者是小鸟但是有很多条命所以被roadkill了之后能复活？可能第一次被impala撞了之后丁感到愧疚，第二次差点又撞了开始感觉诡异，swear这是同一只小鸟

卡也可能是别的动物，鹿或者猫？更喜欢小鸟因为有翅膀，可以掺wing kink

可能会童话风，或者SPN早期日常风

### 185.【destiel】S10E23 Death's condition is Cas

what if Death's condition is asking Dean to kill Cas (not Sam) because Death knows Cas would do anything (more than Sam) to get Dean back, so he's the bigger threat to the deal

Sam wouldn't say yes to Lucifer to save Dean, Cas would. Sam confessed he wouldn't trade everything to get Dean back, Cas would. So what if Death's condition is about Cas.

### 186.【destiel】S10E23 trick Death

what if Dean manages to fake Sam's death (tricks the Death) and gets sent to the Sun with both Sam&Cas alive. Sam kills Death, Cas fights to get Dean back, Sam thinks logically and wants to stop Cas, Cas knocks Sam out, works solo to get to Dean (some bad choices along the way)

even if Cas can't bring Dean back, he would go there and stay in the Sun with him, whatever it would do to his bod. He wouldn't let him stay there for eternity, alone.

### 187.【all】S15E10 bunker望远镜

到1510我们知道了bunker重启之后望远镜能看多元宇宙（说不定不重启本来也能看只是他们没去看，或者保留必须重启也可以）但是因为当时没有别的多元宇宙了所以什么也看不见，what if在别的多元宇宙都还在也都正常运转的时候出现了Mrs Butters这个案子，他们知道了功效也开始看那些宇宙里的事，会怎么样。看见别的世界出现悲剧或者看见别的版本的他们自己，如果无论如何过不去的话是不是会觉得像是观影体，三个人坐着看热闹犀利评价。如果是在S12E23之前，是在Jack出生、知道多元宇宙真的能过得去之前，会不会觉得望远镜里的不同版本只是魔法创造的多元可能的幻觉，就当成电影娱乐看了。

### 188.【all】what if Mary is not dead

What if in the night Sam gets fed demon blood, Mary is not in his room, not running into Azazel

Sam still has demon blood, but Mary is there raising them up, John is not obsessed with revenge, the boys are not trained to be hunters (maybe still has some basic training, but not raised like that)

The whole series get re-written.

### 189.【destiel】S13E01 what if angels took Cas's body

What if by the time Dean Sam came back to cabin after picking up Jack, angels have taken Cas's body

Dean will be furious, declare real war to angels to get Cas's body back, even though he knows he's already gone and the body is just body, he can't leave the last part of Cas to angels

### 190.【destiel】S12E23 chances of when the timing of door close changes

what if the door/rift to the apocalypse world is closed at different time of all the different times when someone is in the other worlds, what will happen:

- Cas in other world (the very first time go in there); Dean Sam Mary Lucifer in original world
- Dean Sam Cas in other world (first time Dean Sam see the rift and go explore); Mary Lucifer in original world
- Dean Sam Lucifer in other world (trick Lucifer into there trying to kill/trap him); Cas Mary in orginal world
- Dean Sam Cas Lucifer in other world (brief moment when Cas dashing in, before Dean Sam come back); Mary in original world
- Cas Lucifer in other world (Cas go in there check in on Dean Sam and try kill Lucifer)' Dean Sam Mary in original world

### 191.【destiel/all】S04E18《Winchester Gospel》

Cas: "One day, these books – they'll be known as the Winchester gospel."

want to see for whatever reason, Dean (/Sam) fastforward into future where Winchester Gospel is a real thing, people are reading, reciting, honoring these

### 192.【Jack】time travel to save Lucifer《Grandfather Paradox》

post-1518 after Jack becomes God and time travels back to before he's born, during the time Dean/Sam/Cas are fighting Lucifer and very close to actually permanently kill Lucifer, Jack has to save Lucifer otherwise time conflict and he won't be born, so from Dean/Sam/Cas's view, this kid comes from nowhere claiming to be God and helps Lucifer, that's gonna leave a bad first impression, they're gonna fight. Clean their memory in the end to be canon-converged? or return memory "so this is you??!"

### 193.【destiel】Dean time travel to save 1518 Cas 《Trolley Problem》

post-1518, to save Cas, Dean researches and figures out how to time travel (Henry/MOL knows how, they have angel feather and ingredients), goes back different points in their encounter trying to change things so Cas won't end up in 1518. Every time doesn't work, go back further

- change 1418/1503 not fighting
- 1409 prevent Cas from making the deal with Empty (Jack dies)
- 1223 prevent Cas from getting killed (to not go to Empty) (Lucifer kill all of them, they all die)
- 1209 stop Cas from killing Billie (Mary dies =1418, Billie not become Death)
- 1023 not kill old Death (Billie not become Death) -> later changes: more change Dean's action than Cas's
- 823 not let Cas go alone to ruin wings (so 1518 can fly them out) (if leave Sam with Cas, Sam dies)
- 623/701 stop Cas become God so won't try so hard for redemption in 823
- 401 try to not let Cas bring him back (when in Hell, stay stronger longer; or struggle to prevent Cas save him) but Cas still bring him back and profound bond again
- realize only way is to not make the deal in 222 and let Sam die

so conclusion, to save Cas: either Mary die or Sam die -> Dean, trolley problem, who are you gonna choose to save?

soulmate AU

destiel are not destined soulmate (tattoo doesn't have each other's name), but love each other deep enough they ignore the soulmate setting and choose each other, break the curse (?), the setting actually challenging to break them apart but they hold strong

### 198.【destiel】S12E19 the mixtape

post-1518 after Cas's gone, Dean manages to keep the emotions under control and pretends life going on the same as before, until one day he accidentally puts the mixtape "Dean's top 13 Zepp Traxx" on and play zepline and remembers this is the tape he gives Cas and Cas didn't bring it with at the end day, that's when Dean totally breaks down and cries out of breath

(or similarly, Dean doesn't dare to go into Cas's room after he's gone, one day for whatever reason he has to go in, and sees the tape on the desk, that's when he breaks down)

(-> prompt 209)

### 199.【destiel/all】S13E23 what if Lucifer becomes God and reshapes world as promised

If Dean doesn't say yes to Michael (or Michael has been killed by Jack/Lucifer before that, or Lucifer doesn't take Jack/Sam with him so Dean is not as motivated), then Lucifer gets God/Jack's power and becomes God and destroys/rebuilds the world as he likes. Lucifer kills Sam/Dean/Jack and all humans (~S15 Chuck kill everyone), who go to Heaven, and Lucifer doesn't like them still living in Heaven, so kill them again so they end up in Empty. Lucifer kills Cas too, so TFW reunite in Empty.

Lucifer controls the world/whole universe and all realities, so the only place out of his reach is the Empty (God has no power in the Empty). Now that TFW all in the Empty (find a way to wake them up and find each other in that darkness, maybe Empty helps), they can start plotting about how to come back and beat Lucifer from there and revive the world.

TFW: "If you kill us again and we end up in the Empty, we'll just come back again."

Lucifer: "And what are you gonna do to me? If you kill me, I'll just be there too."

TFW: "We'll lock you up."

双失忆梗，S07E02-17时间线（~梗40、159、25/158）

丁中了巫师失忆咒，遇到刚从河里出来的失忆卡，米这时候在被路西弄疯住院，Bobby是鬼魂，外面都是Leviathan

初遇时候丁给卡衣服，让他同车，想找米不记得回去路，卡治愈丁无果。Meg找到丁卡，介绍卡是丁男朋友，丁卡吃惊但是认了。丁每次忘记卡都要重新介绍，对丁耐心，丁卡真的男朋友状态一段时间，两个失忆但是都爱上对方了（掺一个别的case fic slow burn? 各种小情侣温馨片段，闲聊未来etc）。Meg指路巫师，丁无意说觉得这样也挺好，Meg警告卡如果恢复记忆丁想起卡他们可能没法保持这样，卡私心动摇想让丁保持这样。丁开始忘记呼吸走路濒死，卡不能看着丁死，找到杀了巫师逆转咒语让丁恢复记忆。丁恢复之后第一眼看见卡马上退开保持距离表现痛苦抗拒，卡难受知道他们结束了，Meg催丁让卡恢复记忆，丁私心动摇想让卡保持这样，自己承担痛苦。（这部分S07E17原作向）米濒死，丁告诉卡真相，卡杀恶魔恢复记忆但是保留了跟丁真的是男朋友部分桥段，失落差距更加难受，但是压抑住了。卡救米，自己疯，疯时期分不清现实记忆觉得丁跟他仍然是男朋友，不理解丁要离开丢下他，破碎濒死。丁留下来照顾卡，进入卡梦境/记忆帮卡把碎片拼起来救卡。卡拼起来醒来，不确定丁对他现在态度和他们关系，含蓄表达丁还是爱他的，互相都是，hopeful ending：两个人准备好一起去找米和杀Leviathan拯救世界了，together

### 202.【destiel】S13E23 what if Dean becomes the new God

what if Dean takes Michael's power, kills Lucifer, takes Lucifer's/Jack's power, banishes Michael, becomes the new God

### 203.【destiel】fix Cas's wings

canon Dean/Sam never even think about fixing Cas's wings, don't even realize it's a problem they need fixing, let alone researching any solution or asking for any superior power to help. Cas never raise any request regarding himself, so if they don't notice and mention to help, he'd never ask. But it's a part of his body, no different from human losing limbs, they should notice, he should ask, they should help to at least try to fix the issue, even if they end up not finding any solution

### 206.【all】Winchester is the nightmare story mother monsters tell baby monsters

可爱风小故事？童话风？

不记得是原剧台词还是哪里看到过的了，大致印象画面是有人跟温双说他们是”the nightmare story mother monsters tell baby monsters“

凶神恶煞温双（+卡）让monster baby瑟瑟发抖其实对不作恶小monster网开一面，对帮助人类的monster还能有机会收纳进自己圈子，（好）baby monster发现他们跟妈妈故事里讲的不一样

### 207.【Cas/destiel】S09E03 human Cas lose memory

卡变成人类之后因为人类大脑结构承载不了这么巨大的天使记忆容量，所以只能保留住了有限的一部分，记忆力受损，记不住几千万年天使时期的事情。卡在变成人类初期就意识到了，对自己记忆变差这件事接受不太良好，但是想着恢复天使之后应该就能恢复记忆所以保有希望也没有表现出来，但是在S10E18卡拿回grace之后发现失去的记忆没有回归，失去的就是失去了，突然难受了

Dean comforting an upset Cas

### 207.5【Cas】《Castiel's journal》

Read the spn tie-in book 《Supernatural: Bobby Singer's Guide to Hunting》, written from Bobby's POV, starting as Bobby getting memory curse and having to write down everything he knows about hunting and monsters before he forgets everything

extended from prompt 207

Cas realizes his memory is deteriorated during/after becoming human and continue to forget, so he starts writing journal about everything he can still remember, starting from the beginning of biblical time, old testimony stuffs that he experienced and did off-chart, like when he'd in Egypt trying to save the first-born sons

might be a very long book/journal, need to write in Cas tone

(maybe Dean would find out his journal or run into Cas when he'd writing, they'd have some conversation, Dean having his input, comforting Cas, Cas might start writing that down too)

### **208.【destiel】S14E13 the other 2003 timeline**

(time travel, getting together, pining, canon divergent)

The other timeline version Dean/Cas/Sam's life: 2003!Dean hunts on his own and keeps doing so and become the wanted criminal, 2003!Sam continue Stanford and becomes annoying flatulent lawyer and goes to TED talk, 2003!John is missing because he gets pulled into 2019, 2003!Cas notices "disturbance in the force" and goes to 2019 and finds 2019!Dean/Sam variation, fight them and almost kill them but get blown back to 2003 with memory of what's gonna happen

2003!Cas knows 2003!John shouldn't come back otherwise this version of criminal!Dean is going to disappear and he knows it's not right (from order? or he *knows* it's not right from the way 2019!Dean looks at him and sees him and calls him "Cas" and pleads, he starts doubt?) So Cas fights hard to prevent John come back (the phone call John thought he made to Dean didn't actually go through, he's still not back where he was, Cas traps him in a dream loop?) to protect that version of Dean

2003!Sam never comes back hunting, 2003!Dean still manage to stop apocalypses on his own (with Cas), so Sam is not the necessity for world saving, lack of John is -> epic length canon-divergent rewrites

2003!Cas still wears Jimmy as vessel, so Jimmy has been devout since at least 6 years before 401 to say yes to Cas

important: 2003!Cas=current Cas at 2003, it's the exactly same Cas as he was, the main world Cas start doubting/changing since meeting Dean in 2009, so if Cas starts knowing Dean since 2003, that's extra 6 years to start loving him and saving the world, might actually be in time to save the first apocalypse since beginning, like stopping Dean's demon deal (~《Heard from your mother》)

so it's gonna be a 2003-2019 16 season story of Dean&Cas hunting things, saving world, without Sam and John

### 209.【destiel】Cas's possessions

(extended from prompt 198)

1518之后丁要整理卡的东西，收拾bunker里他的房间，帮他洗车。卡没有多少属于自己的东西，为数不多有的那些也几乎全是丁给他的，比如磁带，也可能有别的礼物，Steve时期的洗漱用品，牙刷牙膏睡衣睡袋，1003没能量快死时期的睡袍，疯狗咒时期的毯子。丁一边整理一边回忆，一边崩溃

（高虐）

### 210.【all】把普通人误当做女巫

case fic

详见梦记2025-01-12改编

### 211.【destiel】S08E07 "I did not leave you"

Dean: "I did everything I could to get you out -- everything! I did not leave you"

it is important, remember that, whatever he does, he does not leave people behind

"I did not leave you", that's the abandonment issue talking, he gets left behind by so many others, so it is important that whatever happens, he needs to let Cas know, he does not and will not leave him

make it cute small everyday episode? TFW go to mall, go around, get separated/lost, Dean: "I did not leave you"

### 212.【destiel】S14E18 what if it's Cas that gets killed when Jack unleashes

what if instead of Mary going with Jack, it's Cas in that situation, and when Jack unleashes the power, Cas is right in front of him and gets vaporized

Jack freaks out, runs away, tries to fix it, goes after Rowena trying to bring Cas back

Dean finds out when comes back

no funeral for Cas because no body

someone prays hard enough to wake Cas up in the Empty again?

### 213.【destiel】S14E20 what if Dean fires equalizer hits Cas

When Dean tries to use Chuck's equalizer gun to hit Jack but Cas jumps in front of Jack and it hits him, so now Dean and Cas's lives are bound, a piece of Dean's soul is in Cas, they can see each other's view (more connected than ever)

now they need to protect themselves better and don't always think about self-sacrifice because if they hurt themselves they hurt each other <- actually healthier than ever

### 214.【all】S14E20 after Chuck says "welcome to The End" they wake up at the pilot

Chuck's End punishment is to throw them back into 101 Pilot timeline, with what they know but don't know which is real which is dream, the 14y may be dream or the new 101 beginning may be dream

the punishment is trying to make the point that, even with what they know, even if they try to change things from the beginning, the story is still going to go the way it is and lead to 1420 with nothing significantly changed, those who die still die or never come back alive

epic length total rewrite, they may go through first few seasons faster, knowing what they knew, but needs to work around many other things to avoid running into events that used to involve Chuck's intervention like many times Cas's resurrection (S04E22) as first major turning point. If Cas doesn't (or Dean doesn't let him) help prevent Lucifer back (he's back S05E01 anyway, "we have killed him once, more than once, we can do that again"), and S05E22 preventing apocalypse, so maybe the world straight into apocalypse world version

first time Dean wants to use holy water to check demon but Sam says saying "Christo" is a more reliable way, but down the road, they mostly only use holy water (except for the time with Jack and necromancer girl)

rewrite one of the times with demon that holy water doesn't work but saying "Christo" would do?

with Knight of Hell maybe? demon knife can't kill them, maybe holy water won't too (S12E12)

case fic

### 219.【all】S01E05 "six hundred years of bad luck"

Dean&Sam break all the mirrors in the shop, Dean: "This has got to be like... what? 600 years of bad luck?"

down the road in the episode with God of Luck (S15E11), they may realize it's all because of this case 15 years ago

some case fic about realizing that saying is actually true

### 220.【all】S01E05 mirrors can capture spirit

Dean: old superstition that says mirrors can capture spirit

modify to: mirrors can reflect soul (?)

case fic? use mirror to capture spirit to help the case, or to check the soul (so first time actually see the soul, some soul-related case in S06)

### 221.【destiel】time travel 1973 Zeppelin live

(~DW S14E02 Beatles live)

knowing Cas can time travel anywhere, Dean wouldn't miss the chance to witness Zeppelin live at least once

(can't do that everyday because it's probably still demanding on Cas's energy)

case fic, Dean gets to save Zeppelin for once, ends up showing up in one of their songs (change lyrics in "Stairway to Heaven" because they witnessed Cas)

### 225.【destiel】《Boy and the ghost》（Lyrics）

(by Tarja)

Wake up, wake up:

There's an Angel in the snow.

Look up, look up:

It's a frightened dead boy

With so much hate, such bad dreams.

He could have seen

The toy's the key, but no one saw, no one saw

<br>

All he wanted was a toy

All he needed was a bleeding heart

To lead him through the dark

Boy and the ghost

Despero, solitas, debilis, desolo.

<br>

When there's nowhere left to fall.

Nowhere to hide

The silence is hurting

Inside it's cold. Sleep or die.

Nowhere to go,

Nowhere to hide.

His light went out.

### 226.【destiel】S15E03 what if Belphegor becomes almost-God

if Cas doesn't stop Bel, follow the initial plan like Dean wants, Bel the demon (wearing Jack's body) becomes the almost-God, Rowena closes the rupture as planned, Cas gets trapped in the closed Hell, Chuck still the God

what now? trick them to let Bel handle Chuck?

### 227.【destiel】S15E03 what if Cas replace Bel to sound the horn

Cas smites Bel/Jack's body, has to continue use the horn to suck all souls into Hell and finish Rowena's spell, the rupture closes, Cas gets almost-God power (again), trapped in the closed Hell temporarily? vessel breaking down again? (almost S07E01 again)

Cas uses the power to go against Chuck & Billie

### 228.【destiel】精分丁/serial killer卡（狼人杀代）【WIP】

（inspired by 《My Bloody Valentine》）

case fic? witch's spell?

Dean hallucinate some killer/monster in town, insist on hunting; the others can't see but there are deaths/missing people in town, they investigate

truth is it's Dean killing/abducting people but he doesn't know, it's witch's spell

they caught Dean in camera/in action, can't snap him out of it, worry it's demon possession or demon!Dean or Mark of Cain!Dean, worry they'll have to kill him

they find the witch/proof of there is a witch, hunt them down, snap Dean out of it, save him and others (in some cave/underground/abandoned house, alive)

OR: it's self-unaware amnesic serial killer Cas (S9 human!Cas time), thinking he's helping the Winchesters on case, actually he's the one committing it, he doesn't even know -> Dean feel betrayed again? trust issue like 619 between destiel again?

OR: combine both, they're both cursed and both the serial killers, but neither knows, so both suspect the other, turn on each other for a bit, then realize the witch has them both -> kill the witch, save the day

idea check-in summary: Inspired by Jensen's "My Bloody Valentine", Dean/Cas/Sam go into this small town and find people dying, try to solve the case but find it very difficult, meanwhile Dean/Cas find their motel has some bloody evidence, one of them might be the secret murderer, but all three of them deny it. They start getting suspicious and turn against each other a bit, Dean thinks it's Cas getting brainwashed and start killing people without himself even knowing, Cas thinks it's Dean maybe having some relapse from Mark of Cain/demon!Dean time. People continue getting killed bloody around them, by coincidence both Dean/Cas has no alibi (could have potentially committed it and framed on the other unknowingly). They monitor each other 24/7 trying to figure out who is wrong and very on edge. Then big revelation.

(revelation: both destiel are killers)

S10 timeline, MoC!Dean & stolen-grace!Cas

### **229.【destiel】S15E20 souls been to Hell can't go to Heaven, Dean is in private Hell**

souls went to hell can't go to heaven → 1520 after Dean's death, he thought he's in heaven but actually it's Hell's private room Rowena gave him (the best they can offer given the situation)

he saw Bobby, Sam, Cas in his "heaven", seems normal at first, but realize something wrong/off in this world later (not exactly like a dream but not like them either, something OOC in Bobby/Sam/others?), leave the private room, go out, see it's actually Hell. demons don't hurt him, he meets Rowena, who tells him truth

Rowena: Your boy Jack tried, but rule is rule, it's natural cosmic rule, not even Jack can break it

Dean: Bobby gets out, my dad too

Rowena: Chuck kill universe for fun, can't really use that as a reference, don't you think?

Dean: So the Bobby and Sam I saw in there?

Rowena: Some of my best actors I put in there

Dean: Cas too?

Rowena: Oh that one, he just can't take a no to drop by (Rowena's all knowing smile/wink.gif)

Cas comes out of that Hell's private room to meet him

Cas: Sorry Dean, I can't bring you to Heaven

Dean: Yeah I heard, if Jack can't do anything, figured you can't either, but why come inside 

Cas: Can't leave you there alone with the demons, can I?

Rowena: I'll leave you two to it then (extract all other demons out)

Dean: Looks like it's just you and me now

### 230.【destiel】天启世界黑卡勒维坦化+enemy to friend+互相代餐梗【WIP】

在天启世界的正式天启期间那个世界的黑卡接了米迦的指示去打开炼狱，想借用炼狱力量打路西，结果卡把勒维坦都吞了以后自己能量大爆发升级成帝卡，直接把天启打成三方阵营，或者直接一己之力同时炸掉米迦和路西，把整个宇宙变成帝卡宇宙，或者米迦和路西不得不联手来打帝卡，温双进来的时候黑卡正在一打二状态。

米迦/路西：The bitch went crazy.

路西：He's your man, you solve your mess.

米迦：I sent him because of you! If it's not for you fighting so hard --

路西：What? So you're making it my problem now?

（一不小心就会掺一些米路，但是主要还是卡中心）

（卡疯起来就没他俩什么事了）

黑卡杀了主世界卡，他们一定要黑卡合作才可能拯救主世界或者所有多元世界来打Chuck。丁不得不跟黑卡合作，同时仍然非常强烈地grief, mourn他的主世界卡，恨死黑卡，想杀他给主世界卡复仇，但是又矛盾觉得他也是卡，于是又不得不强忍着不想在亲手杀死一个卡。一起经历了一些事情，双方慢慢从真的完全互相想要杀死对方的enemy状态到可以忍受对方存在到越来越熟悉亲近，互相用对方代自己想要爱的人，丁用黑卡代主世界卡，黑卡骗自己丁关心的爱的假装就是他，但是心底也知道是且只能是另一个自己，自己无论如何不可能替代丁自己的主世界卡。

（互相代餐梗+enemy to something梗，比一般常见的rival to friend/lover更加strong，start with不止是rival而是真的互相想要杀掉对方因为黑卡杀了他爱的卡，to something到底是变成了什么关系非常难定义，不是lover，也很难称得上friend，just someone）

### 231.【destiel】**《When Death Meets Empty》Dean=Death, Cas=Empty**

A new ending, post-death, post-1520

Jack becomes new God, Dean becomes new Death (after 1520 his human death), Cas becomes new Empty (after 1518 his angel death)

Empty can't go to Earth so Cas can't tell Dean what happened after he's taken away and Dean thought he's dead. Dean has the option to become new Death because he has taken the job once (for a day) and no other reaper has interest in the position, so Dean thinks why not.

Death can go to the Empty, so that's the first thing he does after he takes the new job. He sees Cas, initially thought it's the old Empty taking his form, but Cas tells him he manages beat the old Empty and takes over. He releases the angels and demons that shouldn't be there (so before Dean's death he probably would run into a few? knows something happened in the Empty but doesn't know what, didn't think it's possible), but now still stuck in the place

Dean: it's okay, I can pay you visit once in a while, hell, I can stay here if you want

Cas: don't you have a job to do? you know, reaping people?

Dean shrugs: the world runs fine with Death trapped underground for two thousand years, it will do just fine

Sam (at some point): so I'm the only one that still human

Dean: he's just jealous.

(Death & Empty's dates, title inspired by 《When Harry met Sally》)

### 232.【destiel】S09E22 what if Cas doesn't give up the army

what if they manage to find a way to prevent Dean from killing Tessa, Cas doesn't have to give up the army, he can use the army to fight Metatron, Dean wouldn't be killed and become demon Dean (yet), they beat Metatron without Dean dead, lock him up

Cas would still die slowly of the borrowed grace, Dean would kill angel to save him (like Crowley did)

Dean would kill Metatron or force him to return Cas's grace (S10E18 moved forward)

Dean probably would still die of some random reason (move one of his later death forward), they still need to handle demon Dean or the Mark problem

potential solution: let Cas take the Mark, rotate the carrying (who said Mark has to stay with one person? they can take turns being Darkness's prison guard, but the guard is also the prisoner)

### 233.【destiel】S10E18 堂吉诃德AU/引用/xover

### 235.【destiel】S15E20 Bobby lied

原剧本在丁死的时候丁米有一句台词是“If Cas was here”“But he's not”，但是这句在拍的时候被拿掉了，有以下两种可能：

- 如果Bobby说的是实话，卡在丁上天堂的时候确实已经回来了而且帮忙重建了天堂，那就又有这几种可能：
  - 卡在丁死的时候已经回来了，那么这两句台词就不成立所以被拿掉了，不能说“but he's not”，因为他已经回来了，那么他就会知道丁快死了，那就要解释卡为什么没有在丁受这么重伤（但又不是天使治愈不了的伤）的时候出现救他，卡不可能看着丁痛苦濒死而不来救他，可能性有：
    - 除非卡这个时候被洗脑了，那说明Naomi回来了而Jack对天堂没有100%的控制力或者他也不得不跟着天堂政治走（Jack被Dumah manipulate地带着走过一次，不排除就算有了上帝能力他可能也没法在政治方面overcome他们
    - 或者单纯是天堂新规，Jack立下的规矩，no one bends the rule again，死了就是死了，天使也不能随意下地面了，说不定索性把天堂地狱门都关了，卡在上面下不来，只能等着丁自己上天堂之后才能重逢
  - 或者卡是在丁死和丁上天堂之间的时间间隙里回来的，那就说明天堂也是在这个间隙之间重建的，那么
    - 要么利用了时间流速差，天堂看起来好像已经重建了那么久，Bobby已经过舒坦了，Mary、John、Rufas他们都已经有自己生活了，但是从地球时间来看这个天堂仍然是卡专门在丁上天堂之前才把天堂重建出来的
    - 要么这就是天堂刚刚重建好的样子，看起来好像都是自然发展出来的其实就是卡给他们安排的样子，那就说明丁看见的整个天堂的样子都是卡专门在他上天堂之前的瞬间搭出来的只是为了他的
- 更有可能的是，Bobby说谎了，卡没有真的回来，这么说只是为了让丁安心让他在天堂可以有peace，这也解释了为什么丁来了以后一直没看见卡，因为卡一直还在虚无，在丁死的时候“but he's not”也成立：那么就能写丁在天堂始终没看见卡，周围人总是在搪塞，终于慢慢意识到卡其实没真的回来，于是后面又要开启去虚无救卡的行动了 

### 236.【destiel】S03E08 "one for me, one for my baby"

originally from S03E08 Sam's Christmas gift for Dean: candy bar and oil, Dean: "fuel for me, and fuel for my baby"

Charlie help Claire be less angry, Claire after 18y want to be with Charlie (both les), Charlie hesitates, Claire: "what's the matter? thought you like girls, and you like me", Charlie: "not like that", Claire: "how do you know" -> maybe together, maybe kiss?

### 238.【destiel】S08E17 克隆Dean替身梗

（同时有西部世界AU和黑镜AU的感觉，替身梗，inspired by rupertgayes《Less Than Ghosts》《where everybody knows》）

卡在817见过那么多丁克隆体，卡自己也是最了解怎么修复和复制丁身体的，当他觉得他不能拥有丁之后他离开给自己造了个丁一起过，真丁吃醋

（1503离婚期canon divergent？那时的God也不在，算是短暂平静期）

### **238.5【destiel】S08E17 一地下室的克隆Dean身体**

（继续是西部世界和黑镜的感觉）

（817：2013，1520：2020，西部世界：2016，黑镜：2011 ← 可以直接剧情里吐槽就像这两个了）

在817之后卡见过了这么多丁克隆体，把那季主世界任务解决+卡搞定洗脑问题之后想到为了给丁以防万一备用，以防自己之后失去grace（s9之后）或者不在丁身边时候（s11路西卡之后）丁身体出问题，提前在bunker地下室给丁准备了一地下室的备用身体

丁一开始不知道，在第一次看到之后freak out了，觉得是卡的freaky kink，跟卡有miscommunication的hurt/comfort吵架，然后在人类卡时期意识到了确实是卡的有备无患，虽然没用到过但是确实有道理，就理解和好了。（也会要求卡多备一些米和他自己/Jimmy的身体？）

Mark of Cain时期考虑过为了甩掉Mark而换身体，但是Mark是在灵魂上的所以跟着走了

1520 丁身体受重伤卡又不在，觉得没希望已经准备放弃了，想起来还有那么多备份身体，硬撑着让米把他带到备份身体身边，灵魂换身体，重新续下去继续活了，感受到了卡提前太久就已经给他考虑好的后备方案泪目了，抱着备份卡的身体哭

（可以提前在另外别的地方准备卡的备份grace？像Gabe能量可以常年一点一点被抽取转移，卡也可以一点一点抽取积累出一管，1518走之前留给丁，于是在最后这个时候尝试把卡的grace放进卡的克隆身体里，于是重新得到了一个卡）（但是总感觉有哪里不太对，好像这个无论如何也只是一个代餐卡不是本体卡）

### 239.【destiel】S04E17 Dean Smith + ghost Cas【WIP】

(canon-divergent? pre-S04E17->post-S04E17)

(tag: ghost Cas, S04E17, Dean Smith)

normal human non-hunter Dean (parents Bobby/Ellen, sister Jo, went to Stanford, sales director, 3 weeks in Sandover Bridge & Iron Inc.), move into new apartment which is haunted by ghost that turned out to be Cas

human Dean + ghost Cas -> freaked out for a bit (horror/suspension at beginning before turn out to reveal it's Cas), then ~domestic life -> Dean know about ghost & supernatural is real, help Cas revenge his death (whole family Jimmy/Amelia/Claire killed by Nick), finish his unfinished business (Dean thought) but Cas still ghost, Dean puzzled (new unfinished business bc of Dean) -> S04E17 event, Cas help figure out the spirit, Dean get rid of it without Sam -> Zach confront, Dean Smith: "I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover"

(more fluff than horror)

### 241.【destiel】寂静之地AU

恐怖电影风格，黑镜机器黑狗集+寂静之地

### 242.【destiel】DW怪“寂静”

只有在注视着的时候才能记住的怪

在手上画道作为提醒

horror genre

### 243.【destiel】S05E03 "because you're the only one that helps me"

S05E03 Cas to Dean: "I ask for *your* help, because *you* are the only one that helps me", Cas doesn't have anyone else but Dean, Dean's the only one he has

and Cas is the only angel that saves Dean from Hell and helps him

all they have is each other, and it's always been like this

so S15E03 when Cas leaves, he has no one and nothing

homeless orphan AU? two poor kids lean on each other and raise each other in this cruel world?

### 244.【destiel】《Phantom Wings》

(title inspired by 《Phantom Pain》, visual inspired by 《Captain America 4》)

Cas's wing is raw ripped from him in whole by (Raphael/Lucifer/...?), thrown onto Earth, leaving him bleeding out

(some angel falling to earth movie reference? the wound on the shoulder blade, wing-like)

Dean finds his wing?

(-> can be combined with prompt 173)

### 245.【destiel】S10E03 demon Dean sees Cas's true form

When Dean was demon, he sees Cas's true form, and on borrowed grace and broken wings, and dying

but he didn't care at the moment because he was demon, but he remembered after turning back and feeling in awe and awful bad for Cas

so after handling the world crisis, start actively help looking for ways to help cure Cas's grace and wings (even if Cas himself want to convince him it doesn't matter, but Dean knows it does)

### 246.【Crowley】S08E21 director Crowley

Crowley: "I'm born directing"

director Crowley AU

+S06E15 actor Dean/Sam/Cas AU?

### 247.【destiel】S08E01 what if they find angel tablet first

the whole S8's ending, they wouldn't be so screwed if they didn't do the demon trial in the first place, it would be a good year with no consequential disasters (falling angel etc. and everything after that), they would certainly go through the trial if they know it's possible, but what if they don't

demon tablet is found and introduced between S07E23 & S08E01, found by Crowley without showing how and he just grabbed Kevin to decipher it

What if at that time, somewhere between S07E23 & S08E01, the tablet found by Crowley is angel tablet, and Kevin found about the trial to close the Heaven's gate

(angel tablet was warded against angels and stored in Lucifer's crypt, then demon tablet must be warded against demons and stored in some angel's place like St. Michael's church or sth, so Crowley shouldn't have been able to get to it)

so after Dean comes back from Purgatory, find Kevin, find the trials (child of angel&human love, bow of cupid who triggered gay romance, grace of angel who fall in love with human), not so motivated to close angel's door

make it so they wouldn't know the third trial at the end, and once they know, they for sure would know it must be Cas, but no way Dean would want to use Cas's grace and shove him back to Heaven, so they would want to stop the trial. The fun part of the loophole, initially it would be Dean doesn't want to use Cas's grace or shove him back to heaven (S08E23 conversation "ET goes home"), but if it works, Cas without grace would remain on earth, so he wouldn't be shoved back to heaven, they can all still remain on earth. but they also don't realize (/realize too late) once Dean finishes the trial, he'll die and go to Heaven and Heaven's gate would be closed, so it's the other way around -- Dean stuck in Heaven, Cas stuck on Earth. they'll need to figure out from there

or if like S08E23 once Cas find out Dean will be the sacrifice and will die, he'll stop the trial and stop Dean, but Dean will be mortally hurt, Cas will have to find ways to save him (maybe using his own grace, feed into his system to heal) (give up his grace entirely to put into Dean to save him? life for life situation?)

so when Dean comes to, he's healed, Cas's either human like S09 start or fading like S10 start

### 248.【jenmish/destiel】firefighter AU

(inspired by Misha's poem "Fire and Water")

ten years ago and later, LA fire

ten years ago, Misha running the hill and almost died but saved by the water coming from the helicopter, god-given like

ten years later, the fire again, lake being drained to save fighter. not in danger, not purified, only sadness, only the runner in these hills

### 249.【jenmish/human destiel】Junk Mail

(inspired by Misha's poem "Junk Mail")

domestic life or long distance miscommunication

one version is Neil Gaiman style, the marriage proposal story, reading the junk mail describing a life never had

different version is two living far apart and received junk mail but thought it's real, angst, mutual pining

### 250.【Gabe】《You need better friends》

Gabe/Loki, Gabe/Rowena, Gabe/Kali, Gabe&Luci

Gabe&Sam, Gabe&Dean, Gabe&Cas

who's his friend & family and he died for

character study: memoir style, at the end turn out it's Gabe reliving his whole life before stabbed to death in the Apocalypse world, thinking back (a bit sad)

Dean: "You need better friends" Gabe: "I'm protecting the ones I have" (reuse the dialogue with Cas)

(30min Gabe collection clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E6DdhOkU3s)

### **250.5【Gabe/Loki】wear your face**（R级）

title potential: 《The faces we wear》(reuse), 《In the mirror》《Wear Your Face》

Gabe/Loki has had a thing going on between them back when Gabe saves Loki (hang out a bit, very similar, same vibe, get together, kiss/sex/etc.), then asks for Loki's help. Letting Gabe wear Loki's face is Loki's kink (≈ego, Loki gives Gabe half his own real body) which Gabe also enjoys, initially start as more sensational/sexual, but gradually find more common ground and gets to romantic but neither recognize it

after breakup/Gabe leave (S5 to save apocalypse), Gabe can change face but still choose to keep Loki's (excuse is witness protection but actually sentimental, wants to see him in the mirror, kiss mirror tho self-disgust?), 519 still pretend as Loki (Loki can blow his cover but doesn't, Gabe gets triggered nostalgia in 519 in front of Odin/Baldur)

after 519 thought Gabe is dead, Loki depressed for a bit (pretend as if mourn Odin/Baldor, actually for Gabe), (according to 1320) Gabe go back to Loki, Loki pissed at him, want to punish him, sell him to Asmodeus, not realize Asmodeus's torture, thought archangel can handle it, genuinely surprised when a heartbroken/hatred Gabe come to kill him for revenge, Gabe hate him for betrayal, neither can't clarify/confess/communicate properly cuz Winchesters are there, Gabe heartbroken and hate himself but kill Loki

but Loki isn't dead (trickster professional fake death, same way Gabe fakes his own death), just that half body is destroyed (as long as one of them is alive, the other can't die, can resurrect/regenerate to whole from half), essence is with Gabe (but wounded/asleep) when he gets to AU world, wake up take control/share mojo when Gabe fight Michael, kill Michael/Lucifer, come back this world together, communicate, still both pissed (legitimate, killed my father and my sons; Loki: "figure I'd have to make more", Gabe: "ever think of maybe not the horse or wolf or those creatures again? time to civilize", Loki: "you say Nephilim isn't allowed because it's half human, but I'm not human"), but can somehow work it out

### 251.【cockles】Jensen call Misha "Dimitri" on bed（R级）

Russian accent kink, name kink

right on edge, call him "Dimitri", in that low hoarse sex tone, makes him come at once

then too many times like that, get used to the pattern, then in the public, comic con, call him "Dimitri" in the public, immediate boner

### 252.【destiel】S15E18 break his happiness to protect him

Cas is happy after the confession

Dean's only move is to break his happiness, make him miserable, so Empty's deal is voided, that's how he make Cas stay, and live

they'll figure out the truth later, once safe

they'll need to figure out how to handle Billie&Chuck too, then go back to it

### **253.【destiel】14卡+天使丁**

14丁卡时间线，卡说过天使都飞走了（所以他失去了所有能量），what if 突然飞来一只同世界线未来的天使，是天使丁，但是失忆，忘记了自己是怎么“变成”天使的，可能觉得自己一直都是天使（其实因为是同时间线，是14丁演化成的）。但是对卡来说但凡有天使来了他就能慢慢恢复，所以能量开始慢慢回来了。然后卡要帮未来丁想起来他发生了什么，要搞明白路西米后来怎么样了，僵尸世界怎么救，14卡怎么治愈，丁卡心理阴影都要很久才能治愈，原时间线14丁在天使丁来的时候去哪了（可以double date式互换？进入天使丁对应的未来卡时间点？或者同时也在）

similar setting but different story：飞来的天使是S4/5时期的卡，卡帮自己？（可以用失忆解决时间线paradox问题）

如果天使丁是来自别的AU世界，为什么天使丁飞到这个世界了：因为他原本世界的卡死了

（心理阴影治愈部分灵感来自北麻《Into the Fire》）

### 254.【Benny&Garth】S15E09 where is Benny

tag: werepire (ship name)

After S8 Benny get sent back to Purgatory, what happened to him. not dead. but why when S15E09 Dean asked about him in Purgatory, the monsters/vampires said so, must have lied, but why. Benny actually get power in Purgatory? like how Rowena rule the Hell, would be nice to have Benny rule Purgatory (Dean: "he probably runs Purgatory by now" is true), but he isn't really the ruler type, power isn't what he want, did he find Andrea? is there sea in Purgatory where they can continue being vampirate? would he be disappointed/upset about Andrea turn on him back on Earth so move on from her? find Garth instead after Garth died of old age as werewolf?

Outline:

Benny&Garth: stranger-to-friend (stay friendship, not slash); background destiel

say S14E10 Garth didn't survive Michael, goes to Purgatory already (talking about coming pubs' name Sam and Castiel)

S08E19 Benny stay in Purgatory, struggle a bit, a legend in Purgatory for escaping and then coming back, climbs up in power in Purgatory by killing attacking vampires and leviathans, learn the best hunting skill from Dean (the ultimate predator in Purgatory to survive/hunt for a year), Benny survive 6 years until meeting Garth

Garth appear and help Benny (or other way around), the two work together, bicker a bit ("I got no beef with you, mate" "I know, we're not living in Twilight"), turn friends

S15E09 time, leviathan lies, Benny find Dean, save him from some attacking monsters, Dean ask him to find Cas (Benny: "you lost your angel again?"), Benny rally his men; Garth find Cas, save him from leviathan, destiel reunite, Benny/Garth/Dean catch up briefly, bring them back through Michael's portal, continue to live & save the world together

### 255.【Crowley】S09E11 search the ocean for first blade

ocean is salty water, demon Crowley get sting and wounded by the sea?

(inspired by 2025-04-05 dream)

### 256.【Crowley/all】S08E02 Hell claim Moon

(inspired by Northern Sparrow's《Into the Fire》)

how is it like to claim the moon? is there a fight between Heaven/Hell over the moon? Is that why all the dips and pits on moon? marks of the angel/demon fight? Is that why moon keeps looking at the Earth on one side, because demons rest on the other side?

Dean/Sam/Cas need to go to moon to exorcise/free moon from demons?

### 257.【jenmish】confession

詹反复重温手机上录的卡表白录像，其实是詹反复想听米沙说爱他，是詹的不安全感在作祟

### 258.【destiel】S06E17 White Russia

(should be mostly destiel, but maybe some minor hint/inspired from jenmish)

When Cas brings Dean/Sam away to protect them from Atropos, his first instinct is to fly them to White Russia. Why White Russia? anything to do with Misha's connection with Russia?

accent kink? (Jen's kink, can project to Dean)

(slightly inspired by a fic where there is a line of Cas saying goodnight to Dean in Russia)

### 259.【destiel】《Always Will Be》（Lyrics）

(by Hammerfall)

Our sun is set, our day is done

I'm left here wondering

Is this the end? My final words to you

Day turned to night

Now you're gone, I'm left here pondering

Can this be true? Are we really through?



You were the wind beneath my wings

Taught me how to fly

With you I lived among the kings

How could this ever die?



So I say farewell, I'm yours forever

And I always will be

We were one, we were all, we were the only

Future full of hope, nothing could stand in our way

But dreams can change, visions fall, I feel so lonely

I would walk through fire for just one more day



You were the angel of my life

Taught me to be free

Now, I'm a stranger in your eyes

Walls are closing in on me



So I say farewell, I'm yours forever

And I always will be

Missing you in my heart, you are the one

And you always will be



When I turn to the east, I see no dawn

But after darkness comes the light

When I turn to the west, the slight night hides all

Where is the light that shines so bright?

### 260.【destiel】Castiel is not a who, he is a day, a land

he is time, he is a day, he *is* Thursday (inspired by 《[suddenly, all at once](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1554563)》summary: "Dean falls in love on a Thursday")

he is space, he is a land, he *is* a place (inspired by Neil Gaiman "Sandman" The Greenland)

he is anything but human, he doesn't have vessel, how do you fall in love with time and space? and expect the time and space love you back?

### 261.【micifer】Michael killed Lucifer but he didn't mean to, and he wants to fix it

or the other way round

(inspired by *[Into the Fire](https://archiveofourown.org/works/4080676)* and *[Exceptional Circumstances](https://archiveofourown.org/works/341760/chapters/568924)*, and all the codependence parallel between Winchesters)

Michael/Lucifer = Dean/Sam parallel, they want to follow the script and fight but actually also love each other and not really want the other die

the four archangels are probably close, S05E19 Lucifer doesn't want to kill Gabriel and when he did, he's actually sad about it

what if they actually manage to have the apocalypse as they wish and they fight, but they intended to send the other away (e.g. to Pit), but end up accidentally kill the other for real, the realization terrifies the living one, wants to tear the world apart to bring the other back, or to find God to resurrect the other; maybe go look for help from TFW?

or use the apocalypse world version, where Michael indeed killed Lucifer and left alone in a trashed world, he finds the world meaningless, that's the real reason why he wants to travel to other worlds, the ones Lucifer is still alive (and his AU self isn't in the way) -> except he has to fight him again, he doesn't want to kill him either this round, thought Dean wouldn't be strong enough to achieve that, get surprised Dean succeed in killing Lucifer, the world is without Lucifer again, this Michael is left alone again, none of his brother alive, his experiments with monsters to wipe clean the human, is it because so there will be no human soul for heaven/hell, all become monster and go to purgatory, that's the only way he can actually shut down heaven/hell and end it all?

### 262.【destiel】《Burn With Me》（Lyrics）

(by Amaranthe)

You are gone to the highest bidder

Now you're with a man that is God's worst sinner

Well no, don't care about me

I am just the man meant to set you free

I tried to make you a part of me

I even told you what would happen theoretically

There is this something that I need to know

Why am I the only one that lost it all?



But every day and every time I turn around

Searching for a place that I have left behind

And all I wanna believe

That you could bleed so



Burn with me

I'm just an empty shell

Another's friend

Transformed to someone else

Take your seat

I cast a spell

So you'll be less like you

And more like someone else



（401 Lazarus rising; demon Dean+angel Cas）

### 263.【destiel】《Mystery of a Blood Red Rose》（Lyrics）

(by Avantasia)

We've played our roles in our passion plays

They've imposed on us right from the cradle

No matter what you dream

Beware of what you say

Until the cogwheel's out of control

To burst out of place



No time to breathe

Don't have no time to waste

Bring on the night

Seize every drop of life away



Slice a tasty hour off from

Or in a blink it will be gone

A stranding future bring it on



（2014 endverse destiel）

### 264.【destiel】《Phantom Divine》（Lyrics）

(by Kamelot)

I am all you ever wanted

I'm a new dimension

Immortality perfected, phantomized

Expansion of life

Generation of light

Finding every deviation

Just to keep the future alive



Under a phantom divine

Touched by the light

The ambrosial grace

No applause for the old pantomime

In the shadows of our dreams

A phantom divine



I'm the face of the selected

I'm your chain reaction

I'm mortally rejected

I am the empire connecting the mind

And I'll die just to keep you alive

### 265.【destiel】《Die Another Day》（Lyrics）

(by Noctura)

Believe me

Never meant to make you feel this way

Forgive me

Before I die another day



I can't erase

The things I said that made you go away

Give me just one chance and hear me say

I'm sorry



（S1503-09 big fight divorce time, Dean: "I'm sorry"）

### 266.【destiel】DW912 Cas has to wipe Dean's memory to save him

mimic DW912 way of storytelling

show as if it's Dean forgetting, Cas telling the story → twist: it's Cas forgetting

something huge happened, the only way to save Dean's life is Cas wipe Dean's memory of him (otherwise angels can use his memory of Cas to find him?), Dean eavesdrop and know what Cas is about to do, reverse the polarity of the device, Dean/Cas take a bet of whether or not it worked, turns out Cas's memory wiped, but "lost memory become story"

### 267.【destiel】DW204壁炉女孩 memory reading

> Doctor: If there is anything you don't want me to see, just imagine a door and close it. I won't look.
>
> Reinette: Lonely then and lonelier now. How can you bear it?
>
> Doctor: How did you do that?
>
> Reinette: A door once opened may be stepped through in either direction.

Cas read Dean's memory, but door can be stepped either direction, Dean start reading Cas's memory (startled Cas)

### **268.【destiel】S04E01 Dean lobotomize Cas in Hell during angel rescue**【WIP】

(inspired by a comment under my tumblr post mentioning Cas 0817 is lobotomized) (heavy angst, canon compliant, canon divergent)

start scene as if normal hospital operation scene, Dean enter in Doctor coat, acting operation on patient, they scream, turn out it's lobotomy, Dean enjoys the process and thinks he's doing the right thing (write in a way as if it's just a Doctor AU, but actually canon-divergent; unnoticeably knowing Azazel&Dean interaction, Dean trusts him, Azazel showing him tricks and Dean outskills him, Azazel=father figure)

turn out this is in Hell, except not even Dean realizes that, he thinks he's doing the right thing, those people need that, so he's doing that to them, he knows it's causing them pain, but he thinks it's a good thing, he feels good about himself (calm tone, not angsty, easy at torturing); when some patient fight back, he constrain them with force, still think it's what's best for them

(the visual of pocket room of Hell, everyone's individual Hell: inspired by *Lucifer*)

then angels come to rescue, Cas is the first/only angel fights off all the demons outside his pocket-Hell and enter the operation room, get force transformed into human vessel form in there, Dean thinks he's just another soul to operate on, Cas try to reason with him, but rule one of save, Dean needs to agree to leave to be saved, but Dean doesn't even realize this is hell so he wouldn't want to leave, and he just thinks Cas is another patient trying to fight/talk his way out; Dean force Cas down (win their fight, cuz Cas hold back, doesn't want to hurt the Righteous Man) to the operation table, lobotomize Cas, Cas forget why he's down here, that he's an angel and he's coming to save Dean, now Cas thinks he's same as Dean so hang around in the room, be his assistant

Cas without memory/knowledge, slow learner, but pick up the tools, operate on others like Dean show him, Dean start to get interested in him (though initially think he's just weird and need punish), fond of him, start trusting him; demons know he's angel, come in (in human form) try to take Cas away, Dean instinctively protect Cas, kill demons

Azazel (in doctor director costume) come in to try to take Cas away/kill him on sight, Dean doesn't let him, Azazel commands Dean kill Cas or he'd be disappointed at him (father figure), Dean hesitates, acts as if intend to kill Cas (Cas frightened) but ends up didn't, instead rebels to Azazel, leaves the operation room and takes Cas with him to outside, see real Hell, shocked, Cas remembers he has wing (reminded by Balthazar?/Dean, Dean believes what he said before lobotomy is true now, tell him back what he initially said), use wing to protect Dean, demons attack, Cas purely muscle memory fight (still vessel shape, still doesn't remember other things before lobotomy), hand on Dean's shoulder (burns Dean, yell) and flies him out ("Dean Winchester is saved")

Cas go back to heaven to regain a copy of memory (backuped before fight/standard version for all angels) from Naomi (hint potential memory messed up again), back in time to meet Dean in barn again, canon compliant

(Title: **"Heaven Sent, Hell Bent"** "In the Grip of Madness")

(→ prompt 328.5)

### 269.【micifer+destiel】Michael!Dean + Lucifer!Cas（R级）

can be R18+

Michael/Lucifer doi using Dean/Cas body, very disturbing, probably considered as non-con

after Michael/Lucifer leave, Dean/Cas freak out, fumbling around sexual tension and emotion, angsty, mutual pining (standard soap opera drama)

OR, Michael/Lucifer one kill the other, doesn't matter who kill who, when they leave/banished, Dean/Cas one of them remember kill the other with his own hand, gonna be massively messed up, freak out, grieving widower period, suicidal, etc. (standard mourning drama)

### 270.【sabriel】S03E11 groundhog day because Gabe wants Sam notice him

groundhog day where the whole worlds repeat around Sam, everyone else only lives that day once and doesn't remember, but Gabe is always in there with Sam, drinking the same drink every morning, observe him, be with him; so Gabe traps himself in the loop with Sam as well, he's patient as an archangel, but after thousands of times of drinking the same drink, he finally gets bored of it so that morning he orders a different drink, that's how Sam finds out

(sabriel thought:) Gabe knows the only way for Sam to think of anything other than his brother is when Dean is gone, so this is Gabe's version of taking Dean out of chess board to interact with Sam alone. So that Wednesday after the looping Tuesday where Dean is dead, for months, all Sam can think about is to revenge and capture Gabe, this is the only time Sam is wholeheartedly thinking about Gabe (even if it's hate), Gabe finally has his attention (as this is what Gabe wants: be noticed ← he's proud of his ability to hideout in the human crowd and not get noticed, but once a while he also wants to get noticed and feel good about it, so this is Gabe's messed-up love-hate version of getting someone (Sam)'s full attention, because growing up this is something Gabe never gets)

### 271.【Charlie/Alicia】Transcendence/AI（F/F）

《What Is Life》

(tags: Canon Divergent, Canonical Main Character Death, S12E20, post-canon, fix-it)

(inspired by *Transcendence*)

Charlie has been uploading her brain info to bunker computer, basically turns herself into a big AI with her own memory & intelligence built-in, but not waken yet (after 1022 unexpected death, her initial plan is to wake it by herself to test/have fun/help boys around the bunker) (←TFW find Charlie's journal/notebook)

Alicia Banes is a twig/twine doll after 1220, live like that for three years (post-1520) but can't bear it anymore (impervious, un-human, can self-heal, out of place, hiding from human society (TFW thought it's bc herself, but actually bc Max); Max depressed, cursed to Hell, want to release Max from demon deal (Sam/Dean parallel S3) when Max die she'll die too, so Max doesn't let her), so she goes to bunker alone looking for help (hide from Max), start reading archives but lose patience, hope the bunker computer has easy archive, go poke, find out it's manually recently modified, go digging, restart, trigger Charlie's consciousness awake, start talking in bunker, startle TFW (subtly indicate Cas is still around & destiel)

TFW talk to Charlie for a bit, miss her, guilty, this version is uploaded before her death event (even before the whole decrypting event), so she doesn't know, it never happens to her (TFW still guilty but relieved) (TFW has to leave bunker for a while? out hunting some small things but leave bunker to them←take them out of story; also give a reason why can't just let Jack fix them)

some discussions about life form, what is life, whether Charlie should be considered dead/revived, what's this form vs soul living form, Cas to confirm her soul is indeed still in Heaven, with all memories but can't create new ones, this AI version is more alive/living; to make AI!Charlie more legit, Cas go to Heaven ask if her original soul is okay with that, soul!Charlie: "if I know anything about myself" she's ok with it, even just for curiosity about the experiment←hint for ending)

both are basically consciousness in wrong/no body (philosophic discussion of "what is life"), held together by tech/magic, just need to figure out a normal-ish body (inspired by *Cyberpunk 2077*) to become human again. Charlie suggests to make herself a twig/twine doll body too but everyone vote it down (and need her heart but they already burned). Alicia suggests to upload her own brain to bunker computer (since Charlie already know how to do it), good for backup too in case twig stop working (or to release Max as early as possible, Max already dying?/chased by demon/hellhound? twin have hellhound case?), seem no reason not to, so start the process (Max finds out Alicia is in bunker some time around this, so he comes too)

Alicia enter Charlie's sci-fi version world (visual from 2077/San Junipero), two girl time, talk in AI-type wavelength-only human-incomprehensible pitch (inspired from that post in qzone), TFW+Max amazed and continue digging books, the two girls searching the whole internet; because of isolated and bored, talking more, getting close, start have desire, want to touch physically (getting slightly more sexual or hinting that direction)

Max reuse Rowena's spell, throw Witch's ring in for full power, create two bodies for them (also release himself from spell); upload data/consciousness to the body, initially accidentally swapped, make cute fun remarks (still kiss, hug, can't wait); re-upload/swap, hold hands, "that's so much better"

"Hi" "Hi" "I'm Charlie" "Alicia" "Nice to meet you, for the first time" "I love you" "I know"

~~272. (duplicate 221)~~

### **273.【destiel】Dean is addict to angel blood**（R级）

parallel to S4 Sam addicted to demon blood or S9 Crowley addicted to human blood

imagine drinking angel blood has similar affect, gives Dean angel power, easy to get addicted

parallel to Sam&Ruby, Dean has Cas to ease the addiction, Cas wants to help him control the addiction, but Dean can't help himself, Cas doesn't have the heart to force him quit

also parallel to Sam/Ruby, the blood drinking relationship can very quickly escalate into sexual/romantic relationship, they'd have sex, blood is something very sexual-suggestive anyway

OR, during vampire Dean time, Dean doesn't change back, Cas feed him with angel blood to prevent him hurting human and still ease the thirst

### 273.5【destiel】Cas is addicted to Dean's human blood（R级）

similar to prompt 273 but reversed

can be used in prompt 335.5

### 274.【destiel】S05E17 accidental OD on pain killer

> Cas: How many should I take?
>
> Dean: You? You should probably just down the whole bottle.

but even angel has a drug tolerance, or maybe just sensitive to specific chemical that happen to be in pain killer

Cas can be affected by alcohol when he takes in too much, means drugs like pain killer can actually get to him too

what if downing the whole bottle is too much for him, he downs the whole bottle and serious drug consequence comes immediately after, Dean freak out, Cas dying (again)

(too serious stuff, probably would never write this)

### 275.【Cas】S07E01 what if God!Cas brainwash angels against him

instead of kill humans he don't like and angels against him, what if Cas brainwashes them, make them memory loss, humans become good (remove the bad/corruptive thoughts), angels obedient to him

he ends up making them loyal to *him*, not to *God*

so when he's not God, they still follow him, Castiel's fan group, kinda annoys him, still make him guilty, but so much easier than knowing he killed all of them

### 276.【Jack】what if God!Jack turn bad【WIP】

"Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely."

we're glad Jack is good for now so we're okay with him becoming God, but that's still a lot and absolute power, and given time, with that much power, he might potentially still turn bad

what if by that time Dean/Sam already in heaven, Cas as angel is assisting God!Jack and notice things are off, he has enough morality to notice some decisions are turning grey (even if Jack says he's gonna be hand off, gradually slightly he'd still be involved, so there always will be some decisions need made, always some chance to be grey/black)

Cas goes to Dean/Sam in heaven about the issue, but this time not like Chuck, they can't kill Jack, he's their son still, no matter what, they need to find a way

there should be a way to build the system without god, or make a balance

(≈prompt 327)

### 277.【Jack/Jesse】S05E06 anti-Christ keeps balance with God

demon's son & devil's son, Jack finds Jesse in Australia, bring him back to his family, the two become besties, hang out together, enjoy the life

whenever one goes bad, the other keep balance, they're the only one powerful enough for the other

what if both of them come up with a bad boy joke (just like all teen boys) and go for it, make a terrible mistake, the parents (TFW) get pissed, save the world together again

### 278.【Michean/Micifer】S05E01 Michael goes gentle/friendly on Dean

Dean would never say yes or submissive to torture/force, but he'd be agreeable if he's treated kindly, like it's for sure he wouldn't reject if Cas needs to go into him

(inspired by Frank Castle/Matt Murdock, something nice would work a hell better than bad forceful ways)

Lucifer goes easy/gentle on Nick/Vince, pretend to be their loved ones, promise to be good to them; Michael only act harshly like a dick he is, but what if he realizes that, and know Dean would say yes if he behaves like that, so he mimics Cas, help them, be kind to them, even if in the beginning is just to pretend, has to force down his own pride, but later gradually, just like Cas, he learns the beauty of humanity and start genuinely care for human, and to fight Lucifer isn't just a mission, but a way to protect humanity, then even more compassion, he wants to save Lucifer not to kill him

Dean/TFW also tries their best to turn Michael, make him less of a dick (the decade with Adam proves Michael can indeed be changed), then Dean says yes, Michael!Dean saves the world

Even better, if Lucifer experience the similar curve, Luci corrupts because of Cain's Mark, so if it's fixable, he gets better/fixed. Or better, he doesn't get better, but they still accept him again. Michael takes him back in. Luci actually kinda likes humanity stuff too, even if he doesn't admit (proof with Jack his son, he can care, even if in the beginning just pretend to be)

### 279.【destiel】《You shouldn't kiss me like this》（Lyrics）

(by Toby Keith)

You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that

'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at

We'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around

And around and around and around



They're all watching us now, they think we're fallin' in love

They'd never believe we're just friends

When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that

If you do, baby, kiss me again

### 280.【destiel】《麦克阿瑟公园》Lyrics - AU

《MacArthur Park》 by Donna Summer

MacArthur Park is melting inthe dark

All the sweet, green icing flowing down

Someone left my cake out in the rain

I don't think that I can take it

'Cause it took so long to bake it

And I'll never have that recipe again, again



I recall the yellow cooton dress

Foaming like a wave

On the ground beneath her knees

The birds like tender babies in your hands

And the old man playing Chinese checkers by the trees



There will be another song for me

And I will sing it

There will be another dream for me

Someone will bring it



I will drink the wine while it is warm

And never let you catch me looking at the sun

And after all the loves of my life

After all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one



I will take my life into my hands and I will use it

I will win the worship in your eyes and I will lose it

I will have the things that I desire

And my passion flow like rivers from the sky

And after all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one

And I'll ask myself why



(djinn's world? normal people AU? beetlejuice 2 reference)

### 285.【Dean/destiel】demon!Dean is a Green-Eyed demon

normal demon black-eyed, Crowley red-eyed, prince of Hell yellow-eyed

canon S10 demon!Dean is knight of Hell - black-eyed

what if demon!Dean is his own race of demon, and is still Green-Eyed; they thought to use eye color to identify demon state, never thought when Dean's eyes are back to green, he's still a demon, just a Green-Eyed demon

after the blood thing, thought S10 Dean is back human but he's not actually changed back

(≈ prompt 362)

### 286.【Dean/destiel/drowley】Green-Eyed demon, King of Hell

similar to above, but timeline before 401 when Dean is in Hell, Cas doesn't come to Dean in Hell (didn't get the order to do so for a long while, not until Lucifer is out and apocalypse actually begins), Dean climbs his way in Hell to the top, (temporarily) collaborate with King of Crossroad demon Crowley, Red-Eyed demon Crowley + Green-Eyed demon Dean, no moral, go out make demon deal as fun hang-out, good buddy, howl to the moon, have fun, no burden

Dean becomes the new King of Hell, know apocalypse plan, angels deliberately fail to protect 66 orders. Dean secretly try to sabotage, Dean/Crowley doesn't want Lucifer out, work privately against Lilith/Ruby, Cas actually try to prevent 66 orders (thought it's the Plan), Dean/Crowley/Cas collaborate a bit, Cage seal still broken by Sam, Lucifer out

Cas follow order to go to bring Dean back to human, Dean doesn't want to/hesitate, he can go to Earth by himself already, visited Sam, Sam still drink demon blood (S4), brothers actually bounded well

something something, S5 rewrite, still manage to put Lucifer to cage (with Sam in it?), Dean decision point: choose between Crowley (be demon)/Cas (be human) → remain demon?, remain in Hell, bc Sam is in Hell/Cage, he can see him closer, in a way keep an eye on his brother, Cas can visit anyway

(there was a similar fic, high kudo, fanfav, demon Dean+angel Cas S4/5 rewrite save the apocalypse, well-written, title?)

### 287.【destiel】在索多玛蛾摩拉受折磨的天使（R级）【WIP】

(inspired by 《[Clipped and Unbound](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1567589)》slaved angel world + ND_Tardis的《[罪恶之城](https://archiveofourown.org/works/19430962)》)

canon-divergent, rape/non-con?, graphic depiction of violence

It's a city of blasphemy. When angels arrive, the humans here have ways to enslave and torture them. Cas comes with order to punish them, end up being enslaved, torn and violated, locked down, distained. Dean is Rod in this story, citizen of Sodom and Gomorrah, despise what his neighbors do to the angels, still have awe and faith for angels. Found Cas locked in his neighbor/father's cellar, quietly secretly try to help him, release him and help him heal himself. Cas has PTSD now and guarded against all humans, (almost/already?) hurt Dean (by accident), Dean doesn't complain, Cas feel guilty. Dean's father comes back find out, more pissed at Cas, torture/punish him more (Cas thinks he deserve this one, doesn't protest like he usually would), Dean heartbroken, thinking Cas is hurt more because of him, self-blame. John almost/want to kill Cas, Dean plead not to, has to make argument saying he should be the one to handle Cas since he's hurt by the angel, John agrees, leave him be. Cas actually thinks Dean is going to punish/torture/hurt/kill him, still doesn't protest and thinks he deserve it.

Dean open his lock/chain, Cas doesn't try to flee. Dean: "You are not going to leave?" Cas: "Where to?" He's already distained by human, he's dirty now, Heaven loathe any form related to human e.g. Nephilim, he doubts if heaven would still want him in

Dean sad, Cas not understand, Dean apologize, Cas apologize back, they kiss, two wounded creature by the city of sins

God punish the city, going to destroy it, Cas hear it from angel radio, propose to take Dean away, leave the city, never look back again, Dean plead to bring Sam too, Cas agree, Dean can't find heart to ask Cas to take John too so he doesn't ask even if he know he will hate himself for it

The city is destroyed, Sam (too young to understand everything) worry about John, look back, turn into pillar of salt, Dean cry in agony, Cas self-blame he can't save Sam too, Dean doesn't blame him

Bal find Dean/Cas, has the heaven weapon in hand, empathy on Cas, mojo him clean, bring him to heaven, Cas offer Dean come to Heaven too, Dean choose live/travel alone then reincarnation (become Dean of canon verse), Cas gets "cleaned up" by Naomi (thus brainwashed, no memory, Bal remembers?)

then the two meet again in 401, feel familiar, neither remember, but somehow intuitively trust each other already; 603 run into the salt weapon again, Bal gives him a meaningful eye

### 288.【all】hunter corp in canonverse

hunter corp Dean/Sam remain in canonverse, restart hunter corp business? making monsters a globally aware thing

1513 hunter corp + 1509 The Trap AU, god die, monster become known to all human, hunter corp business become too good when monster start riot, human vs monster big fight (not just hunter), second (third?) apocalypse, they find out a way to keep monster in control, world in balance again

### 289.【destiel】Dean learns Enochian for Cas

(inspired by 《[Clipped and Unbound](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1567589)》where un-educated angels can't read written English, only Enochian, and Cas doesn't really like his name in English, it's not his name, it should be in Enochian)

can relate that

no matter how good/familiar/fluent Cas is with human language including English, it's not his native tongue, he's still more intuitively familiar with Enochian, so when in nightmare or some other intuitive moments e.g. battle warning etc., he's still using Enochian by instinct

Dean observes it and quietly takes notice, and learns Enochian for Cas

first time Dean tries to talk with Cas in spoken Enochian, Cas is surprised, Dean speaks terribly and not fluently, Cas: "what are you doing, you know I can speak English right?" Dean just want to make him feel comfortable, feel home, Cas is moved

### 290.【destiel/all】S12 rewrite: what if Amara brings all Winchesters back

what Dean wants most: the whole family together

so what if instead of only bringing Mary back (leaving John alone in Heaven), Amara brings both John and Mary back. Actually, to be thorough, also bring Henry and Samuel back, the whole big Winchester + Campbell family back

the first time everyone is back, a little similar to post-S15E20 Dean's Heaven, but Heaven on Earth, everyone gets a chance to solve their trauma/regrets, John's daddy issue, Mary's daddy issue ("your dad needs to handle his daddy issue")

still a bit of "John Winchester's A+ parenting" issue regarding Cas/Dean relationship (not necessarily established relationship, but maybe just because of trusting him too much, the way they interact, Mary already assumed, John easily assume the same), but this time destiel has grandpa and so many other family members together to solve it

bunker is going to be very crowded and noisy

and family drama is going to be horrible: have you ever seen a whole big family living together and *not* turn into big fight? classic family drama story but more comedy less trauma tragedy

Henry/Samuel in-law relationship, Henry/Mary weirdly very close father-in-law relationship, John's temper has to improve because of Henry being there

destiel maybe not even in the focus, this is about the whole family, this is every Winchester (and Campbell)

many hot-temper characters (isn't it everyone?), it might as well be the real apocalypse

### 291.【destiel】卡给丁建的颅内世界

S07E01帝卡时期附近时间线，丁不小心又快把自己弄死/快要脑死亡了（比真死还要麻烦因为不去天堂），卡把他放进颅内世界了，类似djinn's world，但是是卡给他建的，为了让他过得尽量舒服一点又不想让他察觉出来暴躁愤怒

开局丁视角感觉整个世界都是正常的，好像全都只是正常的case fic，正常的hunter life，也没有特别严重的world-ending threat，所以过得还算舒服，那些偶尔的危险也都是正常级别的——只有卡看起来异常。写的手法暗示+因为是丁的局限视角，刻意引导读者好像卡是这个世界有问题的那个，比如好像突然出现ooc动作表现，或者突然zoom out静止不动好像机器人失去信号之类（突然黑客帝国）。丁注意到了不对劲，暗中其实一直在注意卡，想要搞明白到底卡出了什么问题，把全文悬念也都引到卡身上（但是偶尔穿插潜意识暗示现实世界在外面，稍微也有点黑镜304 San Junipero的写法风格）。丁在各个case fic之间一边跟卡正常互动一边一直在调查在开始担心起来，卡以为他是对自己/这个世界有怀疑了也开始有点紧张，但其实完全方向都是错的。到后面丁卡关系进展，卡开始对这个世界走势有点失去控制，这个世界卡的zoom out其实是他不得不在外面世界离开丁去做别的事。卡逐渐意识到了自己没法做好帝卡，他甚至没法设计好一个专门给丁的世界，那就不用说建一个给所有人都理想的全世界了。到后面揭晓丁视角其实整个世界都是假的，卡放弃帝卡能力，用最后一点能力治好丁。俩人要重新讨论俩人关系（其实里世界的那个卡也都是卡本人，所以互动都是有记忆的，那些case fic对他们来说也都相当于是一起经历过的，“who said what happened in your head can't be real”），大概是有可能HE或者hopeful ending的。他们都要重新消化一下之前的事但是互相都是接纳了彼此了的，也是通过里面那些时间想明白了对彼此的感情，所以后面可以很有希望。

### 292.【destiel】S08-9 rewrite: Dean go through the demon tablet trial

the hell hound trial: Dean get to the hell hound first, kill it, go through the rest of the trials

by the third trial, they realize it will kill Dean, Cas force him to stop the trial (maybe stop him before second trial already)

bc Cas is working with Dean, he's not away with Metatron, so he's not fallen to be human

to save Dean, Cas possess him to cure him from inside

### 293.【Anna/Charlie】Charlie's guardian angel（F/F）

(inspired by actress's Instagram interaction)

canon divergent, S04-10 rewrite (Charlie/Anna POV)

both redheads, similar age, start with good friends then angel revelation?

maybe explicit, bisexual Anna, the only angel with her own body and 20y of real human life memory

If Anna has Charlie by her side when she reveals angel, maybe she can be more like Cas and stays? or break heaven's mind control? destiel parallel version but more lightheaded

If Charlie has Anna as guardian angel, then she won't die in S10, Anna will be there protect her

young dreamy Anna, journalism major college student, born Dec 1985

tech Charlie, orphaned 12y, born Celeste, 1985, same age

start from college? journalism homework find the tech savvy? pre-show history, then S04E09-10 (24y) Anna wakening up and remembering angel identity, when Anna tells Dean about love in human life, she means Charlie

Winchester+apocalypse pull Anna into the hunter/supernatural life, Charlie comes along too bc she can help, the black credit card starts, Dean/Charlie friendship starts (background destiel)

S04E21 brainwashed Cas ask Anna to meet him, Charlie asks her not to, Anna insists (good old relationship with Cas, trust him), Charlie accompanies, knocked out, witness Anna gets taken captive by other angels, Charlie asks for Winchester help, end of S04 apocalypse, Lucifer walks free

Charlie helps S05 beginning half, try to find a way to heaven, Cas gets banished from heaven so can't provide info about Anna, Charlie try suicide to get to Heaven, stopped by Dean/Cas (widow curve? Charlie too bright to be suicidal?)

S05E13 Anna is sent to trick Cas/Dean to kill Mary/John, Charlie comes along, try to reason with Anna, Anna controlled by Naomi, got the command to kill Charlie but she can't, break free from the control (~S08E17 destiel), not killed by Michael, all come back to current timeline

S05-10 Anna/Charlie stay around Winchesters to save worlds, close to them but not all the time, in the life but has life of their own, hunt on their own, help when they can, a little similar to Jody and girls, will know the girl band too → some time around it, get married?

S10 Charlie help with Dean's Mark of Cain, Anna's there too, protect her when the Frankensteins track her down, crack the Mark without Charlie dead

go into S10-15 as they are, happy ever after S15 finale (Anna help save Cas back from the Empty?)

Charlie/Dean's heaven, their angels are all there, one big happy family

### 294.【Charlie】what if there are still 2 Charlies at S10E22（F/F，R级）

（自性恋？）

(fix-it, save Charlie)

what if Charlie didn't come back from Oz until around S10 end, good Charlie jump in helping them find the Book of the Damned and decrypt it, dark Charlie guard both of them to not be killed

dark Charlie super good at weapons, fighting, etc., not morally constrained, not afraid of killing

(from S10E11) dark Charlie relate to Dean's violent side, meaning if dark Dean can slaughter the whole Steins, dark Charlie is very likely good enough to take them down as well (with some wounds/near death experience so need to be saved by good Charlie)

good Charlie and dark Charlie save each other and kill Steins and decrypt the Book, saved Dean, and Charlie doesn't die, and Charlie realize the person she love-hate the most is herself, not so eager to put her other self back inside her, maybe even explicit? can feel both self's feeling, would be tempting to try the explicit experience and have a date and more with the other self

### 295.【destiel/denny】《Purgatory》（Lyrics）

(by Feuerschwanz)

The Limbo is the place for the unbaptised and the pagans

Without the portal of the faith

That they embrace

Their souls will always be forsaken

For all the sinners full of lust

The second circle does them just

In the third in hail and frostbites they will fry



We're burning in the Purgatory

We sinners, we are saints

For here in hell we are unholy

Swimming in a sea of flames

Our hearts will burn in Purgatory

Blazing blood runs through our veins

And there's no turning back

From the Purgatory



The greedy roast with pope and cardinals into damnation

In the fifth the river Styx flows the wrathful through eternal tribulation

The heretics lie in the sixth, eternal flames them burning

In the seventh bloody murderers are damned



Abandon all hope you who enter here

Deceivers wait in Number eight, nine's for treachery

Where Lucifer awaits the Judgement Day

### 296.【destiel】purgatory portal: portal of the faith

inspired by 295 lyrics

Benny's quote: "I thought you guys are all about faith" Cas: "Not particularly"

What if the portal in Purgatory *is* portal of faith, the portal literally doesn't exist when Dean wasn't thinking about leaving and only focusing on looking for Cas

The portal only forms when he finds Cas and ready to leave, having faith that all of them can go home together, he can bring Cas home

### 297.【destiel】I wouldn't ask you to trust me if I always tell the truth

inspired by DW 11/Amy

"Trust me" "But you don't always tell the truth" "I wouldn't ask you to trust me if I always tell the truth"

post-S06E19

explains why Dean still trust/forgive Cas after betrayals and lies in S06, vice versa

### 298.【all】但丁《神曲》crossover

the "real" Hell as 但丁 visualizes *is* the hell in spn when they (Dean/Cas/Sam) go there, is what Dean/Cas sees when they meet and before Cas saving Dean

canon divergent from after S03E16 and before S04E01

### 299.【destiel】"No tree can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell"

quote from Carl Jung: "No tree can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell"

saw a painting in Solvang's art gallery too with same quote

quite adequate for pretty much everyone in story, especially Dean and Cas

might can be used as a prompt or foreword for a destiel story where they have to get a bit dark to do good

or a art gallery-related story, one of them is the artist that painted the painting with tree and that quote?

### 300.【destiel】S06E06/S15E20 Dean will never be happy when Sam's alive

S06E06 Lisa: "As long as he's in your life, you're never gonna be happy."

what if that's the truth, the real fact of the world coming from Chuck (not just the Goddess of Truth)

what if after S15E20, it's Sam died in the barn in the vampire case, Dean lives on

would Dean allow himself be happy? apple-pie life? Cas comes down for him again?

(has read some fic like that somewhere, Dean lives on but will never stop mourning Sam, in some post-S5 setting where Sam doesn't come back; similar idea but post-S15)

### 301.【all】S09E02 Monsters with good PR

Angels are monsters with good PR, other monsters evolve to be more clever gradually (or Chuck makes them that way) and start working on good PR with human as well. Vampire/werewolf already start shooting movies/books (Twilight), skin walkers make ads in human society about how dogs are humans' best friends, shapeshifter become good actors as well entering entertainment industry, demons go into sales advertising the fair deals.

The monsters live with humans together in peace/balance (?)

### 302.【all】S09E05 Dogs are on Earth because...

"And by the way, as an honorary dog, there's something you should know. Dogs aren't really man's best friend. I know it sounds like a conspiracy theory, but the real reason we were put here was to..."

why are dogs really on Earth?

### 303.【destiel】 S05E04 what if Cas/Dean infected by Croatoan

（inspired by 《The Last of Us》）

如果14卡或者14丁或者主世界丁感染了僵尸病毒会怎么样，会不会被放弃，会不会变eldritch

或者直接在僵尸宇宙，像最后生还者那种既视感，会怎么样

### 304.【destiel】S05E13 Dean gets killed and scattered all over the universe, Cas search for all his pieces to save him

S05E13 establish rule of resurrection:

> Castiel: Even if you could kill Sam, Satan would just bring him back to life.
>
> Anna: Not after I scatter his cells across the universe. They'll never find him. Not all of him.

([ref](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Resurrection): In order for someone to be resurrected, the practitioner must have all -- or at least most of -- the subject's molecular components available. Anna planned to spread Sam's cells all across the universe in order to stop him from being resurrected.)

Dean is killed and scattered all across the universe, Cas go find every piece of him when no one think it's possible. in all the space & time

(Lucifer's effort to kill Dean, prevent Michael takes his true vessel?)

### 305.【destiel】S05E04 endverse becomes real canon

S05E04 endverse timeline becomes real canon, what Dean did in canon-canon doesn't divert it, the world still moves toward that, Sam gets possessed by Lucifer, Cas becomes 14!Cas, angels leave, Dean doesn't say yes to Michael, the world occupied by Croatoan virus. Dean becomes 14!Dean, meets 09!Dean. Lucifer kills Dean (like in one of Chuck's AU world), but the world doesn't end after Dean's death. The world moves on, 14!Cas survives, 09!Dean & 14!Cas kill/lock Lucifer? Michael does something? Dean somehow gets resurrected, 14!Cas finds a way to save him. Sam is probably back in control over Lucifer again.

### 306.【destiel】time travel save Mary from the fire without paradox

(inspired by DW S01E08 Rose time travel to save her father)

Dean asks Cas to bring him (maybe Sam too) back to the night of the fire, pretend to be a fireman, save Mary from the fire, fake her death, hide her somewhere, manage to work around paradox. So they still believed Mary dead their whole growing up, but she's not actually.

for John to have some more closure, Mary let him in the hunter world, let him know about demons instead of him finding out by himself from Missouri

what John did to the boys growing up, half is because he's scared of Sam's demon blood, he probably half wants to save Sam, half wants him dead by himself without John do anything (explains that case he uses Sam as bait, also explains he force Dean to become soldier to protect/save Sam)

### ~~307.【destiel】S05E08 Cas becomes impala（R级）【done】~~

S05E08 the TV episode

Gabe turns Cas into impala (instead of Sam) and doesn't give up the joke for a longer while

potentially could turn into explicit

≈ might related prompt 81

meanwhile Sam is trapped in a AU channel world, time flow differently, Gabe displays the next ten years for him, so by the time Dean and car!Cas find him, Sam is in S15E20 after Dean's death, locking bunker for the last time, broken and lonely

turns out everything since this in canon is only in Sam's bubble world created by Gabe (with some reference to real world, so is Eileen real?), it's sad and heartbroken for Sam but now they get a second chance to do things right again, with some known knowledge e.g. don't let Sam's soul in Cage or Chuck is God or what's in Purgatory or what's Empty like (might just be Gabe's imagination tho)

hopeful ending

### 307.5【destiel】S05E08 Cas becomes impala（《Unchanging Channels》后续）

After the events in 《[Unchanging Channels](https://archiveofourown.org/works/67516816)》, they'll still have to fix the car!Cas issue, seek Gabe out, send him a card, kick his ass, and continue stopping the Apocalypse in S5, figuring out how to handle Michael/Lucifer, save the world

Title can be: 《How to stop the Apocalypse and save the world (and have a relationship) as a car》

all of them have all the knowledge from canon S5-S15, now they're back S05E08, whole show rewrite (but mostly S5 rewrite)

Eileen and Miracle are real & alive, established Sam/Eileen, near established Dean/Cas

### 308.【destiel】S06E17 Cas kill Atropos

Cas has the option of killing Atropos and all destiny sisters, canon version choose to let them go. What if Cas is actually desperate and crazy enough to decide why not just see it through and do it all. So Bal actually kill Atropos from behind. Now they have to deal with two pissed-off destiny sisters before going back to their main season task. Knowing it's them, no doubt they'd succeed in the killing, and Dean/Sam would have to help. But might come consequence so bad that one or some of them have to die again (most likely Cas, for going too far)

### 309.【all】S06 what if instead of Samuel, Cas bring Mary back

As it turns out, it's Cas bring Samuel back from Heaven to help him and Crowley to find Purgatory, because Samuel is a really good hunter. So is Mary. So what if, instead of Samuel, Cas brings Mary back. Mary hunts with soulless Sam, see Dean live a normal life, etc.

S06 rewrite, mimicking S12

### 310.【destiel】哥谭AU

inspired by Misha的双面人在毁容之前穿GCPD警服造型，跟Jensen在Countdown里穿LAPD警服的侦探造型很配

哥谭AU，双警探，单黑化，适合混乱邪恶

### 311.【Cas中心+micifer】Michael+Lucifer has their 1v1 inside Cas

from S11 we already know Cas/Jimmy is a powerful vessel strong enough to host Lucifer, so S5 Lucifer wouldn't have to focus so much on Nick/Sam, he has other options, e.g. starting working on Jimmy/Cas since then

similarly we can set/assume Dean/John/Adam aren't the only strong vessel for Michael, he doesn't have to stick with Dean, maybe Cas/Jimmy can host him too, so Michael shifts to work on Jimmy/Cas too

so S5 becomes Michael+Lucifer both focus on torturing/persuading Cas, in the end both occupy Cas, the apocalypse essentially is them fighting, they have their fight inside Cas, Cas suffers, but world is saved

### 312.【destiel】双流浪汉AU

灵感来自jenmish都穿破洞T恤

~~313. (duplicate 83.5)~~

### 314.【destiel】blind Dean

(inspired by 快乐王子的blind Happy Prince，夜魔侠，镇魂巍澜盲眼时期)

Dean is blind (can be temporary, a curse, a disease, demon's doing, etc.)

Cas can't heal him (maybe power limited, or human!Cas time), but takes the duty to take care of him, be his eyes, walk him around

Dean holds Cas's arms all the time, intuitively reach out to him, look for him for touches, the first thing he'd do when he wakes up etc.

Dean has a lot more needs for touching, Cas lets him touch him, for sense of security

(突然想起好像看见过一篇类似的，[《My Eyes Are An Ocean》](https://archiveofourown.org/works/153889)，tone非常calm，end with Cas taking out his own eyes to give them to Dean, so Dean can see now and his eyes are blue, he freaks out a little. Cas: "I can heal myself." so of course he'd give him his eyes. 写得非常好)

### 315.【all/destiel】时间流速换算公式

从S4已知：人间1个月=地狱10年（Sam在地面上4个月，Dean在地狱40年）

从S8已知：人间1年=炼狱1年（Sam在地面上1年，Dean/Cas在炼狱1年）

从S15已知：天堂1分钟=人间10年（Dean在天堂4分钟（carry on my wayward son播放时长），Sam在地面上40年（40岁到大概80岁））

所以时间流速，人间和炼狱同速，地狱最慢，天堂最快

所以天堂1分钟=人间10年=炼狱10年=地狱1200年，no wonder the souls and demons in Hell are so twisted

提问：地狱不同地方时间流速是否也会不同，Dean在Pit的体验感是40年，如果他在Cage或者Hell的其他地方，是不是会更长/更短

### 316.**【Ruby/Lilith】demon lovers sacrifice for Apocalypse（F/F）**

(bisexual Ruby)

the whole s4 we thought Ruby was working alone without collaborating with other demons and working together with Sam to go against Lilith, but actually she's all along working with Lilith, and Lilith has always been preparing her self-sacrifice to break Lucifer free

so imagine Ruby's intimate moments with Sam were all fake (or it can be real too, she's a demon after all, she might be bi, she enjoyed the physical interaction with Sam), and every time they finish, Ruby disappears, she's actually going back to Hell to Lilith's bed to "clean herself up", whining about how long that's going to take, how much she didn't actually want to be with Sam, only to use Sam as a tool for the Apocalypse, she's tired of pretending, she wanted Hell victory and she rode onto Earth with Lilith, all she really wanted is to be openly with Lilith

Lilith loved being with her too, the two of them might be in the middle of having their way of fun (sex or any other way they like), but then Lilith tells her she's not going to make it to after Apocalypse, she's not gonna survive. Ruby surprised, it's the first time she knew the truth as well, want to find another way, told Lilith they don't have to do this, don't have to break Lucifer free, she's just fine the way Hell is, ruled by Lilith already, they could just stay where they are, continue the old life like they had for the past thousand years

Lilith is determined, Lilith was the first demon created by Lucifer, he's like her father, she's devoted to save her father, Ruby heartbroken, hate Lilith not telling her from the beginning and asking her to help kill her, Lilith: "Honey, I'm a demon." "If you ever loved me, if you can really know what love feels like, then help me do this one thing I ask you, let Sam Winchester kill me." Lilith hates the fact that she's the last seal that her father can't be freed as well.

Lilith to Ruby: "Watch the new world for me, command the army when they rise to the Earth, conquer Heaven for me. That's the world we fought so long for. I want you in a better world, a world led by Lucifer, where you can walk the Earth whenever you want, don't have to be afraid of angels or hunters. You can be safe finally. Isn't that what we always wanted?"

Ruby all tears but agreed, lead to S4 finale, Ruby lure Sam to the last seal, told him the truth last moment that Lilith *is* the final seal. Sam stabs Ruby, Ruby starts laughing, meeting eyes with the also-dying Lilith, saying her goodbye with eyes. Lilith quiet (in their demon mental channel?) "No! Why are you doing this?" Ruby could have escaped & left the scene, wouldn't get killed when their goal is reached, wouldn't have to die, so it's almost like she deliberately wanted to die, which is exactly what she did.

when Lucifer is coming out of the Cage and Sam/Dean got saved by Chuck, Ruby crawls toward Lilith, holding her hands, "I don't want to live in a world without you. That would be the real Hell. So I'm coming with you. Wherever you're going, I'm coming with you."

They go to the Empty together and sleep there together. Ruby gets woke up by Cas in S15, that's when she realized they were both in Empty and sleeping, Lilith right by her because they arrive here basically the same time. Ruby wake Lilith up, the two reunite in Empty, hugging. (double MCD but sorta HE?)

### 317.【Meg/Ruby/Lilith】Meg/Lilith teach Ruby how to make out with Sam（F/F，R级）

(Meg is still early season blond form, personal favorite vessel of hers) (bisexual Ruby)

Meg is the first among them to get topside and walk the Earth. She tells the others what it's like to be walking on the Earth, they get jealous.

Ruby longs for it, she does have more human emotion than most other demons, she has more feelings and emotions, she gets reminded when she's human (she's not lying when telling Winchesters she was once human and most demons she knew were too).

so the reason why S4 Ruby comes to Earth is totally because of S1-3 Meg. Meg might show her the "human" way of fun physically (having sex), that's how S4 Ruby gets so familiar with the motion on Sam because she had experience with Meg first. But gets unfamiliar when she realizes it's different with male body/vessel

Meg possess male body to teach her how to lure Sam? Lilith gets involved too? because Lilith tried to lure Sam too once, so she knows how to as well.

Meg/Lilith teach Ruby how to make out with Sam, early season female demon orgy, threesome

### 318.【destiel】S15E20 Cas leaves Heaven the day before Dean arrives

inspired by 《[Walk This World Alone](https://archiveofourown.org/works/67965846)》, write into full-length angst, has permission already

post-1518/1520, Cas comes back Empty, decides to go to Earth to live as human with Dean for the rest of their lives. only to miss Dean's death. Cas becomes human and has to live his life on Earth alone and all the time Dean's in Heaven

Cas would have suicidal thoughts, wanting to be with Dean earlier. Dean would be in Heaven, building a cabin of their own. a life long pining and longing and waiting, so much loneliness. and eventually they reunite in Heaven, both as human souls. like 1520 Dean/Sam reunite, it's Dean/Cas: "Cas" "Hello, Dean"

(≈ prompt 133.5)

### 319.【Dean】S14E10 Rocky's bar, Dean's dream come true

Dean's real happiness, one thing he always wanted to do and wants nothing more, is to have a shabby bar of his own and serves and makes drinks with a hot waitress like Pamela, and kill vampires and hunt when need to (when they come to the bar and look for trouble)

There must be a version of universe out there that Dean's living his dream life, actually for real having this bar. He'd be like new Ellen/Jo, Rocky's bar like the new Roadhouse, hunter's bar and info center

Cas could stay with him, serving in the bar (so could be destiel too)

### 320.【all】Death reaps God

S5 old Death: (paraphrase) "Even God can die. In the end I'll reap God too."

but in the end, God didn't die, Death died. It's not right, it's not natural.

world with God but without Death is going to have issue, how to fix it?

Jack has to function as Death instead of God? they do something to kill Billie and bring old Death back in s15, so Death can reap God, the world has no God, s15 complete rewrite but HE?

### 321.【destiel】why can't Dean hear Cas's true voice

S04E01 Cas: (paraphrase) "Certain people, special people, can hear my true voice. I thought you're one of them. Clearly I'm mistaken, I'm sorry."

Jimmy can hear Cas's true voice. (S04E19?) so Jimmy is special people. Cas just assumed Dean is special and their profound bond can let him hear Cas, why can't Dean hear him?

theory: devout man (like Jimmy) can hear Cas, man who doesn't have faith/doesn't believe angel exist (like S4 Dean) can't. Once Dean accepts Cas, believes in angel, he can too

(≈ prompt 88)

### 322.【Rowena】S14E14 Rowena is a powerful vessel for Michael

Rowena is a powerful vessel strong enough for Apocalypse!Michael, probably also strong enough for main Michael

S4/5 Michael *could* try to possess Rowena? Rowena might say yes too?

what will happen if S5 finale is Rowena!Michael vs Sam!Lucifer? bond between Rowena/Sam needs slow burn to build, so might rewrite S5 with Crowley/Rowena curve moving ahead, merge S10/14 with S5, change S5 finale

### 323.【destiel】S09E03 what if Ezekiel didn't bring Cas back

(original post on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/junesirius/784059387464515584))

Here is what's in the script:

> **April:** Are you negotiating with me, Castiel?
>
> THE DOOR-- BAM! It's kicked in!
>
> **Dean:** Cas!
>
> Sam and Dean rush in. And APRIL PLUNGES THE BLADE DEEP INTO CAS'S CHEST!
>
> Sam charges her with her blade but she WAVES A HAND and BLASTS SAM BACK AGAINST A WALL. His blade goes flying.
>
> Dean dives for Sam's knife but April BLASTS HIM AGAINST ANOTHER WALL (in Castiel's direction)!
>
> **April:** This girl is popular with all the boys.
>
> Dean, his back to April, pulls himself up using Castiel's chair. Cas is gasping for air. They share a look as April turns for Dean.
>
> Dean, unseen, yanks the blade from Castiel's chest... and as April raises her hand to smite him he turns and JAMS THE BLADE INTO HER CHEST! Her eyes and mouth fly open as she FLARES OUT AND DIES. Dean tries to regain his senses. Sam is slumped groggily against the wall, just beginning to come to.
>
> Dean turns back to Cas. Cas is motionless, eyes open, empty. He is dead.
>
> **Dean:** Cas...
>
> The reality sinks in. The loss is more staggering than April's grip. Dean is overcome with grief.
>
> **Dean:** Cas... (then) No... No... No...
>
> Behind him, Sam rises to his feet. His EYES FLASH and we realize, he's EZEKIEL now. Dean's still in shock.
>
> **Dean:** (helpless) Sammy. Cas is gone.
>
> But Sam/Ezekiel looks completely calm. He approaches Cas, draws his hand over Cas's wounds. We see Sam/Ezekiel strain from the effort but the wounds heal. He places other hands over Cas's chest. AND EZEKIEL STRUGGLES, THE EFFORT IS ENORMOUS. Cas's eyes blink, and he gasps for air. The LIGHT INSTANTLY LEAVES EZEKIEL'S EYES. Sam's legs buckle and he slumps back, sinking onto the futon.
>
> **Castiel:** (dazed) Dean?
>
> **Dean:** Yeah, man.
>
> He hugs Cas, then quickly uses the blade to cut open the zipties.
>
> **Castiel:** And Sam.
>
> Dazed himself, Sam gives his head a shake to clear it, then stares at Cas.
>
> **Sam:** Wow. Is it good to see you.
>
> He hugs Cas. His hands now freed, wrists raw, Cas feels them, tries to sort things out.
>
> **Dean:** Cas man, don't ever do this again.
>
> **Castiel:** Alright. (then) But I'm confused.
>
> He stares down at his chest, feels the flesh.

So all we have in the script is as simple as: "Dean is overcome with grief" and trembling "Cas... No... No... No..." Everything else is the beauty of performance.

And just noticed from the script: Cas was still alive when Dean removes the blade from his chest, he was gasping for air and they share a look. And by the time Dean kills April, Cas is dead. Can't help thinking, is it the move of removing the blade from the deep chest wound that killed Cas, because wounds like that, probably the blade is the only thing stop the bleeding at the moment. Now thinking what if Ezekiel didn't resurrect Cas and Dean rethink the event and realizes probably he's the one that finalize human Cas's death because he was too eager and focused on killing April... God, S9 would probably just be as bad as S13 before Tombstone.

### 324.【you】real life exorcism

You are a Supernatural fan watching the show too many times and love it too much. One day, you suddenly on a whim want to learn the exorcism they are using in the show, just feeling it'd be cool to be able to recite a large pose of Latin. You start chanting them, and suddenly some black smoke comes out from your laptop that kept breaking down, or your printer that kept jamming papers, or your car that kept having weird noises. Now you realize all these times, they are not bad quality products, they're haunted.

### 325.【Dean】= Oedipus (kill father, marry mother)

dead dove warning, heavily majorly morally totally messed up, ultimately ultra disturbing

Dean-centered

accidental unaware time travel (or tricked to do so by some major freaking sick villain angel/pagan god/worse Chuck than current/Lucifer, e.g. Chuck be like, "you don't like fratricide? you think it's bad enough? you know what can be better than that? patricide and incest. you don't like Christian style story, fine, try Greek")

Dean got time transported or John/Mary got time transported, for some reason and something majorly disturbing and wrong happened, Dean killed John and married/violated Mary (without recognizing either of them)

(not causing grandpa paradox because original timeline baby Dean was already born)

Dean would kill himself

could turn into or add little destiel element: Cas is assigned to mess up with Dean but takes pity on him, saves Dean, prevents his suicidal attempt or brings him back, wipes everyone's memory, puts everyone back to the right timeline, no timeline-wise wrong ever done, as far as anyone concerned it never happened, not even Dean remember (or buried memory), but Cas remembered, and he doesn't judge Dean for that (Chuck's effort to make Dean do the worst thing possible trying to make Cas despise and leave Dean?)

### 326.【Cas】《Wednesday》style but Thursday (xover?)

(very vague unsure, weird idea)

just the way Cas is connected to Thursday, and Wednesday season 2 is just on, "Wednesday" can be a real character name, so maybe "Thursday" also can, and somehow related to Cas

maybe "Wednesday" crossover, similar magic school world setting but dark fantasy AU

or sort of like what I did with "Life of Blue" where Cas *is* Blue, and now it can be Cas *is* Thursday, he literally *is* a day of the week, just exist *as* the day, can be destiel

(≈ prompt 330)

### **327.【destiel】S15E18/20 Jack made deal with Empty to save Cas, destiel save Jack**【WIP】

Jack had to make a deal with Empty to bring Cas back, because God has no power in Empty. That's why he's not as strong as he should be as God after that, that's why he couldn't and didn't bring Cas to Dean after he saved Cas, even if he knew perfectly well how important Cas is to Dean and vice versa and wouldn't keep Deann miserable for five years alone.

The deal ripped Jack off his feelings and emotions. (Jack hesitated, Empty: "You think your feelings and emotions are more important than Castiel? You can leave him here sleep forever then, keep your little feelings." So Jack did it.)

He's become cold and distant, not evil, just neutral, stop caring, kinda like soulless time. Cas comes back as Angel and has to live in Heaven, because Jack made a new rule, no angel is allowed to go to Earth again, not even Cas is allowed, not even when Cas heard Dean pray to him. Cas tries to tell Jack he has to go, Jack doesn't get touched by feelings or his reasoning, that's when Cas notices Jack is off, the old Jack would understand.

So Cas breaks Jack's (new God's) rule (he's always the angel that breaks the rule, whoever's rule it is, be it Chuck or Jack as God), and sneaks down to Earth to reach out to Dean, let Dean know he's still alive but they have God problem again, but not to kill him, but to save him. Cas asks for Dean's help to save Jack, let him have feeling again, showing him feelings and love.

In the end it must be how Jack sees the love between them and get changed again, made him feel again. Jack becomes the old Jack.

In between the saving, because Jack would do what he thinks is the right thing to do, and since Cas does break his explicit rule to go down to the Earth, he'd punish Cas by locking him up. So briefly after seeing Cas again, Dean loses him again, has to figure out a way to figure out he's locked down and has to go up there to bust him out of Heaven jail and two of them save Jack together. (in order to go to Heaven, Dean might have to die again. temporary MCD unavoidable, but in the end, after Jack comes back, he can send them both back down to Earth to continue living)

(≈ prompt 276, 377)

### 328.【destiel】S04E02 "I dragged you out of Hell. I can throw you back in."

S4 timeline, when Dean is being too defiant, Heaven orders Cas to throw Dean back in to Hell, just to torture him more, to teach him lessons, to force him to listen to Heaven and be a good vessel

Cas can't do it.

so he really can't "throw him back in" even though he threatened Dean with that. It's a total bluff

### 328.5【destiel】S04E02 Cas throws Dean back to Hell

maybe because at that time Cas isn't free-will enough, not changed by Dean enough, might already have some doubt but not enough to fully rebel against Heaven, probably because it's not really life-threatening enough to fully wake Cas up

Cas is ordered to do that by Heaven and he obeys.

maybe Cas is even tasked personally to torture Dean, he might beat Dean up a bit (like S08E17), and Dean would beg him to wake up because he needs him, and Cas rebels then

or maybe instead of throwing him to Hell, Cas throws Dean into a Hell-like Heaven pocket dimension

maybe after Cas throws Dean back to Hell, Dean's evil demon dark side is awaken, he becomes more powerful than Cas expected, Dean turns dark and overpowers Cas and tortures Cas instead (≈ prompt 268)

### 329.【all】S01E01 first version pilot AU

in EK's first version S01E01 pilot draft (see some notes [here](https://junesirius.github.io/2025/08/01/SPN-Earliest-draft-of-Pivot)), it's so much darker than canon pilot, where Sam doesn't grow in hunter life, Dean only hunts last two years, Mary died in a car accident (demon involved) when they're 9 and 13, John ditched them completely to hunt the demon, Sam/Dean don't grow in hunter life

continue rewrite the canon from there

### 330.【destiel】fantasy AU: normal human Dean gets admitted into magic school, roommate angel Cas

original prompt: see Constantine prompt 9

fantasy world AU where magic and magical creatures are real

Dean is a normal human being without any special power, but gets admitted into the magic creature school, his roommate is angel Cas. Dean thinks the school made mistake to admit him, all other classmates are like centaurs, witches, Cthulhu, etc.

Dean wants to leave school but something happened, Cas needs his help or something, Dean ends up staying to help him, and when he's given the option to leave again, he decides to stay. He starts learning magic classes, difficult, but Cas helps him.

somewhat like high school/teen/campus romance

(≈ prompt 326)

### 331.【Crowley】S08E23 human!Crowley

what if they succeed in converting Crowley into a human

maybe not as third trial, now that they learn this knowledge, they can convert any demon to human (why didn't they ever do it again since S8? if Sam did it again he'd die again?), so they changed Crowley

demon living as a human using the same vessel is similar to human's, but also weird, bc demon used to be human before their death, they'd have memory of what's it like to be human and have a body of their own, and now it's a different body, might feel jarring. so it might take Crowley a while to readjust to his vessel/body.

### 332.【Jack】S08E22 Nephilim can see angel's halo

the Nephilim in S08E22 that Cas has to kill as 1st angel tablet trial tells them she can see their halos, she knows what they are. Which means Jack can see angels' halos too, which means every time Jack looks at Cas or Gabe, he'd see their halos. The first time Jack meets Cas, he'd see his halo and knows immediately (before Dean introduce them) that this is the angel the Winchesters trust to bring to bunker, so he already knows he's Cas. Later when they run into other angels/Lucifer/Michael, he knows they're angels too immediately. just part of his ability

### 333.【Mick Davies】S8 what if BMOL arrived already and Mick is the one taking the trials

What if BMOL already arrived at the beginning of S8 and they work with angel/demon tablets and Heaven/Hell trials, Mick Davies is converted by the Winchesters and so happened to be the one goes through the trials to shut the Hell gate and dies. The Winchesters just need to support him, and at the end of all events, mourn him, but the Hell is shut, no more big bad after this. World-ending crisis solved, TFW go home.

(It feels almost always, their biggest challenge and dilemma is always the sacrifice of the Winchesters (and Castiel), and they always struggle about sacrifice and death decisions. What if it doesn't have to be their burden, it can be shared and taken by others (sorry Mick), the show might should be renamed to "Mick Davies" instead of "Winchesters", but at least for once, they get to solve their problem and finish what they wanted, and world in peace, no more monsters and demons, and that's exactly what everyone hoped for. For once, they get to live the life and enjoy the world that others sacrifice to build for them. In this story, they are not the main focus or hero, they're the supporters, the side-kicks, Mick Davies is the hero. But Mick needs them to be there for him to make up his mind, to rebel BMOL, to have his own free will to sacrifice for the world (and for Dean). Might end up become a parallel version of Cas again.)

### 334.【all/destiel】S08E23 they closed Hell but realize Hell has a reason to exist

(inspired by prompt 333)

What if, say they get what they wanted, Sam goes through all three trials and doesn't die (maybe even purified of his demon blood, become fully normal human for the first time since 6-month-old), Hell gate is closed once and for all (except for Crowley), but they realize it's not all-good that no more demon on Earth. Just like when S12 it's breaking the balance to wipe all the monsters from Earth, Hell needs to exist to bring the balance for Heaven.

When Hell is closed and no more demons on Earth, they may initially think everything is good and quiet and safe and happy. But soon something happened to angels, some consequence happening to angels due to the imbalance, they realize they *need* Hell to exist, they *need* the demons to run around the Earth and they *need* the hunting life to hunt the demons (but not wipe them out clean). Maybe angels become the big bad guys now, half the angels turn evil and become the new demons, and even more difficult to handle than the original demons. They'd rather have demons around and angels stay angels. (That's the real reason why Chuck damn 1/3 of the angels to Hell with Lucifer, they need the 2:1 ratio balance; and with Hell closed, half the remaining angels fall and transform, making Heaven/Hell 1:1 ratio, it's going to be new Apocalypse but with basically all angels (Apocalypse but Civil War))

So they need to work with Crowley (and a few angels) to reopen the Hell gate. And Dean never thinks he'd do something like this.

What happened to Cas during all these? Remain angel? Or overpowered by the natural order, affected by the transform, and become one of the fallen angel and later demon?

They have to save Heaven/Hell/Earth, and they have to save Cas.

### **335.【destiel】Cas has fallen all the way to Hell and becomes demon!Cas**

(inspired by prompt 334)

maybe because of the S04E01 siege when saving Dean, or other times he has to go to Hell, Cas is affected by something in the Hell, and "all that has been to Hell remains in Hell", he becomes unclean, and his grace fails bit by bit (or quickly), and eventually showing demon signs, demon eyes, demon wings, and ultimately turn into a black-eyed demon.

They panic, notice signs and doesn't know what to do. Or could fast-forward/jump start, directly start the story with Cas being a demon, trace back to figure out why or how, and the transformation process that he undertakes alone. Painful, lonely, more self-loath, self-punishment behavior.

But never evil, he's basically still Cas, kinda like Crowley, good-hearted, actually doesn't have much change all things considered, except for the black eyes. At most a bit more mischievous and very slightly moral ambiguous. (Meg is a decent, good-hearted demon too later. Kinda like later season Meg. could add a little Meg/Crowley teasing Cas? teach him how to be demon, what to watch out, salt/iron/holy water) He even still has wings, or even fixed his broken wings (if it's post-S8 divergent), but he knows the white feathers are black now. He's utterly disgusted by his own wings, his own everything. Might even has some suicidal attempt, but stopped by Dean at last moment, or those attempts fail to kill him, or he does succeed and Dean has to go looking for him and resurrecting him from Empty. He has to continue exist as demon.

(somewhat like Ma'lak Box MoC!Cas → prompt 335.5; can include prompt 273.5)

Maybe the "not evil" part is only the beginning, when Cas still can have enough self-control, have consciousness, have good-heart, but it's a losing battle. The change is still happening underway, making his heart more black, hard, cold-blooded, blood-thirsty, brutal, cruel, by each day. They notice it, try hard to keep Cas on human/angel good side, reason with him to see the good choice, be good, be kind. Because if Cas loses it, he'd fully, completely, irreversibly become a demon. Maybe they find some solution, but it's like newly-turned vampire/werewolf reverse spell, it would only work if he doesn't cross some last line. Cas is losing control and painful, and Dean/everyone is trying their best to help him.

And maybe Cas still loses it, or something really bad happened. Maybe he attacks Dean with his demon-controlled darkened mind, remembering the harm and pain Dean does to him. Cas accuses Dean, Dean is too guilty to resist, and Cas (accidentally or forcefully?) kills Dean (≈ "Into the Fire" MoC!Dean, kills Cas when controlled, heavy angst). Cas comes back to himself briefly and pains too much, and turns completely to a demon in his heartbroken moment.

have to figure out a way to turn Cas back and save Dean again, maybe Cas doesn't care anything anymore and goes to Heaven to find Dean, which should burn him alive and kill him (which he doesn't mind and thinks he actually deserves it), which end up purifying him and cure him. And the solution is basically because of the love he has for Dean is too strong, demonization process is stripping out the emotions, but love is not an emotion, not just a thread of feeling, it's everything, it's integrated into him, so strong and focused and pure that it becomes the spark that weave the rest of his consciousness back and gets rid of the demonness. So it's not Heaven that purifies the demon, it's seeing Dean when he's in Heaven and the willingness to self-sacrifice for him that heals/reverse-changes him.

The two of them go back to Earth together again. HE.

(≈ prompt 362, 388)

### **335.5【destiel】S15E09 MoC!Cas becomes demon!Cas**【WIP】

inspired by 335, the turning to evil part is like Ma'lak Box MoC!Cas → prompt 48

maybe the whole "turning to demon" is because of MoC, Cas died when he still has MoC and resurrected by Mark and becomes a demon

somewhere in the process there must be one plot he beats the shit out of Dean and almost kills Dean, just for the S10E22's sake

one solution to help him stay human, similar to demon trial Crowley, human blood can purify demon, so Dean tries to purify demon!Cas with his blood, making Cas very openly addicted to Dean's blood and express love

some talk about putting him to Ma'lak Box, divergent from S15E09 monster ending because Dean doesn't put Cas into Ma'lak Box, they won't end up becoming vampires, MoC!Cas help smite so many monsters, he's more powerful/strong than usual (similar to S05E04 Dean seeing the AU ending if he doesn't say yes to Michael, the world becomes that, but his takeaway is to not distance Sam; so S15E09 Sam's takeaway from the AU ending, is they don't put Cas into Ma'lak Box, they'll help him, they can win this monster ending, at least die trying)

to release the Mark Dean has to do the spell and kill Cas, what if the timing is off, they rely on Mark to resurrect Cas then to remove Mark

potential solution: split and transfer the Mark to all living souls, the whole human race everyone takes a piece to lock God away, maybe be a little darker and living longer (still morally ambiguous? not all human sign up for this, they're playing God to make the decision for whole human race, distain the whole human race basically, and they don't know it would work before they try, too much risk, they might end up killing all humans, but the alternative is all monster killing all human, practically the same risk; need to think if there's a better solution)

### 336.【Crowley】good souls go to Heaven, good demons too

(inspired by 335)

good souls belong to Heaven, and self-sacrifice is considered good, so after Crowley and Meg self-sacrifice (S08E17, S12E23), and since demons are basically still souls (as established to be similar to ghosts, can be killed by burning bones), their once corrupted souls are complete and good again, and allowed passageway to Heaven.

So after S08E17 Meg goes to Heaven, after S12E23 Crowley is also in Heaven.

They'll meet in Heaven again (when?), Dean/Cas/Jack in Heaven so many times, they might run into them. And if it's during the time when Heaven has some trouble, they'd fight alongside again. Or when Heaven crumbles in later seasons, losing power, they are dropped down to Earth just like a normal human soul (previously in their Heaven small separated room formed by their happy memories, on loop, not realizing it's just a looping scene; or Crowley/Meg would notice, because it's basically exactly like Hell memory loop, also just repeating some guilty memory; maybe them being demons for too long and forget their old human life, not having much happy memory, but after being good they actually can feel guilt, they're experiencing their guilty memory too, so Heaven is practically no difference to Hell to them) (need to design Meg's previous life when she was human before she died, not shown in canon)

They drop to Earth as soul/ghost, not bound by demon spell, can enter bunker, so they show up in bunker. Maybe Meg haunts Cas a bit (a lot), Crowley haunts Dean (so maybe could be like destiel background with megstiel and drowley as minor pairing hints). They work together again, try to solve Heaven/Hell/ghost problem again. Maybe make Crowley/Meg human again. Both haven't been human since at least three hundred years, can't get used to it, no special power, a bit down (but Crowley might like it, like the time when he's addicted to human blood, "You don't know how it feels to be human", now he can feel everything). TFW agree to help them adjust.

### 337.【destiel】S03E11 every time Dean dies on Groundhog day Tuesday, he goes to Heaven and sees Cas for one day

(Canon Divergent, see detailed outline in [Post](https://junesirius.github.io/2025/08/26/SPN-03-20-canon-divergent) or [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/junesirius/792977979806515200) 2025-08-26)

Short version of outline:

Every Groundhog day Tuesday after Dean dies, he goes to a pocket dimension of Heaven and spends a full day with Cas. Dean believes it's Hell and Cas is demon. It takes a long time to trust especially when Dean can't remember, but his subconscious is learning. Eventually Dean trusts Cas and they're friends.

Cas investigates why Dean isn't in Hell and if Sam is okay, finds out Trickster is Gabe and it's his manipulated reality, and Gabe puts Dean there. If they break the reality and Dean dies, he'd go to Hell for real. So Cas hides the truth from Dean, they get into fight. Then Sam breaks the loop by threatening Gabe. On Wednesday, Dean dies again and goes to Hell. Sam hunts down Gabe for six months.

Which is sixty years in Hell. Cas doesn't have to but chooses to go to Hell to save and patch Dean, and wipes the memory of him from Dean during rebuild. And then S3 finale Dean goes to Hell again, Cas goes to Hell to save him and rebuild him again. And Dean doesn't remember or trust Cas initially, but shortly his subconscious picks up and trusts Cas completely again.

They spend twelve years like canon does, and many times Cas recognizes activities they once did in Heaven are happening for real on Earth, mundane things like watching TV together. And they're content just as is.

### 338.【Cas/destiel】Angel radio become real radio

Angel radio used to be only exchange of words, only for communication. But it's just wavelength, it can be used for broadcasting anything.

When Cas stays in the bunker watching TV or listening to Dean's music (on his gifted mixtape?), the music and sound become ear loop in his mind, and he doesn't realize he's broadcasting the music to the whole angel radio until some close angel friend using some private channel to tell him he forgets to mute. Or maybe the angels are surprised by it too much they all fall into silence and just listen to those, and for the first time, they realize human music is actually beautiful, even to them. That's how he made all the angels in Heaven know about and fall in love with Led Zeppelin.

### 338.5【destiel】angel!Dean broadcast music to the angel radio

Similar to above, but it's a double angel AU, where Dean is the angel that had the thought and actually deliberately broadcast his favorite music to the whole angel radio. Many other angels don't like that initially, complain a lot, dislike him a lot, consider him too unhinged, unorthodox, too human. But angel Castiel enjoys it, privately goes to Dean to tell him how much he appreciate and enjoy what he shared, those are beautiful music. So now Dean makes their own private angel radio channel become angel music channel. Every time Dean is thinking about the lyrics from his favorite music, Cas can receive and hear, just enjoy it with him.

### 339.【destiel】S01E12 fix-it: Cas is the reaper, Dean prays to save Layla

Layla kissed Dean and left, Dean promised to pray to save her.

Cas is actually the reaper in that episode, captured by bad guy, Dean freed him. Cas could leave but he comes back hearing Dean's prayer.

Cas is still born angel, interned as reaper for promotion from cherub to seraph. Two branches from here: Cas can rebel as reaper and quit the job and goes back to be angel with healing power (but without promotion) and heals Layla. Just like canon rebellion to Heaven to choose Dean. Dean has to help him dealing with his problem now.

Cas can also stay as a reaper, they haven't known each other enough for Cas to give up everything for Dean yet. But Cas remembers the request and Dean's sadness and disappointment. After Cas finishes the reaper period and goes back and becomes seraph, he travels back in time to appear right when the reaper!him leaves, so from Dean's POV Cas comes back for him immediately (but from Cas's POV it's been ages), and Cas heals and saves Layla. They might have consequence again with Cas messing with timeline.

### 339.5【destiel】S01E12 fix-it: Dean prays to save Layla, angel!Cas answers

Similar to above but Cas is an angel at the time of S01E12, when Dean prays, he hears and answers.

Cas that time might be similar to 2003!Cas in S14E13, Heaven's good soldier, initially refuses to help. But similar to Cas in S04E07, he has doubts and questions. Dean challenges him. They might experience something together, someone might sacrifice themselves for others, the typical. In the end, Cas trusts Dean, Dean has faith in him, Cas makes his own decision and saves Layla. (may or may not trigger more consequence from there, Heaven doesn't like what Cas did, they might have to be in war with Heaven again)

### **340.【destiel】S15E03 what if Cas follows the plan, closes rupture and gets buried under**

(heavy angst)

Dean's the one volunteers (forces) Cas to go to Hell with Belphegor the demon to close the rupture, knowing full well he can get under if he doesn't come back quick enough and just to keep up with his act of anger. Cas's heartbroken. In this what-if, Belphegor doesn't lie, they do close the rupture, Cas may or may not have the chance to get out, like if he tries really really hard, he probably has a chance to get out. But thinking about how much Dean seems stop caring about him, he becomes a bit suicidal (exactly like Vince Vincente and his girlfriend parallel), so he doesn't try really hard, so he gets buried under, possibly can't leave Hell forever.

Belphegor: "It's almost like you *want* to get buried under."

Cas: "No one up there cares about me anyway."

The ghost situation up there is solved. Dean waits for Cas to come back, waiting for really really long time. The rift closes. Cas doesn't come back. Dean's eye-rims red, knowing full well this is his fault, this time is fully his pride and temper pushing Cas under the wheel, remembering Cas's look at him when he volunteered him, knowing how much he hurt Cas and how much himself deserve the torture and guilt knowing what he did. Sam doesn't dare to speak to him when he's like that. Practically murderous. But in the core, suicidal.

Dean has to open the rift or whatever disastrous way with whatever ugly consequence to go down there to save Cas. Cas may or may not die down there. Dean has to fix it and apologizes. He'll cry and devastated when he thinks he lost Cas for good and it's all his fault. And he thinks he deserves the pain.

It would be like S15E09, Dean thinking he lost Cas for real and them not being in good terms. He'll apologize and want to confess but too shameful to do so. All the emotional torture.

### 341.【destiel】case fic, Season 6 Episode 66

(inspired by Richard/Rob's podcast for S01E11 when they just joked about not having a S06E66)

can be a case fic, written in the format of a TV show, could look like a script, can be meta narrative

they really have a S06E66 and they have back luck in real life and in shooting life, can be somewhat like S06E15 *French Mistake* AU too

### 342.【all】need bigger cost to save/destroy the world

其实没那么容易杀死xx，要满足一个什么条件才能让xx坠落（天使，路西法，etc），他们中的有人要付出更大代价才能解决他们解决了的某个世界末日灾难

(inspired by OUAT, every time a villain or hero need to make some big change, they have some super big cost, most likely losing the love of their life or the thing that's most important to them)

SPN only uses that once: Rowena has to sacrifice the boy she cared the most for the curse to remove Dean's MoC. what if this is more common in all the other world-ending/saving events.

e.g.: it's actually not so easy to kill blank (someone villain, God, Lucifer, Darkness, Empty, angel, demon, etc.), or like they have to meet more conditions to achieve something (that is already difficult in the show but would be even more difficult in this case), things like S08E23's angel/demon trial, Cas gets told he'll have to sacrifice more to seal Heaven like he'll have to sacrifice Dean, would he continue do that, similar to Dean realize he'll have to sacrifice Sam to seal Hell; or Metatron has to sacrifice more to make all the angels fall, would he continue do that -- he's probably the kind that doesn't want to risk anything to achieve something, so maybe he'd stop.

And for something they achieved in canon, some of them would cost them much more than in canon to solve what they otherwise would have solved (one of the apocalypses etc.), would they continue do those

(a general vague idea, can be expanded/detailed if having clearer ideas later)

### 343.【destiel】S15E09/S15E18 Sam losing hope sets God free, Dean losing hope breaks Empty free

（Sam失去希望能让God自由，Dean失去希望能让Empty自由，最大反派Empty）

inspired by/parallel to S15E09, the key to set God free is that Sam loses hope, in a parallel of God <-> Empty and Sam <-> Dean, and something about Eileen be there in the same room with Sam and getting forced to hurt Sam before Sam losing hope, and transfer the idea to Dean. After S15E18 losing Cas, Dean loses hope, maybe Dean has some connection with Empty in the way he/they didn't know before, maybe something to do with his profound bond with Cas, the core is Dean losing hope and that's the key to set/break Empty "free".

"Free" can be like Empty is now free to come to Earth to grab more human as it wishes, becoming the ultimate worst villain of the theory, worse than God. So after S15E19, the series isn't over yet. With God defeated and Death killed, they don't have many heavy players on the board, they'll have to figure something out to fight against Empty. And Dean's motivation would be mainly to save Cas, less about defeating the villain and saving the world.

Or, "break free" can also be like easier to break jail and bust the prisoners out, that's how Dean gets to enter Empty and save Cas. (this one a little similar to prompt 204 done work《Glimpse》)

### 344.【destiel】S05E14/S14E08 Dean's empty heart is the entryway for Empty to come to Earth, they need to fill it to stop Empty to save Cas

（丁被Famine指出他的心是空的，是empty，这是Empty入侵的trigger，只有当丁不empty的时候才能彻底阻止Empty来地球，就算有deal也没用，s14-15之间他们发现了这个，所以丁为了救卡的deal要在一年里让自己填满（限时略微强制恋爱？已经有吸引力））

S05E14 Famine said Dean's heart is empty (that's why he's not affected by Famine, because he doesn't want/desire anything). That's the trigger for Empty to enter Earth.

Famine: "That's one deep, dark nothing you got there. Can't fill it. Not with food or drink. Not even with sex."

Famine: "I can see inside you, Dean. I can see how broken you are, how defeated. You can't win, and you know it. But you just keep fighting. Just... keep going through the motions. You're not hungry, Dean, because inside, you're already...dead."

Empty needs someone that's truly empty and dead inside to be like its entrance door to the Earth. And Dean's the only one with the strongest and longest emptiness inside, lasted for at least ten years, maybe forty years already by S15. Only when Dean is *not empty* can they shut the door to stop Empty coming to Earth, or using someone else (who's not as powerful as Dean) so Empty would be weak and easy to fight off even if it comes. Without that "entry person", even a deal wouldn't be able to allow Empty to the Earth.

So some time between S14E08 and S15E18, they find out this fact and Cas's deal with Empty. The only solution to stop Empty from coming and saving Cas is to fill Dean's heart, make him not empty; meanwhile delay Cas's happiness, make him continue miserable and unhappy. Which are essentially two exactly opposite, controversial thing they have to do.

(likely heavy angsty, heaving mutual pining)

What would Dean to make himself full to save Cas? They already both know the tension and pull and attraction between them, both must have already at least somewhat know one another's love. What would they do?

And Dean has to hurry. It might be a little like time-limited forced love, having a countdown somewhere (have to fall in love and be happy in one year or he dies sort of situation). But not really "forced" since they're already in love. They just have to figure out what's the best way to approach.

### 345.【Cas/destiel】Cas's old wiped angel memory comes back, lead to broken multi-personality syndrome or similar

（每个人被抹掉的记忆都没彻底抹掉，只是放在墙后面，卡因为一些什么触发想起以前遗忘的事）

Similar to Sam's Hell memory isn't wiped but just put behind the wall, no one's memory can be completely wiped, they're always just put behind some wall, same for angels, same for how Naomi brainwashes angels. So all of Cas's past brainwashed memories are behind his brain wall, and one day something happened, the wall crumbled, Cas gets triggered and remembered those (or partially) things he forgot. Mostly biblical past, like the one Naomi mentioned is the time in Egypt when they kill the first-born, and Cas obviously didn't follow the order again (which is why he's wiped).

The brain wall falling apart might also make him super painful, maybe crazy, maybe like multi personality syndrome, maybe disassociation, something psychologically bad and mentally unstable.

Or it may happen when Cas is human (S09 or post-S15), brain doesn't have as much capacity as when he's angel, he thought he's forgetting more things, but on the contrary after this trigger, he's remembering too much more, his head/brain can't handle. Something bad/painful complications might happen.

(≈ prompt 78)

### 346.【destiel】every time Cas revives, he doesn't have memory; he spends time to recollect them then flies back in time

(inspired by above prompt 345)

（卡每次复活记忆都是被抹掉的，在找到丁之前都是花了一段时间重新记起，然后穿越时间回到丁以为他死了的时间来继续他们关系，丁一开始不知道，后来怎么发现了）

Every time Cas is resurrected, his memory is wiped, he's always recreated and patched to be like a newly factory reset angel (by Chuck or others), he has to spend time to recollect his memory, re-remember everything they've been through, re-remember Dean, go to places they've spent time together before. Until he's sure he remembered everything (which might take a really long time), he flies back in time to the time Dean thinks he's gone and he's back. So they can just keep on with where their relationship was and continue developing.

At first Dean doesn't know this, the wipe-recollect-relearn-fly back that Cas always have to do on his own. Then one day somehow he finds out. Maybe because Cas slips a sentence somewhere about having spent more time on Earth before/between certain events than Dean thought, or because he forgets something and Dean notices.

### 347.【Chuck】Chuck gets beaten up in Empty by dead angels/demons

（Chuck在Empty被别的angel demon 暴揍）

at some point for some reason Chuck dies as God and goes to Empty, and the dead angels/demons are woken up and realizes how big of an asshole he is. And in the Empty, the dead God (and everyone) doesn't have their powers. So everyone just beats him up very physically, all the dead angels/demons that aren't happy about him (and maybe not usually synced to be in the same team) are very enthusiastic to do this one thing together.

### 348.【Cas/destiel】S15E18 Cas wakes up other angels/demons in Empty and leads them to fight their way back

（卡在Empty唤醒所有在Empty的同伴杀出血路撕破Empty回来，有Gabe, Bal, Meg, Anna, Sammandriel, Crowley, etc.）

After S15E18 Cas goes to Empty, he wakes up all the other angels/demons that are sleeping in Empty at that time, leads them to fight their way back bloodily. Everyone they lost and were his friend are helping. (Or doesn't have to, even the ones that were enemies might also help. Or he didn't wake them.)

### 349.【Cas/destiel】where does angel go when they die in Empty?

(inspired by above prompt 348)

（卡在Empty快要被杀死）

similar to S08 when they asked: "Where does monster go when they die in Purgatory?" Cas now faces new question of "Where does angel/demon go when they die in Empty?"

maybe similar to the battle he triggered as in prompt 348, they're fighting their way out of Empty, some of them die in Empty. Cas might be one of them. Where does he go? He might be worried he'd really die this time and never see Dean again?

### 350.【destiel】their profound bond is broken

（因为出了一件什么事，丁卡的Profound bond断了）

Something happened, their profound bond is broken, and they both can feel it, very physically strongly, like maybe it's like a light background white noise their brain/ear is used to, and once it's broken, it becomes purely quiet, they only then realize its existence all this time. The realization pains them.

kinda like a divorce, like DW S07E01 Amy/Rory's divorce

something else happened, they might have to save one another again, trying very hard to rebuild their profound bond again. Dean might even consider deal himself to Hell again so Cas can save him again. It's very difficult but eventually they rebuild it and get back together again. Shout out their love confession and have it fixed.

(related to and maybe can also include prompt 351)

### 351.【destiel】find each other because of profound bond

(inspired by OUAT Snow White & Prince Charming)

（因为Profound bond，所以他们总是能找到彼此（OUAT白白夫夫 “I'll always find you” “I'll never lose you”应和对称），到对方在的地方）

Dean/Cas can always find each other wherever they are because of their profound bond.

can quote OUAT chick-flick contrast: "I'll always find you." "I'll never lose you." One about how they just keep losing each other but determined to find, taking active actions, the other about how they will never lose the other, tackling abandonment issue.

important for Dean/Cas to address the sense of security/insecurity/abandonment issue

(similar to and maybe can be used in prompt 350)

### 352.【destiel】S06E22 what if Sam's blade worked and killed Cas

what if Cas isn't God yet, just still an angel with too much power, maybe transforming to God still takes a while and he's not done yet, just halfway during the process and he can still be stabbed to death by angel blade. And the moment Sam stabbed him from the back, he does break apart and begin dying. He apologizes to Dean and says all the sorry and dies in his arms. What will happen next, what will happen between Sam and Dean, knowing Sam is the one killed Cas, how could Sam ever face Dean again and how would Dean treat him.

### 353.【destiel】Dean learns about unconditional love for the first time

(inspired by myself and some old tumblr posts seen before)

mainly saying Dean doesn't know about unconditional love until he meets Cas, all the time he believes he has to be useful to be loved, so when he and Cas are not in good terms, he's almost always surprised when Cas is still willing to heal him (though Cas is so pissed he doesn't touch Dean when heal him, be like "I'm still deeply in love with you but I'm pissed at you").

Some small case fic or daily story about Dean learning for the first time about unconditional love, realize that fight and conflict doesn't necessarily end things, relationships with conflict can still work (as compared to all the other times in his past experience, every time there is some conflict in the relationships, he just dump and run, escape to end it and start looking for a new one, also inspired by my own experience), how do they handle the conflict and let Dean believe even if they fight, they'd still love each other enough to keep this thing between them going, the conflict doesn't have to the deal-breaker.

(remember some old posts somewhere, couples in quarrel, one is so pissed and leave the house to cool their head down, but still doesn't forget to send message to the other, letting them know they're not leaving, they just need the time and space, they'll come back. That sense of security is so rare and heartbreakingly warm.)

### ~~354.【destiel】Cas's surprise birthday party【done】~~

On September 18th, Jody calls Dean to ask if he and Cas have time to come over to help, Dean initially planed to prepare Cas a birthday setting in the bunker, thinks Jody has a case so they have to work, so Dean has to give up his plan unhappily, goes to Jody's with Cas. Only to find it's actually Claire tries to give Cas a surprise birthday party but too shy to tell Cas directly, so she made Jody make the call. So in the end all of them give Cas a birthday at Jody's.

(where is Sam and Jack? working on something else somewhere else? Sam teasing Dean to be pining/sassy to be pining but still doesn't dare to confess and be together with Cas?)

(something wrong with the cake or something small? easy to fix, but supernaturally wrong, like something in local grocery shop goes wrong when they go to buy something last minute (Jody sends them out just so keep them out of kitchen for a minute), so it's still a case and a job, but one that's relatively easy to fix. Dean/Cas have a moment in the shop to fix it, BAMF Cas moment, Dean appreciates, lovable moment)

(double dream setting? Dean wakes up from the dream in Jody's house, remembering the reality is Cas is gone to Empty; Dean startles awake from that dream again, realizing the reality is Cas is back from Empty, they're together and retired, and it's Cas's birthday again, he's just too worried he'd mess Cas's birthday and having nightmare again first time in ages, Cas comforts him, they'd go get cake and call Jody/Claire just in a bit after Sun's up, right now it's cuddling time)

### 355.【destiel】Cas gifts his birthday to be Dean's

They don't celebrate Cas's birthday on September 18th because that's the date Dean climbs out of grave from Hell, that's not a pleasant memory for Dean, Cas doesn't want to remind him, but Dean remembers anyway. Cas suggests September 18th should be considered "Dean's birthday" instead of his, because he's re-birthed.

"My birthday is the day I met you. The day I met you is the day I was born, I started having a real, human life."

### 356.【all】monster in water stain

(inspired/adapted from 2025-09-06 dream) (a little DW style)

case fic

A new type of monster in a house, looks exactly look like a puddle of water stain on the floor, but it can move; the puddle/stain move from floor to wall, to ceiling, in and out, big and small, very obvious it's alive. But no one knows what it is, how to kill it (how to kill some water?), if it's killing/hurting people, what will happen if you touch it, if it can leave the room. people have to discuss it, argue a bit, can't decide.

### 357.【all】curse of "Macbeth"

(first heard of from Rich/Rob's SPN Then and Now S03E01)

reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scottish_Play

case fic

The curse of Macbeth on stage: uttering "Macbeth" in a theater can bring bad luck to a production. To avoid it, refer to the play as "The Scottish Play". The ritual to counteract it: leaving the theater, spinning three times, spitting, and knocking to be invited back in. Bad luck accidents to the production could include: accidental fall from ladder, prop changing from fake to real dagger to hurt, stage building breaking down, etc.. Might be related to the real curse in the show's witch's ritual.

The Winchesters/TFW goes to investigate a stage that's affected by the curse. Could insert a scene where Dean/Cas have to perform the Macbeth or other Shakespeare show on stage during hunting.

### 358.【destiel】"No one enters a relationship without childhood trauma"

(inspired by a casual read and myself)

read it somewhere: "No one enters a relationship without childhood trauma"

Dean reads it from somewhere coincidentally? and finally have courage to try out relationship with Cas?

side plot case fic with relationship therapist and starts out random fake relationship then turns real, and the advice hits right on the spot and gives him huge realization and starts to be brave

something triggering and remind Dean of his need of being needed/wanted and abandonment issue, someone around mindlessly having a casual conversation and mentioned that and Dean is suddenly enlightened

the example in the reading: accidentally spill something or make a small mistake, get reminded of the childhood trauma of being scolded/hit/punished for making a very similar mistake, waiting for being punished again by the partner, but the other only fixes the issue gently and comforts them not to worry, overwriting the traumatic memory, helping him to overcome the trauma. The right relationship is to meant to help heal.

(The contradictory thing read in the past: "You don't go into a relationship before learning to be your complete self." Fix your issues and traumas and be whole before being in a relationship. might be the exact reason that discourages Dean to start something with Cas, even if they have feelings and everything in place, Dean doesn't think he's ready and will mess it up. slow burn?)

### 359.【destiel】Cas is in love but rejects Dean when Dean proposes to be in relationship

(inspired by 358)

counter expectation: a story where they are very clear in love and both recognize it, they confessed, Cas might be the first to confess, Dean might be the one courageous enough to move forward first this time, proposing they start some relationship, but it's Cas that's not ready, thinking he'll mess things up, he's not human, he has issues, he wronged Dean so many times, he doesn't think he can manage it without losing Dean, he'll lose Dean in the end anyway one way or another because Dean is mortal and will die eventually, he already knows he'd be so happy if they're together and he knows he'd love Dean really really much, and so the death of Dean will be too much to bear, Cas doesn't think he'd be able to handle that pain so he thinks if they're not together, it might be not as painful to handle.

Dean has to find him (Cas might run/fly away after his stuttering rejection that surprised Dean), there might be miscommunication too, Dean gets super surprised that Cas would say no, he believed they're already clear they're in love, they already admitted to each other they're in love, he can't understand what he did wrong that Cas doesn't want him. Dean might sulk a bit, might even be angry a little bit. Maybe enlightened by Sam or someone to go look for Cas to ask and talk (with real words) to understand why.

Cas would be really upset and torn because he rejected (even worse than Dean who's the one getting rejected), he really really wants that but doesn't dare to start. They try something small, Dean trying to let Cas see having something than losing with pain would be better than not having anything at all and regret for eternity. Dean encourages Cas to get up the courage to handle the foreseeable pain. or maybe they run into some event to realize that, a side plot case fic maybe, almost losing each other again? they agree to have a try and see where it goes. so they're together in the end.

### 360.【destiel】小王子AU

Inspired by AO3 "[Ad Astra](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1013491)" and *The Little Prince*

Cas is the Little Prince, the falling star, falling to the Earth, learning about humans

Dean is the lost dying pilot in the desert

sad fairytale style story

### 361.【destiel】human!Cas x non-human!Dean

inspired by BucketofLi's art

details in ["2025 Destiel AU Reverse Bang" whole novel script](https://github.com/junesirius/junesirius.github.io/blob/master/_posts/Supernatural/SPN_AU_RB/SPN-AURB-whole-novel.md)

### 361.1【destiel】The Shape of Water AU

biology researcher Cas finds magic creature Dean, slow burn, getting familiar, mutual attraction, mutual protecting, temporary death, eventual happy ending

### 361.2【destiel】student!Cas x creature!Dean

Dean is not mistreated, but still lonely and unhappy. Cas takes care of him, understands him. (college life)

### 361.3【destiel】human student!Cas x non-human student!Dean

Dean hides non-human identity, being exposed, mutual attraction, equality talk, self-identity issue (college life)

### 361.4【destiel】angel!Cas x djinn!Dean, magic school AU

(from Constantine prompt 9)

self discovery, canon compliant (magic school life)

### **362.【destiel】S04E01 Cas is actually a demon, Dean is right about not believing angel exists**

(≈ prompt 335, but without the changing; heavy angst)

Dean is actually right to not believe or trust Cas is an angel and that angel doesn't exist. Cas is actually a demon, maybe he lied, maybe he's lied to, genuinely believed he's an angel not a demon, or actually "Heaven" is a division of Hell and the so-called "angel" is a subspecies of demon, but they'll only find out later. If Cas lied about being a true demon, maybe because he knows how Dean sees demons, he doesn't want Dean see him that way to start with, doesn't want Dean disgust him or hate him.

(Patch: why demon blade and salt rock gun doesn't harm him when Dean shoots/stabs him (which is essential to believing Cas is an angel) is because they only work on lower rank demons, like in S12E12 demon blade also doesn't harm Ramiel, Prince of Hell, Cas might also be a Prince or Knight like Abaddon, so very strong powerful, different eye color, black-blue or dark blue without pupil, no grace; or might be his own rank/sub-race within demon, like Lilith being the only white-eyed, Crowley being the only red-eyed, Cas can be the only blue-eyed demon, prompt 285 Dean is green-eyed demon)

But Cas is indeed the one saving Dean from Hell, except not because angels siege the Pit, he's already there, he's responsible for that Hell Division, he's possibly even superior of Asmodeus (yellow-eye, same rank as Ramiel, also Prince of Hell, also immune to Ruby's blade) or his colleague. He has easy access to Dean, be there with/for him, talk/acquittance/slow build their relationship. Maybe Cas didn't know about God's plan or Azazel's plan initially, but somehow he finds it out, may or may not be too late that Dean already broke the first seal and begins torturing. Cas already starts caring about Dean too much, doesn't think Dean deserve to be there, or maybe something triggers him to make the decision to rebel against Hell (sorta like Ruby as a Hell-cast-out demon, hunted/hated by other demons, thinking she'd the demon traitor), but the funny thing about being demon: being bad is good, betraying is good, he's doing exactly what demon is expected to do (but with free will), and so does Dean. ("I'm a demon, what do you expect?")

Cas rebels, "falls" upward, saving Dean from Hell, but doesn't want him to know. Dean maybe remembers clips from Hell, remembering pieces when he spent time with demon!Cas (when they're both down there, they might could already have intimate/explicit moments, or maybe Dean wanted, Cas doesn't, so they're almost there but not quite). Maybe Cas knows some memory magic that he wipes himself away from Dean's memory of Hell, so he could stay with Dean the whole time in S4 without worrying him remembering his true identity. ("Why do you wipe his only good memory down there?" "I don't want him see me like that, we can create new memory up there." Cas has other "good" demon friend down there? Balthazar is also a angel-division demon? so does all the other canon angels? some interaction/involvement with Crowley somewhere around here)

Then something happens, or someone tells Dean the truth, that Cas is lying to him, Dean confronts Cas, maybe it's also Cas's first time realizing, maybe he's ashamed, Dean feels betrayed, heavy angst, big conflict moment. Dean might have way/weapon to kill Cas at this moment, they might find out Michael's Lance (S12E12, but not in Ramiel's place yet, Crowley gives him that, so it's still in Crowley's place, Crowley might give it to Dean, Dean might know it beforehand and somehow steal/take it from Crowley), so now Dean could kill Cas with Michael's Lance. Cas might think he deserves it anyway, he didn't save Dean from becoming demon in the first place, he had thirty years' chance, but Dean ended up still becoming demon and breaking the first seal. So Cas doesn't resist when Dean's almost kill him, maybe Dean actually kills him and regrets immediately and in heavy angst pain and has to save Cas back from Empty. Or maybe Dean can't even if he wants, or he's stopped by someone else, maybe it's Sam stopping him, saying Cas is only trying to do good and help him, it doesn't matter he's a demon (Sam is always good at relating to non-humans/"monsters", compassion with them, knowing they didn't choose their species), and apparently Cas cares about Dean and works hard to help them stop the Apocalypse, doesn't want Lucifer out (like Crowley). So Dean ends up not killing Cas and realizes Cas does care about him a lot and himself to Cas too.

Maybe Cas believes even if Dean doesn't kill him, he's being resented, not needed/wanted, so he leaves and resents himself, and maybe does something reckless, putting himself in danger, maybe even dying or dead. Dean comes to look for him, show genuinely care and love to him, let him know he's accepted as he is, brings him home.

(not sure how to end, maybe open ending, Dean accepts Cas's demon identity, they continue to be together, saving world as human & demon. maybe a line that Dean tells Cas he's even better a demon than anything else, he doesn't care if he's a real angel or not, because to him, he already is. Cas is relieved and finally accepts himself as well.)

### 363.【destiel】S04E01 demon!Dean x demon!Cas

(inspired by 362, ≈ S10 demon!Dean x Crowley)

Cas is actually a demon. When Dean's in Hell and becoming sorta demon, Cas is the demon that teaches him how to survive as a demon. demon!Dean is more cruel and ruthless in torturing and enjoying it, terrifies the authentic demon!Cas. Something something, the two of them fight against Asmodeus and Lilith and escape Hell together. Rewrite S04 to stop Apocalypse together as both demons.

(not sure how to end, maybe open ending, they continue to be what they are, accept their identities, continue helping people, saving world, as demons. Even as demons, they do what they think are the right things to do, who to say they're not humans or even better, like angels in fairy tales with fluffy wings and halos.)

(Inspired by one destiel fic where Dean's demon and they save S04 Apocalypse, Michael can't possess demon!Dean as vessel, it gives them benefit)

### 364.【destiel】angel!Dean x demon!Cas

(inspired by 363, ≈ Good Omens reversed)

Cas is a demon, but just a small role, maybe not even a really good one, working in sales under Crowley, just punching the clock and making deals. (maybe also canon divergent, Empty kicks him out but turns him into a demon and wipes his memory. No Jack in this version? they didn't win and Chuck still the God? it's one of Chuck's version of destiel?)

Dean is an angel, thinking he doesn't have a big role (but he does, his memory is altered, actually canon compliant/divergent, it's after S15E20, he's in Heaven and there is volunteer/forced? program to change souls to make angels to save missing angel issue that could potentially crumble Heaven, and Dean becomes one, Naomi in charge?).

They both have mission on Earth and run into each other. Maybe Dean is even tasked to monitor demon activity on Earth and is supposed to kill Cas, but he observes Cas and decides against it, falls for Cas. something big might happen in the background, Apocalypse might happen again and they work together to stop it. maybe find out their previous memory again? maybe crossover with the canon Dean & Cas. maybe this is one of the many worlds Chuck is destroying in S15 to get to canon Dean/Cas, they figure out world-crossing spell and cross to canon world (like hunter corp!Dean&Sam), help canon TFW fight against Chuck

### 365.【destiel】《Die Hard the Hunter》（Lyrics）

(by Def Leppard)

Shotgun

Let's welcome home the soldier boy

(Far away, far away)

No angel of mercy just a need to destroy

(Fire away, fire away)

Let's toast the hero with blood in his eyes

The scars on his mind took so many lives

Die hard the hunter



Welcome home, soldier boy

Put down your pistol, yeah, put down your toy

Yeah, they can take a gun away from you

But never take away your attitude

They can't do that



You got no enemy, no front line

The only battle's in the back of your mind

You don't know how to change from bad to good

You brought the war to your neighborhood

You can't do that

No no, no you can't do that



You're caught in a trap

(Hunter) there's no lookin' back

(Die hard) he's lost in the crowd

(Hunter) die hard and proud

Die hard the hunter



Back in the city, he's a man on the loose

He is the shadow that's following you

He takes no prisoners when he's hunting for game

He's got a bullet, and it carries your name

You can't do that, you can't do that

You can't do that, oh, no, no, no



Die hard the hunter (Watch out)

Die hard, he's got blood in his eyes

Die hard the hunter, he's hungry for days

Die hard the hunter, his bullet carries your name

You can't do that

No, no, no



(Hunters are soldiers, hunter's PTSD is like soldier's PTSD after they come home, they come back from the battlefield but can never really come home. later season Dean, maybe post-S15 Dean, want to retire but PTSD)

### 366.【destiel】《We Pray》（Lyrics）

(by Coldplay)

Whoa oh, and so we pray

I pray that I don't give up, pray that I do my best

Pray that I can lift up, pray my brother is blessed

Prayin' for enough, pray Virgilio wins

Pray I judge nobody and forgive me my sins



I pray we make it, pray my friend will pull through

Pray as I take it unto other, I do

Prayin' on your love, we pray with every breath

Though I'm in the valley of the shadow of death



And so we pray for someone to come and show me the way

And so we pray for some shelter and some records to play

And so we pray, we'll be singin' "Baraye"

Pray that we make it to the end of the day



And so we pray, I know somewhere that Heaven is waitin'

And so we pray, I know somewhere there's something amazin'

And so we pray, I know somewhere we'll feel no pain

Until we make it to the end of the day



I pray that love will shelter us from our fears

Oh, I pray you trust to let me wipe off your tears

Confront all the pain that we felt inside

With all the cars we've been dealt in life

Pray I speak my truth and keep my sisters alive



So for the ones who parted seas

For the ones who's followin' dreams

For the ones who knocked down doors

And allowed us to pass down keys

Pray that we speak with a tongue that is honest

And that we understand how to be modest

Pray when she looks at herself in the mirror

She sees a queen, she sees a goddess



On my knees, I pray, as I sleep and wake

'Cause inside my head is a frightenin' place

Keep a smiling face, only by His grace

'Cause love's more than I can take, hey



And so we pray (and so we pray)

And so we pray (and so we pray)

'Till nobody's in need and everybody can say

### 368.【destiel?/Bobby?】S06E12 "Just 'cause it kills your liver don't mean it ain't medicine"

mourning something/someone? widower arc?

something about Dean's drinking problem?

### 369.【Claire】pre-S10E09 trained hitman Claire

Claire-centered, canon divergent from before making up with Cas (S10E20) or running into Randy (S10E09/10)

Claire misses her dad Jimmy, goes to look for him (or during looking for mom, S10E20), she runs into a hitman group and her skill is impressive enough to be accepted and trained professionally

the next time she runs into Dean/Cas, she's very skillful in fighting, she surprises them (makes Cas very upset) or even wins them in fighting, or fights them, or almost kills them, or actually kills Dean (during S10 MoC time, making Dean demon, be there when they handle demon!Dean)

maybe a lot on Claire-Cas/Dean relationship, dadstiel

(inspired by *Leon*, *John Wick*, *Punisher S02*, *Kingsman*; any action movie having a very skillful killer/hitman teaching/carrying around a tough little girl)

### 370.【destiel】AU World where Wings is a shame

(inspired by DW S15E06)

AU world where angel is not a welcomed species, as bad as demon? or demon runs the world? angels can't make their wings invisible, some angels choose to cut their wings off, Cas hides his wings (or deformed it by twisting it too much to hide it inside clothe or something similar) to pretend he's human

Cas has to hide his identity, living very carefully

(heavy angst, self discovery)

Dean is there helping him self discovery

### 371.【destiel】Dean and Cas's self-hatred materialized

(inspired by myself)

case fic setting

maybe witch or cursed object or come from some ancient god or something from bunker etc., a mirror or mirror room that can materialize one's self image

Dean and Cas go in there to investigate, run into another pair of Dean and Cas, both the image of themselves, the materialization of their self-hatred. the more they hate themselves, the stronger those two materialized figures are. they'll have to stop self-hatred or they'll die

(≈ Doctor Who feeling, *Solaris*, SPN canon guilt-centered episodes? like S3 dream world)

### 372.【destiel】confession room

(inspired by myself, *Daredevil*)

Dean's guilt is too heavy, Sam suggests him to go to confession room to make himself feel better (or maybe a case, they have canon case where Dean went into confession room too)

Cas is on the other side of the confession room, specifically there to release Dean's guilt, be a part to make him feel better about himself

"no one has the right to judge him, not even himself"

canon-divergent/compliant? don't want to make it Father!Cas AU, maybe still canon!Cas or pre-series angel!Cas, nothing explicit like many Father!Cas fic does, make it specifically about feelings and emotions and guilt, and how Cas helps him release guilt and hate himself less

### 373.【Dean/destiel】S04E03 Dean Van Halen + S04E05 Monster Movie → Dracula AU

S04E03 Dean told young John his name is Dean Van Halen

can just make it a Dracula AU

### 374.【Roch】RPF: Rob/Rich, friend/lover

inspired by their podcast "SPN Then and Now", around S6 now

In the podcast they joked about chat room people commented on the pairing of them to be Roch (Rob+Rich) directly combine together, though doesn't sound very good.

want to write something around Rob and Rich, listened to them for 100 hours or so, feel like can already hear their voices in my head, know them and their moves and decisions reasonably well, ready to write something for them

unsure of what story exactly, but must have the two of them together, canon divergent perhaps, their relationship has a lot of tension, rival or enemy or something similar. and then something happened, maybe for a real case fic, they go solve, something else happened, they get together very closely, be it friend or lover (need to remember their each's wives/kids/family) up to decide, just needs to talk and keep things steady. (Don't want to make this character because tension is between the two actors.)

### 375.【destiel】S04E01 Cas patches Dean's body in Hell

the handprint is left after Dean's body is patched/rebuilt, so what if it means Cas has to patch Dean's body before taking him out of Pit

what's it like to fight a war while fixing Dean's body? unlike what we used to imagine Cas fix Dean's body&soul in quiet place, he has to fight while fix. Or manage to find a quiet place in Hell? or fix while Dean's demon side is still resisting, Cas has to control Dean's resist while fixing him. or fix him while demon!Dean has conscious (but he doesn't remember)

### 376.【John/Mary】S04E03 Dean never know Mary is a hunter

Dean never knows Mary is a hunter, does John never know that in original un-disturbed Dean-never-timetravelled timeline? or did John know that but lie to Dean&Sam all the time when they asked about mom growing up? or did Mary lie to John all the time, how did she manage to keep John in dark? does that mean John never met Samuel & Deanna? how did Mary keep John away from every single Campbell family member? all of Campbells are hunters but none of them even heard of Dean & Sam (S06), how did Mary manage that? by keep lying?

Mary named her firstborn after her mom, then secondborn after her dad. so Mary is more close to her mom than dad?

### 377.【Jack】S15E18 fixit: Jack try really hard to save Cas, Dean & Jack relationship-focused

S15E18-fix it (S15E20 doesn't exist) but Jack-focused, Jack is more anxious & guilty than Dean, thinking/knowing Cas is dead because of him (and Dean thinks it's because of him), Jack tries to go to Empty to save Cas but fails (God has no power in Empty), Jack is wounded, Dean needs to help Jack to overcome his guilt (and his own). Two of them have to make effort together.

(inspired by tumblr post: Cas making deal to save and the deal is cashed in because of his love for Dean, is a parallel to Mary making deal to save John and the deal is cashed in because she's there for Sam, and a parallel to John making deal to save Dean)

(inspired by 《[ascend](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27823678)》)

Dean willing to self-sacrifice to save Cas, Jack to Dean: "I already lost one father, don't make me lose another"

### 378.【all】S01E01+S04E03 Mary didn't get out of bed, John takes care of baby Sam

Dean timetravel back to warn Mary don't get out of bed that night, what if she remembered, or just canon-wise John didn't sleep in sofa before TV that night, John's woken by Sam's cry or Mary asked John to go, anyway, John goes to Sam, runs into Azazel, John fights Azazel before Sam is fed demon blood, what will happen next?

### 379.【destiel】old man destiel ideas

during Dean's four-month death, how's the mourning process like for Bobby and Sam

### 381.【Lucy/Jamie】S04E05 Monster movie creature has crash for Jamie, showing up as her best lady friend, but she's straight（F/F）

Jamie agrees to date Dean, is likely straight

shapeshifter appears as Lucy, being her best female friend, stay close to her, working with her everyday, watching her going out with other male customer, heartbroken

Lucy show up as Dracula, calling Jamie her Mina, calling Dean Jonathan Harker

conclusion: Lucy self-identifies as female, fall in love with Jamie, approach her as female, realize she's straight and wouldn't ever be with her, heartbroken, turn to act as Dracula

canon-divergent, story without Winchesters, Lucy self-direct/act as a monster & hero, shapeshift into bad guy to hurt Jamie and hero Lucy to save her, hoping Jamie to fall in love with her

sad ending?

monster self-exile or death? believing Jamie would never love her back? Jamie kill her or Lucy allow herself to be killed by Jamie? the reason why Lucy turn into Dracula is thinking this time she appears to be male, maybe Jamie would love her/him now.

very confused self-identity recognition/understanding, story of a bi/lesbian fall in love with straight girl, sad ending

maybe could also include destiel, Dean witness Lucy/Jamie story, realizing he and Cas are also in love but both confused about self-identity too

### 382.【destiel】S04E06 coward!Dean has to gather courage to save Cas

something happened to Cas right when Dean's affected with that ghost disease cowardness problem, he really has to overcome his fear to get to Cas, and Dean does everything he can for Cas regardless of his fear

### 383.【destiel】S04E06 what if coward!Dean dies

Dean has two hours left before Sam and Bobby figure out how to kill that ghost, and their "scare the ghost dead" way doesn't work, Dean is scared to death hallucinating Lilith and hellhounds, and gets dragged to Hell again (souls went to Hell can't go to Heaven, so every death after S04E01, Dean would always end up in Hell). so Cas has to save him again

Alastair: "Coming back so soon?"

Cas/angels: "Can you be more careful? It takes a lot of angels to get you out, you can't go visit there every other day"

just to pretend Dean accidentally die again, Cas gets assigned to start guarding task to keep an eye on Dean from then on

### 384.【destiel】S04E07 Cas/angel is tasked to kill Sam

S04E07 Uriel threatens Sam that the moment Sam ceases to be useful, he'll turn him to dust.

S05E13 Anna prepares to kill Sam and scatter his cells across the universe.

what if Cas or some other angel is determined to kill Sam to stop Lucifer (angels who don't know Michael's plan of deliberately trying to free Lucifer out of Cage to start Apocalypse)

S4 timeline Cas doesn't know Sam enough and only knows him as the boy with demon blood and Lucifer's true vessel and abomination, what would Cas do?

### 385.【destiel】S04E01 handprint is a piece of Cas in Dean

Cas could never be fully dead (as long as Dean's alive) because literally a real piece of him is in Dean, through the handprint. The profound bond is literally because he is really *in* Dean.

The righteous man's body can't be patched just so easily without extra sacrifice, it requires something with similar power of a soul that matches/is close enough to his to fix him. The only thing close is Cas's grace, so Cas takes out a shred of his grace to fix Dean, like donating blood to save his life. The handprint is a proof/link to inject his grace into Dean.

So when Cas is killed, he's not *fully* gone. As long as that piece of him is still in Dean and Dean's alive, Cas has a passageway to come back.

### 386.【Chuck】post-S15E20 Chuck's normal human life

(inspired by 《[ascend](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27823678)》)

Chuck's normal human life after S15E20, it's like he gets a second chance. They leave him alone, on the premise/assumption that he'll have a miserable life. But what if not necessarily. Maybe he doesn't have to be having a nameless meaningless life, maybe he'll make something out of this human life. Maybe he can even turn good, he'll value the life as a human, starts appreciating the world he created and only viewed from above, this is the first time he lived in it and fully experience it for the first time. Maybe he can be a celebrity or something, discover social media, with his ability of persuasion and plausibility and talks, maybe he can get a lot of people to be brainwashed and follow him. He might get famous and rich even, kinda like S12E06 rock star Lucifer. The feeling of being admired is toxic, and he gets a taste of it and it's addictive.

Or maybe he'll continue to be pathetic and miserable, living an awful human life, can't get used to it, poor, like Metatron's human life.

### 388.【destiel】S15E18-fixit: Cas's happiness is taken by Empty even after he comes back

(inspired by 《[ascend](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27823678)》)

S15E18 fix-it: After Cas comes back from Empty, even if he's saved, his happiness and ability to feel happy has been taken by the Empty, so he can't feel happy again, even if Dean reciprocates. He becomes a bit apathy, more like brainwashed or soulless version. Dean has to figure out a way to fit that.

### 389.【all】《God was never on your side》(Lyrics)

(by Motorhead)

If the stars fall down on me
And the sun refuse to shine
Then may the shackles be undone
May all the old words cease to rhyme

If the sky turn into stone
It will matter not at all
For there is no Heaven in the sky
Hell does not wait for our downfall

Let the voice of reason chime
Let the pious vanish for all time
God's face is hidden, all unseen
You can't ask Him what it all means

Let right or wrong alone decide
God was never on your side

See ten thousand ministries
See the holy, righteous dogs
They claim to heal, but all they do is steal
Abuse your faith, cheat and rob

If God is wise, why is He still
When these false prophets call Him friend?
Why is He silent, is He blind?
Are we abandoned in the end?

Let the sword of reason shine
Let us be free of prayer and shrine
God's face is hidden, turned away
He never has a word to say

### 390.
