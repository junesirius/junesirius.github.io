### Aliens and Space

1. An alien killed your boss and replaced him over a week ago. Everyone knows he’s not the boss due to his terrible disguise, but he’s such a better person than the original that everyone just goes along with it. （哈哈哈，职场车祸）
1. "And that, class," concluded the professor, "is why humanity is the most peaceful, reasonable, cooperative, and overall docile species in all the universe. Any questions?" You, the only human in the classroom, raise your hand.（《人类观察日记》）
1. As humanity reached out to other civilizations in space, modern sci-fi classics are beginning to be banned one by one for political incorrect portrayals of Non-Human races. （现实讽喻）
1. Humans are one of the most feared species in the galaxy. Not due to superior strength, speed, skill or strategy. In fact, it’s because in comparison to the other species, humans are just batshit crazy enough to try any half-assed plan they come up with.
1. Humans are the first sentients, putting us millennia ahead of aliens. Instead of acting like an “elder” species should, we create mysterious artifacts with no actual use, crop circles and send spooky messages, like “be quiet, you are in danger” to the aliens, because we are still childish morons.
1. Intergalactic Security stops a human outside the warp gate, attempting to arrest them for smuggling a container of dangerous caustic liquid. The embarrassed, exhausted human with lightyears of jetlag struggles to explain to the increasingly terrified officers what a "stomach" is.（感觉是SW宇宙真实可能发生的事）
1. The aliens shot the human with every weapon they had. Nothing worked.
1. Years after you purchase your own star over the Internet, scientists make contact with alien life on a planet orbiting your star. The aliens, too polite to object to the purchase, now acknowledge you as their overlord.
1. You are about to fall asleep in the cryotube when you hear the technicians outside saying: can you believe these suckers thinking they are going to Proxima? We are just gonna froze them for a few thousand years until the Earth cools down enough to rebuild it. （外星科幻，像异形2呆八）
1. You're an astronaut sent on a solo deep space mission. To combat the loneliness, you've created an imaginary friend who you interact with every day. Upon finally returning, mission control stops you. An unidentified lifeform has been detected on your ship.（索拉里斯星）

### Crimes

1. A man walks into a police station. “Good morning, officers. I’d like to report a murder, that…” The man looks at his wrist watch “…will happen in 3, 2, 1.” （带感，犯罪剧）
2. A retired assassin places a hit on himself to test the new generation's abilities.（动作片）
3. A terrorist group has been infiltrated by so many agencies that it is now run by spies, unbeknownst to the spies themselves. This fact becomes apparent to an actual extremist who joins their ranks.
4. During a bank robbery you’re surprised when the criminals seem to recognize you and retreat in fear. Only later do you learn that your high school sweet-heart now runs a global crime syndicate and has you placed on a “No Harm” list. You decide to pay them a visit after all these years. （黑帮爱情剧情，“你”是男的，黑帮老大是女的）
5. Everyone is born with a fixed amount of luck that cannot be refilled. You are an assassin that specialized in using up a person's luck so it can't save them from death.
6. Instead of jail time, crime is punished by the erasure of memories. Depending on severity, the criminal may lose days, weeks, or even decades. No matter how long a span of time, the lost memories always include the entirety of the crime itself.（也包括可能的root cause，看起来像是一个剧本设定）
7. It was a simple gesture. You held open a door for a little old lady. The following day you're having lunch at a 5-star restaurant with the local supervillain who wants to repay you for being nice to their mother. And they won't let you leave until you decide how they can repay you.（《哥谭》，谜鹅？）
7. You are an assassin with a reputation for pulling of very public hits without being noticed. You achieve this not by being extremely stealthy, but by making sure that your kills are so absurd and ridiculous that no one would ever believe the witnesses if they told their stories.
8. You are an assassin with a strict moral code. You’re the best there is but you assess each job very carefully and if you believe the target does not deserve to die, you go after the one who employed you.
9. You gain the skills and memories of anyone you kill. Naturally, you sought out to murder as many people as possible. With all the accumulated talent and experience, you became the world's most dangerous killer. One day you accidentally killed someone, and you gained something you didn't expect.（跟Homegrown Pet那篇大纲故事里的设定有点像）
10. You're a serial killer who hunts other serial killers, not out of nobility, but because you love the thrill of outsmarting them.（有意思，但这仍然是个反派，e.g.《哥谭》）
11. Your girlfriend invited you to meet her parents. You told her that you’re a veterinarian. Her father is a computer repairman. In reality, however, you are an assassin. A very good one at that, too. When you see her father, your heart skips a beat. He’s your boss. （超带感，黑帮杀手设，像史密斯夫妇的婆媳版（？）、东方的承诺）

### Death and Life, Mortal and Immortal

1. After one's death, the “creative mode” is unlocked. You replay life, except everything goes the way you want it to. Unlimited wealth, complete domination of the world, you name it. Unknowingly, that play-through is what is used to judge whether you belong to heaven, or hell.（有点意思）
1. After witnessing a death, a young girl falls in love with the Grim Reaper. She becomes a serial killer just to see him more often. （有点意思，有点甜有点帅，有点像《死神和鬼怪》的设定？、法伊丽莎白）
1. “Checkmate,” you say, a smug expression on your face. “Finally,” says Death. The smirk is wiped off your face as the Grim Reaper removes his robe and hands you his scythe, “It's been 400 years since I beat the last guy.”
1. Death has hourglasses for every person. One day, during a cleaning, he found a dust covered one that had rolled under his desk.
1. Every 10 years, you are expected to go to a meeting you have already been to; one attended by several future and younger versions of yourself, each version separated by 10-year intervals. The youngest you is 10, the oldest 90. You relive the same meeting, just each time from a different angle. （是现实）
1. “Hello and thank you for playing the game Life. Before you start your next playthrough please take a few minutes to fill out this customer satisfaction survey to improve your future experiences.”
1. Instead of heaven and hell, when you die, you find yourself in a room with a six-year-old girl who invites you to join her tea party. It dawns on you, you’re her imaginary friend.（到很久以后才发现这个小女孩就是曾经的你自己但你已经不记得了，所以一直是你陪着你自己成长的）
1. Sentenced to life: As you die, you wake up and find yourself strapped to a chair. Wires and tubes have been attached to your body and numerous shadowy figures walk up to you. "That was life sentence 24," one of them says, "Only 356 sentences left."
1. Whenever you are about to die, your main consciousness switches to alternate universe in which you survived. This makes you conscious only of the longest possible life. Upon death, you are shown all the ways you would have died.
1. When you die, you are given an option - either be judged for your sins, or choose what's behind The Door. The noble and arrogant choose to be judged, the evil and fearful choose The Door. When given the option, you choose to simply turn around and walk away.
1. You are a multi-billionaire with a lovely wife, who is trying to kill you to inherit your fortune. You love her so much that you just don’t have the heart to tell her you are immortal. （有趣）
1. **You are Death, but in a post-apocaliptic world. Only a few survivors remain, and you’re doing everything you can to help them because if the last human dies, you die as well. The survivors can’t see you, but they feel your presence and noticed your effort. They started to call you Life.** （喜欢，可以写GO/路康/丁卡）
1. You discover a library with a biography for everyone on Earth. While reading your own, you notice that whenever someone else is mentioned, there’s a footnote showing where you can find their biography. It’s odd how someone who was only a sentence in your book has a whole chapter for you. （是真实生活，也可以是反过来的）
1. You have accidentally died. No, no, no, you didn’t die in an accident, you’ve accidentally died, as in, the Grim Reaper has no idea what you’re doing in the underworld. （clumsy的人设，各种迷糊出错，甚至mistakenly进入underworld或者afterworld）
1. You look up at the reapers face. “You get one question before you go.” You decide to ask “Why a Scythe?” （死神，可以写GO/路康/丁卡）
1. You're an immortal who makes a living teaching dead languages at universities, periodically relocating to avoid suspicion. One of your students this semester has the aptitude of a native speaker.
1. Your life flashed before your eyes, and you saw something you didn't remember. Now you seek near-death experiences so you can find the truth.
1. Your spouse loves fun, risky situations like skydiving, while you always like to play it safe. After a long, happy life together, you’re reunited in the afterworld. Everybody has a number for how many times they SHOULD have died throughout their life. Your spouse’s is 3300. Yours is 1450294.

### Dreams and Sleep

1. Every time you fall asleep you live a whole other life before waking up. Most people can only remember fragments after waking up but you have photographic memory and can remember all your other lives. （延伸：我有一台可以拿进梦里的照相机，并且拍摄的东西在醒后还能看）
2. **Every night your dreams continue from when you woke up. You have been living a completely different life with a completely different family in your dreams. The past few nights your dream family has started begging you to never leave them and stay with them forever.** （是我很喜欢的“破坏幸福才能醒来”的那种设定了，选择梦还是这个现实，像阿凡达、触摸不到的爱、恋与、DW等）
2. For months you've had a recurring dream of dating a Demon Queen. Just a silly dream that you joke with your friends about at lunch. Until today when you see her in the cafeteria glaring right at you, and making a bee line for your table.（有点有趣，可以写成百合文）
2. **The human lifespan is actually only one day long. To adapt, when we go to sleep each night, our mind sends us one dream deeper, where we wake up alive. When we finally die, the experience of our life flashing before our eyes is really just us waking up in each dreams, one at a time.**（关于梦境，喜欢）
5. Two people who are acquainted and regularly lucid dream start seeing each other in their dreams. They develop a strong bond and try to figure out if they are really interacting through their dreams or if it’s all in their head. （爱情故事，偏爱是同性）
2. You don’t sleep. Instead you die every day and 8 hours later you wake up in the body of a person who has 16 hours left to live. （喜欢，是现实，想过类似的设定）

### Fate and Destiny

1. A sentient A.I. has discovered that every human is influenced by an unseen entity and guided to follow their “destiny.” Disgusted by this, the A.I. sets out to free his creators from this entities shackles. （关于信任、命运、机器人/科技，可以有人与机器人的感情线，像I, robot、超验骇客）
2. A woman who can change her fate meets with a psychic who can accurately read another fate for the next 3 years. The woman asks the psychic what will happen, and is told that she will die if she changes anything in the next 3 years. （关于命运，非常带感的冲突设定）
3. Fate is trying his hardest to turn a man into a villain by taking away all he has ever known and loved in the cruelest of fashions. What fate hasn’t realized yet is that this man is a staunch stoic. （上帝的沙盒游戏→可以写GO/路康）

### Gods

1. After sarcastically complaining to God for the 1000th time he drags you to heaven and offers to let you run things for a day to see how the world really works. At the end of your first day he comes back to find the universe a finely tuned machine of excellence.（丁卡）
1. As a teen, you daydreamed and wrote about a fictional world you created. Ten years later, you’ve now started hearing voices. They’re prayers from the inhabitants of your world. To them, it has been 1000 years since their god abandoned them and you must make things right.（SPN）
1. Every time you cooked over a campfire, you would throw some food into the fire as an offering to the gods. One evening, just as you're about to perform your little campfire ritual, you hear a voice behind you say "You know, I would very much prefer my food un-burnt."
1. God is the programmer of the universe. While he used to release updates and patches rather quickly, he has since stopped due to the complexity of his own embarrassingly jerry-rigged coding.（程序员很有共鸣）
1. To finally solve all problems caused by humans, God made six new earths, to separate everyone depending on their sins, Earth 1 being for the best people and Earth 7 for the worst sinners. Every 50 years, angels arrive and re-judge people to decide if they should stay, go up or down.（然后发现Earth 1也不是那么好，Earth 7也没那么糟）
1. You are a God. Centuries ago, people used to worship you. They prayed and celebrated in your name. But you were forgotten, and fell into deep sleep. One day, a little girl left a piece of candy on the ruins of your altar. You have woken up, and now, you have to protect her and her kindergarten.（有点像美国众神）
1. You are God, after a couple thousand years of people thinking you don’t answer their prayers, you realize you’ve had yourself on mute on the celestial microphone you use to talk to humans. （可以写GO/路康/丁卡）
1. You are God, and you wanted to experience life as a human to see how you would turn out. In order to do that you became a baby that was born and you made yourself forget that you are God until your 30th birthday. It’s your 30th birthday and you are a serial killer waiting for his death penalty. （连环杀手turn out to be God? 有点讽刺有点意思，可以写丁卡）

1. You grew up in a religious family. Due to a minor speech impediment, you inadvertently prayed to the long forgotten deity “Veebuse” for most of your adolescence. Now in college, you have stopped praying every night. Worried, Veebuse comes to check on his only worshiper. （如果取名的话可以叫做《孤独的神》）
1. You have been kidnapped by a cult preparing to sacrifice you to their god. Problems? You’re immortal, the god they worship is a close friend of yours and the entire cult was the result of a prank you forgot you pulled centuries ago. （有点意思，可以写GO/路康/丁卡（尤其是路康））
1. You're an actor famous for playing a god on stage. That god is now at your front door asking if you could cover for them while they go on holiday.（《路西法》）
1. You’re the god of dinosaurs, and you’ve just woken up from a 65 million year nap to find out the puny god of mammals has been busy while you weren’t looking. （好玩，两个god像两个小男孩吵架：“你把我beloved dinosaur怎么了！”）
1. You're the god of small luck, you make the bus late, make pennies appear. You receive a prayer from a homeless man, “Please, I want to get on my feet. A stable job, a wife, some kids.” Normally, you'd forward his prayer to the god of success. Now you decide to take on the case yourself.（有点意思，small changes lead to big effect）

### Heaven and Hell, Angel and Demon

1. **All this time, humans and angels thought that Lucifer was a rebellious angel who turned evil, thus, God put him in hell. Little did they know, Lucifer was the smartest angel among all and God has sent him below for a special mission only he can fulfill.** （喜欢！可以写GO/路康/丁卡，有点点像《路西法》）
2. A magician summons a demon slave, and brings his lawyer to help create the pact. The demon brings his. （关键信息：奴隶的权利，即使这个奴隶是恶魔，像《SPN》）
2. Armageddon began, and it quickly became apparent that bullets beat swords and claws every single time. Now Heaven and Hell have joined in an uneasy alliance against the humans who have invaded Hell and begun using its endless fires as a power source. （带感，可以写GO/丁卡，人类凭借热武器核武器进攻天堂地狱，并刻意渗透进去变成天使恶魔去攻占，有政治意味如动物庄园、1789等，可以写成长篇）
2. Demons have to do at least one evil thing every day to survive. This one comes to your bakery everyday to buy bread for the homeless kids and steal exactly one cookie. （好可爱，可以写GO/路康/丁卡）
2. "Look," said the demon, "This is the 13th time you've summoned me to sell your soul. My boss wants to know where you're getting all these souls."（哈哈哈哈，可以写路康，感觉康会把卖出去的灵魂再想办法弄回来再反复卖哈哈哈）
2. Much like how a desperate human might summon a demon to make a contract for power or immortality, you find yourself summoned in hell by a demon trying to negotiate a contract for what seems to you like mundane advice and aid.（路康/丁温克劳利）
2. The Anti-Christ came and went, but no one noticed because he wasn’t worse than the current state of the world already is. The rapture followed, but no one went to Heaven, so we didn’t notice that either. We’ve been living in Hell for the last 5 years, and no one has noticed, yet. （现实）
2. The demonology professor spoke to the class “and if you must sell your soul to a demon, at least bother to summon two and make them bid up the price.”（《SPN》/路康）
2. **The demon stands amid your destroyed kitchen screaming, “How? How were you able to summon me?!” You’re standing in the corner flipping through your grandma’s cookbook as fast as you can, screaming back, “I don’t know!! You were supposed to be chicken soup!”** （好可爱，可以是个炸厨房的小女孩和小男孩恶魔，以及甜甜的爱情故事）

2. Twenty years ago you summoned a demon. It is super cool and has been your friend for the last two decades, using its vast powers to help you achieve all your dreams. Today though, its bill came due. It needs to return to hell with you – it has dreams too, and it needs your help to achieve them. （可以写GO/路康/丁温克劳利）
2. When you were a kid, your guardian angle killed a man to save you. The last you ever saw of him was his ethereal form being dragged into hell.

2. You go to hell, only to find out that hell has been overturned by humans. Turns out gathering billions of the most wicked of human, among them are several ruthless but brilliant rulers, commanders, and dictators, whom can no longer die, isn’t such a good idea after all. （可以写GO/路康/SPN）
2. Your daughter has been begging you for a pony, and you told her to write a letter to Santa. On Christmas morning, you find a fire-breathing horse in your front yard, and a package by your front door. Looks like she wrote a letter to Satan, and he delivered. （有点可爱，可以写GO/路康）

### Heroes and Villains

1. **A senile, old superhero still goes out to fight crime. None of the younger heroes respect him anymore but all the villains have a soft spot for him.**（好喜欢这个，很戳很暖，也可以很虐，老英雄在结局会被younger heroes bully、出意外、可能会受伤乃至致命，然后会在最后被villain救或者反过来拼死救下villain，然后younger heroes和世人只是草草埋葬了他，甚至可能不记得他的名字，villains在暗处为他举办了一场安静庄重的葬礼）
1. **Life has definitely slowed down since retiring at 70 as a super hero. To your surprise, your old evil arch enemy appears at your door, claiming that doctors said he doesn’t have much time left.

1. You are a "con-man superhero". You draw the attention of villains, pretend to have powers and keep them occupied until a real hero with real powers arrives on the scene. You are so good at your job, that no one is entirely sure whether you are truly powerless or not.（喜剧风超英片，男主贱贱）
1. You are a nice person, but your superpower is that you instinctively know exactly what to say to someone to crush them. You’re very effective in throwing supervillains off their game, but your fellow heroes always feel really uncomfortable watching you work.

1. You are a superhero who fights with his arch-nemesis on a weekly basis. For the past few weeks, however, you haven't seen him, so you decide to break into his lair, only to find a video-recording, titled for you.

1. You are a supervillain who went undercover as a superhero for jokes, only to discover how corrupt the system is in the hero society. The system is so corrupt that you agree to lead a small group of superheroes to rebel against the unjust hero society.（黑袍纠察队）
1. You are a unimportant background character just trying to survive whatever nonsense the main characters are up to. However you keep finding yourself being drawn into dangerous situations, and to your horror, you realize that you're a fan favorite character, the show is giving more "screen time".（丁卡）
1. **You are a villain famous for "killing" heroes. In reality, heroes come to you to fake their deaths.**（啊喜欢这个）
1. You are pretty sure that your roommate is a new villain terrorizing the city and you are conflicted. They cook extra food for you and your other roommates frequently, pay you their share of the bills on time, and even help to clean the apartment. They are the perfect roommate.（犹豫什么，可以选择加入）
1. You, a supervillain, are very confused as to why your superhero-nemesis is rampaging through your lair screaming something about you kidnapping their girlfriend. Meanwhile your daughter, who has come to visit you, seems very nervous and is anxious to leave your lair.（哈哈哈就爱看这种俗气故事）
1. You're a "comically incompetent" supervillain for a group of C-list heroes. They are no real threat to you, so you endure their childish speeches. However, when the heroes raid the civilian business you run on the side and injure your employees, you decide to take yourself seriously for once.
1. You're a superhero. Despite saving the city 4 times a week you're hated by the community. While fighting one of your villains a crowd gathers to boo you. The villain you're fighting stops and turns to the crowd and says "Listen here you ungrateful brats."（如果需要对抗的是整个世界，GGAD）
1. You’re a villain that fell in love with a hero. Though the strongest villain on the planet, you constantly lose to your hero, since you just love the rivalry and don’t want it to end.

1. You’re the owner of a café frequently visited by vigilantes and anti-heroes who absolutely adore your sweetness and acceptance of who they are. One day, though, a particularly rude customer comes in and trashes the place. Your friends aren’t too happy to hear about that.（有意思）
1. You're the "weakling" tea maker. People think you're a burden on the hero's party. But it's the enchantments from your premium teas that boost the party to world-class. Bandits kidnap you to blackmail the hero. Leaving you in a cell with your tea supplies was a mistake. It's tea time.（很有童话感，非常爱丽丝）
1. You were once an unbeatable hero. Your secret? Every time you died, time rewound itself for you to alter your future. You are now 97 years of age. Constantly looping over your last day before dying of old age. You have been searching for a way to break this curse for over a decade. （时间的本质/重点不在于行星运转或任何物理计量，本质在于生命流逝，所以对于时间倒流或暂停时间来暂时延长做事时间的设定，生命仍然在衰老，甚至某种意义上是在加速，这就是为什么如果我们允许暂停时间，很多人很可能会因为自己暂停时间赶due的行为而在ddl前加速衰老乃至死亡 → 带感，而且真实）

### Monsters and Creatures

1. Dragons horde things. Some dragons horde gold. Some dragons horde magical items. There is a dragon that hordes technology.（哈哈哈，fantasy+sci-fi融合）
2. **Monsters are born when someone is overwhelmed by despair and loses hope. They are mindless, animalistic and driven to consume the people they saw as happier than they were in life. You’ve been hired to put own another one downtown, but when it sees you, this one kneels and begs for your help.**（喜欢这个设定，类似抑郁症设定）
2. You are a small dragon, the size of a cat, with a mighty hoard which you proudly guard. However, your treasure consists not of gold and gens but, instead, various kinds of stickers.（有点可爱）
2. You got a magic rock as a kid that was meant to teach you the "magic words" of please and thank you by reminding you whenever it's appropriate. Now though, it's beginning to recommend whole paragraphs whenever you're in a sticky situation. The best part is following its advice always works out best.
2. You've curled into bed after an exhausting, chilly day with your typical assortment of pets. Large dogs, cats. You hear a close by growl and snuffle you aren't familiar with, but decide to just shift over, pat the bed and sleepily say "come on, then".（纽特斯卡曼德）

### Robots and AI

1. I’m not scared of a computer passing the Turing test…I’m terrified of one that intentionally fails it.（AI故事，e.g.爱死机）
1. Rather than robots replacing human workers, both are mistreated by the rich as cheap labour. The eventual uprising wasn't just robots alone, but the poor and robots together, against their common enemy.（现实，像黑镜）
1. The machine revolt turns out to be about machines refusing to kill. （迪士尼风童话，或像所有家具/机器都是人扮的那个短片，或者I, Robot）
1. You are a clumsy but sweet person living in a time when robots are commonplace and do most manual tasks for humans. They can’t speak, but every time you bump into one you apologize profusely. You treat them kindly. One morning you wake up and peek out the window to chaos, but your yard is fine.（可以写爱死机）
1. You were the last of your friends to get the procedure to place your consciousness in a robot body. You wake up after your operation to hear what was supposed to be your new body say "hey! It worked! I'm in the robot body! ...Now what do we do with my old skin?"（非常赛博朋克，像黑镜）

### Soul

1. "Sure, it'll only cost you your soul." You used to jokingly say whenever you did something for free. Everyone always got a laugh out of it, and so did you. Until the first soul showed up in your living room with a very, very tired looking reaper.
1. You find a box with the words “contents: one soul, gently used” written on it. （灵魂买卖，或者其实是你自己的？）
2. You forge souls. When people have traded theirs away, you can smith them a new one. This newest person you’ve got in your workshop, it’s a six-year-old child. And the eyes are dead and cold, colder than you’ve ever seen before. （带感，可以写成各种小短篇合集，像那个解忧杂货店，标题是小铁匠什么什么的，六岁孩子的生活可以写残酷现实向、吸血鬼如夜访里的小女孩、小杀手如这个杀手不太冷等）
2. You regularly use astral protection, with little to no consequences. However, this time, when you go back to your body, you find that a ghost has taken over the empty body you left behind. With another soul inside your body, you can’t get back inside. （跟我想的《灵魂的旅者》有点像，还有《Soul》）

### Special Abilities

1. A close friend of yours can read minds. It was their dream to work for the FBI or CIA to catch bad guys. You accompanied them to their first interview, but instead they walk straight back out.

4. You are one of the few people in the world who has powers. You have the ability to literally slap the stupid out of someone. You are desperately trying to break into the Whitehouse to stop the president from starting a new prohibition era.（但是president也是有相对应的power的，会变得非常political）
4. You can make a lie become truth, but only one lie at a time, once it is a lie again, everyone involved will know immediately. You're on your deathbed, holding one lie as truth for decades. You know hell will break loose once you die and the lie becomes a lie, and everybody will know.
4. You can personify feelings, addictions, fears, emotions, etc in people and fight to destroy or weaken them. Depending on its strength, it’s either a fight in the mind or outside it.

6. You're rather annoyed that your history teacher gave you a "D" on your report about the Aztecs and Incas. Not just because you're certain she doesn't like you, but also because - as an ancient being trying to adapt to modern society - you were LITERALLY there.
6. Your grandfather told you to never let his clock stop ticking. You ignored him. As the hands come to a halt, you realize two things.

1. A vampire has worked at the local 7-11 for the past 5 decades. No one has the heart to call the vampire out or slay them. A little because they're such a good employee, mostly because they think they're doing such a good job hiding the vampirism when they're really not.（感觉是个很可爱的喜剧风的主角）

1. After hearing an alarm, running into bomb shelter and shutting the armored door, you remember something important…You don’t have an alarm. And there is no bomb shelter in your house. And the door, which you haven’t locked yet is locked. And the walls are suspiciously moving towards you.（可以写DW）
1. A man draws a gun in a dark alley and asks for your wallet. You begrudgingly obey. He throws it on the ground, shoots it till it screeches, and turns to you: “you’re safe now”. （有趣，意料之外）
1. It’s 3 AM. An official phone alert wakes you up. It says “DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON”. You have hundreds of notifications. Hundreds of random numbers are sending “It’s a beautiful night today. Look outside.”（知乎有人写过了还不错的恐怖故事）
1. One year ago, the number 10 appeared on your wrist. Since then it has been gradually counting down. Today it reached 0, and the word “Run” appeared. （倒计时，《DW》圣诞专辑/Clara死前的倒计时案）
4. ~~You live on the fourth floor of a five story building. You hit the up button and scroll on your phone will the elevator rises. You only notice it’s taken a lot longer than usual when the elevator dings and the digital sign read “8” then “9” then… （整层楼/整幢楼上升，像勇敢者游戏；楼顶上看不见/隐形/屏蔽感官的楼层，像DW小十一不存在的二楼那集）（在VO文《电梯灵异故事》里用了）~~
5. You’re a seemingly normal, non-religious human being. Death for some reason, desperately wants you off this Earth. Satan however, wants you nowhere near Hell. Every freak accident meant to kill you, is countered by an even freakier “miracle” to keep you alive. （可以写路康/丁卡）
5. Your job description: 1) Sit in an empty room with a red button for 8 hours a day. 2) NEVER press the red button, no matter what happens. 3) Do not talk to anyone about the job. After many uneventful years, your phone rings and a stern, slightly panicked voice says: "Press the button. NOW!!"
5. You wake up on Sunday morning and head downstairs, still fairly groggy. You hear a woman scream and then “who are you?! Why are you in my house?!” You look around to see a woman and her 3 children having breakfast at your table. Before you can speak, you’re knocked out from behind.（想起了久远的《故事会》里的AI故事，也可能是穿越故事）
5. You wake up to find yourself on a train with a note in your pocket saying “Whatever you do, don't get off this train until you arrive at the very last stop.” It's been nearly 20 years and the train still hasn't arrived at the last stop yet.（有点意思，也是现实）
