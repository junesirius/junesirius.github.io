1. If I major in robotics, a time traveler shows up to prevent a robot apocalypse; major in biology and it’s the same but with mantis men; archeology gets mummies everywhere. Screw it. “If time travel will exist, I’ll just do that. What could go wrong?” Everything went wrong.
2. Monsters are born when someone is overwhelmed by despair and loses hope. They are mindless, animalistic and driven to consume the people they saw as happier than they were in life.

35. Time travel is real and when you travel, you’re immortal until you go back to the present. There’s a catch, when you come back, you will look exactly like what you looked or will look like in the time period that you went to, making it dangerous to travel too far into the future or past. （有趣的设定，所以会如何选择，可以给男主增加决定的难度，比如在旅行之前爱上了女主，但是男主想要回到过去看父母车祸，女主想要看未来，像时间旅行者的妻子、本杰明巴顿奇事、恋与）

70. A senile, old superhero still goes out to fight crime. None of the younger heros respect him anymore but all the villains have a soft spot for him. （好喜欢这个，很戳很暖，也可以很虐，老英雄在结局会被younger heros bully、出意外、可能会受伤乃至致命，然后会在最后被villain救或者反过来拼死救下villain，然后younger heros和世人只是草草埋葬了他，甚至可能不记得他的名字，villains在暗处为他举办了一场安静庄重的葬礼）

123. You have weird super power. If you successfully talk someone into doing something, they will succeed, regardless of if the action in question is actually possible. On the other hand, your abilities to actually persuade people are unaltered.
124. You were once an unbeatable hero. Your secret? Every time you died, time rewound itself for you to alter your future. You are now 97 years of age. Constantly looping over your last day before dying of old age. You have been searching for a way to break this curse for over a decade. （时间的本质/重点不在于行星运转或任何物理计量，本质在于生命流逝，所以对于时间倒流或暂停时间来暂时延长做事时间的设定，生命仍然在衰老，甚至某种意义上是在加速，这就是为什么如果我们允许暂停时间，很多人很可能会因为自己暂停时间赶due的行为而在ddl前加速衰老乃至死亡 → 带感，而且真实）
125. Demons have to do at least one evil thing every day to survive. This one comes to your bakery everyday to buy bread for the homeless kids and steal exactly one cookie. （好可爱，可以写GO）
126. It turns out the lottery is actually a trap for time travelers. After winning, you wake up in a holding area, with a government suit trying to figure out when you are from.
127. Domino’s Pizza has offered free pizza for life to anyone who tattoos their logo on their body. Now other food chains are following that idea, but with increasingly absurd requirements, and the poor have turned themselves into walking advertisements just so they can eat with each passing day. （讽刺，现实，难受）
128. During a bank robbery you’re surprised when the criminals seem to recognize you and retreat in fear. Only later do you learn that your high school sweet-heart now runs a global crime syndicate and has you placed on a “No Harm” list. You decide to pay them a visit after all these years. （黑帮爱情剧情，“你”是男的，黑帮老大是女的）
129. About three years ago, your sister fell off the roof and stopped in mid-air. She was the first known victim of the Pause. As of today, almost 97 percent of the world’s population is Paused. （人类保护机制：每个即将遇到生命危险的人都会被pause作为保护，结果就是三年后97%的人被pause；“我”是没有被pause的人类之一，需要想办法同时暂停pause以及保护被解冻以后将死的人）
130. You live in a world where your soulmate is unable to hurt you, intentionally or otherwise. You are fighting in a war, when one of the enemy’s knives harmlessly glances off you. （喜欢！爱上对方阵营这种设定总是很带感，比如GGAD）
131. You are God, and you wanted to experience life as a human to see how you would turn out. In order to do that you became a baby that was born and you made yourself forget that you are God until your 30th birthday. It’s your 30th birthday and you are a serial killer waiting for his death penalty. （连环杀手turn out to be God? 有点讽刺）
132. You have accidentally died. No, no, no, you didn’t die in an accident, you’ve accidentally died, as in, the Grim Reaper has no idea what you’re doing in the underworld. （clumsy的人设，各种迷糊出错，甚至mistakenly进入underworld或者afterworld）
133. The Earth is a long running TV show that was supposed to end in 2012 with the Mayan apocalypse, but has been kept running due to its popularity. It’s going downhill fast. （有点像《楚门的世界》、DW关于50世纪后新闻或娱乐节目统治地球，但是重点在于going downhill fast，尤其是2020年，所以为什么质量下降，收视率下降会导致什么后果，关闭地球？）
134. There’s a city divided into 4 districts, govern by factions: knights on the north, pirates on the south, samurais on the east and cowboys on the west. And on the middle stands the only being that keeps the balance: the strongest and the wisest, the peacekeeper, and it’s you. The Bartender. （四种文化之间的冲突和调和，有点好玩）
135. Drunkenly, you accidentally pour vodka into your pet’s water bowl. As a result, your pet breaks the number one rule: do not speak to your owner…Ever.
136. The zombie apocalypse has come and gone. Humanity has survived and prospered, but with the virus still inside every single human. Centuries in the future, we are at war with an alien race, and they are horrified to learn that we don’t stay dead easily.
137. You are a spiritual null. Werewolves and vampires can’t turn you, fairy lights hold no charm, and you can stare at a medusa all day. This makes you the ultimate…fantasy lawyer.
138. Two men play a game of chess. One can read minds; the other can see the future. （暮光Edward vs Alice，也想过这个梗但是不知道怎么写）

140. You’re a seemingly normal, non-religious human being. Death for some reason, desperately wants you off this Earth. Satan however, wants you no where near Hell. Every freak accident meant to kill you, is countered by an even freakier “miracle” to keep you alive. （可以写GO）
141. You have been told all your life that you have a rare medical condition. It means you need regular special meals that your family has lovingly prepared. You now find out that your “condition” actually requires fresh human flash and your family have become serial killers to keep you alive. （《汉尼拔》？）
142. As a teen, you daydreamed and wrote about a fictional world you created. Ten years later, you’ve now started hearing voices. They’re prayers from the inhabitants of your world. To them, it has been 1000 years since their god abandoned them and you must make things right.
143. I’m not scared of a computer passing the Turing test…I’m terrified of one that intentionally fails it.
144. Armageddon began, and it quickly became apparent that bullets beat swords and claws every single time. Now Heaven and Hell have joined in an uneasy alliance against the humans who have invaded Hell and begun using its endless fires as a power source. （带感，可以写GO，人类凭借热武器核武器进攻天堂地狱，并刻意渗透进去变成天使恶魔去攻占，有政治意味如动物庄园、1789等，可以写成长篇）
145. A fortune teller foretold that twins would be born where one was evil and the other was good. A year later, a woman gave birth to a boy with horns and bat wings, and a girl with angel wings and a halo. The boy was sent away, while she and her husband raised the girl. They kept the wrong one. （可以写GO）
146. Life has definitely slowed down since retiring at 70 as a super hero. To your surprise, your old evil arch enemy appears at your door, claiming that doctors said he doesn’t have much time left. You two decide to spend a day golfing to reminisce about your glory days one last time. （喜欢这种反派和英雄温馨（但是也可以继续反水）的故事）
147. You’re the god of dinosaurs, and you’ve just woken up from a 65 million year nap to find out the puny god of mammals has been busy while you weren’t looking. （好玩，两个god像两个小男孩吵架：“你把我beloved dinosaur怎么了！”）
148.
