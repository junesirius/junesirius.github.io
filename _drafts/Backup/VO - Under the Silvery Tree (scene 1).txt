UNDER THE SILVERY TREE: THE FURTHEST DISTANCE IN THE WORLD
ACT I





FADE IN:

EXT. LAND AND WOODS, NEW ZEALAND - AERIAL SHOT - DAY

Miles of beautiful land of New Zealand gradually unfold itself. The trees are extremely green and lively under October sun.

The view is sliding towards the land, closer and closer, as if shot from a landing airplane.

EXT. OUTSIDE REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

A group of young actors walk out of the rehearsal room, chatting loudly. Among them is OLIVER LAMBERT, 22, attractive and bright, with a prop bow in his hands. Most of them are of similar age and height, including DOM and BILLY.

                DOM
    Have you heard? Peter said another strider is coming today.

                BILLY
    What do you mean? Another? I thought only one strider in the script.

                OLIVER
    Yeah, no, I heard they are replacing him, something about being too young. Poor guy.

                DOM
    It feels like getting fired for not doing your job right. Hope they won't fire me for eating too many apples on set.

They all laugh. Oliver's laughter stands out.

                OLIVER
    Still, I'm wondering what the new guy is like, you know, to look like a wanderer, but also has the blood of a king...

Oliver hasn't finished the sentence when PETER walks towards them, with a man behind him. THE MAN is around 40s, wearing ragged strider clothes with holes and patches everywhere. He holds a prop sword, looks like he just finishes his training.

                PETER
    Guys, meet our new hero, Mr. Vincent Amor.

Vincent shakes hands with them and greets them one by one, except for Oliver.

                DOM
    How do you do?

                VINCENT
    How do you do?

                BILLY
    I'm Billy, the hobbit...
        (re: Dom)
    The cleverer one.

                VINCENT
    I'm sure you are.

                DOM
    Hoy!

Dom punches Billy on the shoulder. They all laugh, so does Vincent. Oliver catches a glint of gentle smile that somehow makes his heartbeat fast.

Oliver looks at him, holding breath. Vincent is the kind of person you may not notice at first sight in the crowd, but there is something about him that makes you just couldn't move your eyes away.

Oliver realizes he has been staring at him for a bit too long. He quickly turns away his gaze.

                VINCENT
    You must be the elf boy.

Their eyes meet.

                OLIVER
        (amused)
    How do you know?

                VINCENT
    In case no one told you, you are glowing.

Oliver laughs shily. Vincent appreciates his smile.

                OLIVER
    I'm Oliver, by the way.

                VINCENT
    Nice to meet you.

Vincent holds out his hand. Oliver eagerly reaches for it to shake, didn't realize that he still grabs his bow. The bow and arrow almost stick Vincent.

                OLIVER
        (hastily)
    I'm sorry, I'm so terribly sorry.

                VINCENT
    It's alright.

                PETER
    Careful, don't murder the king on his first day. We don't have any more replacement.

Oliver hurriedly shifts the stuffs to his left hand and frees up the right hand to shake.

During all this time, Vincent watches his moves, smiling warmly.

THE END


FADE IN:

EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

ORLANDO checks his watch for the thousandth time, looking anxious, but not slightly impatient.

INT. AIRPLANE - SAME TIME

VIGGO sits by the window, looking at the approaching land, absent-mindedly.
 The plane is landing.

INT. AIRPORT EXIT TERMINAL - LATER

Orlando looks at the crowd walking out of the exit, then all of a sudden his eyes light up. He walks hurriedly towards Viggo.

Viggo sees him too. They rush the last few steps, and then hug each other.

                ORLANDO
    I didn't expect you'd really come here.

                VIGGO
    I didn't expect to be here, either.

                ORLANDO
    But you come anyway.

Orlando separates the hug. His facial expression cools down a little.

                ORLANDO
    May I ask why?

                VIGGO
    Well, you know, Henry wanted me to come.

                ORLANDO
    Oh.

He is clearly disappointed.

                VIGGO
    No, I'm joking. Because I wanted to come.

                ORLANDO
    You did?

                VIGGO
    Yeah, I read your script, especially the ending part. And I thought, well, if I come, then the reality adds to the story, it would be a perfect...

                ORLANDO
    End?

                VIGGO
    New start.

Their voices collapse together.

They look at each other in the eyes for a moment, until Orlando moves his eyes.

He pretends to cough softly, then speaks fast, as if trying to cover his tension.

                ORLANDO
    Yeah, right. New start, of course.
        (beat)
    So... what do you think? The script

                VIGGO
    I notice you used real names for everyone else, except for us.

                ORLANDO
        (anxious, avoid eye contact)
    I know, I just feel... I can't do it, you know, writing down real names -- your name -- and making up all those nonsense rubbish and everything. I don't know, it still makes me nervous, you know...

Orlando hesitates for a beat, and then says quietly --

                ORLANDO
    It took me almost two months to think of a name half as beautiful as yours.

                VIGGO
    The name "Vincent"?

                ORLANDO
    Yeah, you don't like it?

                VIGGO
    I didn't say that.

                ORLANDO
    That's a relief.

They fall into silence for a while, just walking side by side.

                VIGGO
    So... how long did it take? To finish the script?

                ORLANDO
    A little more than two days, maybe.

                VIGGO
    Two days?!

                ORLANDO
    Yeah, give or take. It all becomes so much easier to write about once I began the work, you know, like the memory itself is pouring onto the paper...

Viggo studies his face carefully. Those words are calm but the emotion can't cheat. Pain is invisible but ubiquitous. After all, Orlando is almost his age when they first met each other.

                ORLANDO
    Like the past is writing itself, like the words are squeezing out from my brain. They have been wandering for too long already.

                VIGGO
    You sound like a poet now.

                ORLANDO
    Thanks to you.

            CUT TO:

EXT. OUTSIDE REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

They just finish shooting the encounter scene.

                VIGGO
    I don't remember you being so clumsy.

                ORLANDO
    You have no idea how nervous I was at that time.

                VIGGO
    Have I ever told you I'm just as nervous as you are?

                ORLANDO
    No way.

                VIGGO
    Yes I am, at the very first sight of you.
