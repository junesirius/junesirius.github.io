I'm trying to write, I'm really really trying to write. But I can't, I don't know why but I can't. I can't write the first sentence. I know the story, but I can't write it. I don't know what Dean's doing, what Cas's doing. It's like I don't know them at all now. I got ten stories waiting to be finished but I can't work on any of them, so I keep adding new stories, writing new outlines, new prompts, new posts starting with "been thinking", but just anything to avoid having to really write a story. I don't know why. Maybe that's exactly why it's called writer's block. I want to write, but I can't. I feel like I can't write at all. But not writing is making me painful. I have to write to be happy. I have to write. And it's Cas's birthday, I got at least 10 days to write maybe just 1k word story for his birthday but I can't write anything at all, and it's already the night of his birthday, two hours to midnight to be late. But I'm sure Cas won't mind too much that I'm late. Guess that's exactly why I can't get this story out in time as well. But even late, I still can't write. I'm torn between can't write and have to write. I'm a machine that's clogged, ink congested, jammed, a printer that is haunted, not working, can't print out words, can't spit out anything, any story. Story is taken from me.

I thought it's because I'm lacking input, story input, word input, vocabulary input. So I read, I watch, I learn vocabulary, I do all the things that usually keep me relaxed and empowered, but I still can't write. Goddamnit, why is it so hard. I can't write a scene, can't write a sentence, can't write a word. Not anything under the "Main" section, but can't shut up if it looks like a summary and is under the "Draft" section.

Even tried to change the background color of this writing paper, just for a change, to relax the brain, to have something new. To have sea wave white noise sound and video kept in loop and played in a loop. Knowing watching the sea and duck pond could relax me, let me write, keep my brain quiet. Wear the best noise-canceling headphone in the world, get rid of sound of the world (though my heartbeat is still loud and noisy). Lie down on my chair, relaxed, comfortable, sleepy. I'm doing everything that used to work, but still, I can't put a single word on the opened document that I really, really should continue writing, or rather, beginning the first sentence. But instead, I opened another new irrelevant document file, just to vent for a thousand words about how much I can't write. Classic.

It's not like I'm losing interest or passion or love to my characters or my stories (well, some of them are indeed so long and I've forgotten half of them, I might lose passion a little bit in the sense I'm not in the "staying up whole night to finish it up state of mind", not until their ultimate deadline comes up anyway, but I still love them, they're my dear stories). I still love Cas so much, it's an important day for Cas, Cas might not realize that (that's so very Cas), but I know I should celebrate it for him somehow, and I know Dean would too.

Most likely it's still the anxiety, I think. Heart beating fast is the first and strongest indicator. Been having faster heartbeat when trying to work (or could be late night and sleepy and tired and really yearns for bed, and heartbeat really sounds loud when the headphone is on and you can't hear anything except for your heartbeat). I must be nervous about can't write a story as good as before now, afraid I'd disappoint my readers, the few people who enjoy my stories.

But hey, they like it or they not. I don't really care. They do what they do, like it or enjoy it or forget about it and move on with their life, whatever, that's what they do, and that has nothing to do with my words or my writing or me. Once the story is out of my hands, it's out of my control. Even if even I hate the story, it might still work. Remember, there's always some people love something. So there must be someone likes your work, so write for them, tell the story for the people who could enjoy and appreciate it. That's why you're writing, you're writing for yourself to express, to relax, to love and feel; you're writing for your characters, for them to live, to feel, to have different lives and chances in different worlds, to be them again, in a story that would have ended otherwise, but revived in your world; you're writing for your friends and community and readers who can enjoy the story you created, who appreciate your story, who love them even more than you do. There will always someone in the world love whatever you write, as long as you write them.

So, just write them down, for fuck's sake. Good or bad, who cares, just write them down. There's a story (or ten, or three hundred) in your head, you'd explode if you stop writing. So don't think.

Write.
