Dear Jared,

I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry, for all the inconvenience and intrusion of privacy. I didn't mean for any of that.

This is the first time I see you. This is the third day after I finished watching the whole fifteen seasons of the show. I was getting too emotional, so I just stood there, somewhere close to you, staring, watching, taking in everything you are, drowning myself in the moment of excitement and sadness, until I got driven away by the staff. I don't know if you noticed the insignificant me dressed as Castiel among the thousands of people that you were meeting with the whole day or if it's the crew that turned me away.

I was sad even when I was looking at you. Excitement and happiness surely were there inside of me somewhere, but the bitterness of knowing that looking and staring is all I can have is more deep and vast and heartbroken. Even the admission fee and cost for the trench coat isn't an easy decision, I couldn't have the luxury of spending more on autograph or photo op no matter how much I want to be close to you. And I had to take painkillers to even be able to leave the house to be there with you.

So I did the only thing I thought I would be allowed to do: looking and staring, and taking long-distance blurry photos so I could relive the moment when I forget what else in the world is worth living for (Sorry, I promised myself to not let my depression speaks but here it is, "I haven't finished Supernatural" has been the reason I gave myself to continue hanging on to the life, now that I finished it, meeting you guys becomes the next one). Time went by so slowly when I was just watching you talking with other people, laughing, chatting, signing. So joyful, so much love, so compassionate, so Sam Winchester, so... normal. Many times, I wanted to cry. I feel myself so out of place, I didn't belong there, not in front of you in the lines of people waiting to see you, not in the comic con, not in this country, or even this world. I don't belong anywhere.

Then I thought, that must be a large reason why I feel so connected with Castiel, why I dressed like him to give myself some comfort, to allow myself to legitimately feel out of place and lonely. It must be just how Cass felt among human beings. Mary asked him "When did it start to feel you fit, like you belong?" and he answered "I'm still not sure I do." (S12E03) I feel the same all the time. I always feel, as if I'm just trying to mimic what other humans are doing, I'm trying to pretend to be one of them, but no matter how hard I try, I can't understand all the rules, I can't be one of them, I never will be. I was always good at following orders and rules, I never wanted to cause trouble, but only when I could figure out the rules. There were so many implicit rules in this society that is so subtle and culturally different that tripped me over without knowing.

It took me a really long time to try to figure out why the staff seemed angry or uncomfortable at me being there, and maybe so were you (or maybe it's my imagination, I'd never know). They said I wasn't allowed to be there or take videos (which I never did), but I didn't know if it was because I stood in the wrong place or stood there too long or shouldn't take photos of you or just, everything about my existence is just always seem wrong. I never found any of those rules on the convention rule page. I guess I'm still not quite clear -- I feel just as confused and hurt as Cass was whenever it came to the intricate human interaction rules and others would mock but he just tilted his head in pure confusion. But judging by the staff's expression, at least I got that something I did violate something, and that was unwelcoming. So I deeply apologize. I feel ashamed.

I understand what Cass meant about "Happiness is not in the having, it's in just being" now. I'll be content just being with you in the same room in the same world, regardless of whether you ever notice me or not, whether we talk or not, whether you smile at me or not, or if you would ever even read this far until this line. It's okay. It doesn't matter. I'm at peace with myself now. I can be happy just by knowing that I love you.

Thank you, for being Sam Winchester. Thank you for just being there, and letting me know there is something in the world worth living for and fighting for and dying for.

"What do you say?" Jack asked. And you answered, "You say thank you. And you say you're sorry... You say goodbye." (S13E01)

So. Thank you. I'm sorry. Goodbye.

<br>

love for a thousand times,

\[Your Name\]
