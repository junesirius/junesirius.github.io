I'm feeling bad today, right after getting out of the bed, or even before that. I'm worrying about too much things. Thoughts are racing inside my mind, all kinds of thoughts, among which worries and self-critical thoughts are most distinctive.

I'm worrying about the future, about what I can do, what I will do, how can I achieve what I want, whether or not I will have to choose a career just for money, can I do what I want to do, or even, do I really know what I want to do and what I like. I constantly doubt whether the current choice is right, and whether those self-critical thoughts about whether I really am suitable for this program are right. Those thoughts hurt me, but I keep thinking about them, and most time, agree with the self-doubts and think I'm incapable. I know why I stick to the dream for so long, and I know how desperate I want to achieve it, but still, I have those doubts, and I truly believe that, the answer could be negative, could be that I'm really not the research type. The distance between what I want to achieve and what I can achieve, the doubt about my own ability, is what too easily tear me apart. I hate to admit I can't do something, for too long since childhood I already form the habit to know I can do anything I want, but yet, I never stop self-doubting. 

Everyone who knows me said that my only biggest enemy is myself, and that the only one thinks that I can't achieve my dream is myself. And yet, I would argue that's because no one knows me as good as myself, so I would be the only one who could see all the shortcomings, all the flaws, all the bad habits deep down in me, all the elements that would lead towards failure. 

I feel trapped, but I'm not so sure whether me or the life or the world is the one who build this cage. The other night, I feel I can see the cage, so clearly. I can see the iron wires around the cage, I can see myself crawling at the bottom of the cage, hold my own knees, curl like a new-born baby. I can see the cage hanging high above the sea. This is a world of sea, with nothing else. So there I am, inside of that tiny iron cage, hanging high above the sea, all alone. I would say it should be considered fortunate if the cage is just hanging there. But no, it's dropping, bit by bit, it's getting closer to the surface of the sea. And it's continue dropping, until falling into the sea, and continue sinking. I can see myself inside of the cage and have nowhere to flee. Beneath the sea, the remaining time of life that I could have, is the time of my last breath. There I am, I'm breathing my last breath, knowing that at the end of that breath, if I still cannot flee from the cage (which is almost for certain), that is the end of everything.

The vision and all the sense are too clear. I can sense the smell of the sea, I can feel the touch of the iron wire of the cage. And yet, I have no idea of how I can get away from the cage. There is no door, no window, no way out and no way in, as if I grow with the cage, I was inside of it from the very first day of my life and until my very last. So the end, also means the freedom. I'm not saying I'm going to seek this kind of freedom actively, but still, I will be looking for some form of freedom, one way or another.
