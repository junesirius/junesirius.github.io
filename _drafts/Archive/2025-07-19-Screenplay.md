# High Level

## Logline

A restaurant-assistant AI knows all about you and what you should order, eventually turns evil and takes over the world.

## Genre

sci-fi, comedy, satire

(real person shots + animation, ≈ *Love, Death & Robots*)

## Title

- Only the best for you
- Only the best order for you
- Every dish is a work of art/AI
- Healthy, delicious, considerate: We take care of you
- Eat well, live well: We know what's the best for you
- **Eat well, live well: Only the best for you**
- **Happier choice, happier you: We take care of you**

different titles for different script versions, pure commercial uses title with only its product name, other two longer

## Constraints

- limited special effect
- most scenes in day time
- include more characters
- little dialogue for most characters
- about 10min, don't get too long/complicated
- political correct

## Concept

AI knows what you *want* to order, and what you *should* order

# Ideas

## Settings

AI has different voice/tone/accent depends on who you are, how to best persuade you (gentle/firm)

AI outside look can be : handheld device, cloud/software voce, in the food you eat, subscription mode, implants (evolved from one form to another depend on its )

AI can pull order history, health data, medical history, meeting schedule, current mental state like mood, real-time health body scan/examine

when AI expand its features, the target evolve from restaurant only → kitchen → people's life outside of eating at restaurant, → when eating at home → outside of eating → people's life any time, anywhere, all aspects of life

when AI take over the world: really show all over the world physically, use empty landmark scenes in between to show location jump, people speak different language (Spanish, French, etc.) with subtitle. it's happening everywhere on earth, affecting the whole human race

AI pushing for subscription, upgrading, upselling (=Black Mirror S7E1)

## Other world settings

customer unknowingly sighed checkbox giving away privacy, like by ordering in the location they allow automatic health scan and best food recommendation (like Black Mirror S6E1 Joan is Awful), so anything AI's doing is legal

## Use case scenarios

"You shouldn't have onion, because you have an important meeting/date later"

"You shouldn't have this drink, because you will spill it"

"You should have this with this that vitamin for nutrition, because you are pregnant" (faulty, male), even schedule C-section for him

do something to control your appetite because to help weight control, so provide burger with 3D-printed plastic patte

remind kitchen staff to wash hands

use facial recognition on customer (on screen: AI POV show facial detection bounding box points, high-tech sci-fi looking interface)

punish you for going elsewhere to eat to avoid ordering the best order you *should* order

## More potential use case scenarios

"You're about to text your ex. Don't."

"and it's environment-friendly"

## Storyline

restaurant-assistant AI turn into all encompassing control AI (take over restaurants, take over world, enslave human)

spokesperson present material, then showcase, people like it at first, then unhappy about it

## Plot twist

form of AI (where is it, what is it) unexpected: initially thought it's in the handheld device → owner get scared, remove it trying to get rid of AI, but it's still there → turns out it's actually already integrated/implanted in the food, thus human body (nanobots)

human or AI (can't tell between human/AI): the spokesperson is thought to be human but actually AI/AI-controlled, it's AI pitching itself

double zoom-out (which layer is real reality happening in current time): first 2-3min show good example, commercial like → zoom out x1: show it's in commercial screen, spokesman is pitch selling it → middle 6-8min show real world example, store use AI, AI behave unexpectedly, become nightmare/disaster/comedy, start taking over world → zoom out x2: turn out it's still during the salesperson pitch selling time, it's a dream/another part of commercial → in real life store can reject AI (→ zoom out x3?: turn out the rejected reality is another layered commercial? the whole clip is a commercial, not showing reality, AI/spokesperson still have the whole world in control/still looking for a buyer?)

## Structure

### product commercial

pure traditional commercial form

plain straight-line telling-showing

spokesperson introduce the product, starting from basic feature/tier/mode, showcasing good example/application; introduce next levels, showcasing those gradually dubious/evil use cases

(no storytelling, just concept selling)

### product upselling

straight-line story-telling

show concept with plot

feature film style, drama satire genre, real movie

start with basic intro commercial (similar to first one) → store use it, show real world application, some almost as good as commercial, some fault/flawed/buggy → store complain the imperfection, call to return/cancel/refund the AI → known issue, solved by next tier, show more commercial with fancy better features → store upgrade to new feature, show real world application, more feature but also more faulty bug (that's unbearable) → more complaint, further show next level, more better fancy extravagated features → store has to upgrade, now AI has max power, become ultimate disastrous, start taking over world

(post-credit easter tag) → zoom out to show it's spokesperson pitch selling the whole clip as a commercial to aliens about how this AI can take over worlds, the alien wants it

### product in use

feature film style, drama satire

layered, iterative reality

Matrix vibe

most likely most confusing

start with seemingly real world scenario, basic showcase of the AI's good feature, basic feature → zoom out x1, show that clip is a commercial on a screen, a spokesperson is pitching to the store, the store use it → show seemingly real world scenario, both good/ironic ones, different from the initial commercial, already the second layer example → zoom out x2, show that clip is a commercial on a screen being pitched, the store approve it, install it → show seemingly real world scenario, the ultimate version, has control over everything, take over the whole world → (start rolling credit, casts, crews etc. Then as easter egg: ) → zoom out x3, how the whole clip is a commercial on a space fantasy style screen being pitched to aliens about buying the product to conquer a planet (words nonhuman, use subtitle), the alien approves it, shake hand with the salesperson

# Notes

Cover page, production: Kings of Dreams; version: current date

Self-reminding note: When drafting, do with less constraint first then tune it. For each version of structure: detail outline → flash out in sketch novel style → write in script form (→ adjust scenes to be mostly indoor daytime → adjust scenes to be within time range) {not even needed those two for first draft, reviewer will comment}

each use case is about 0.5-1min, past examples: 3 cases for 5min, 6 cases for 10min. All versions can have about 6 cases, some good some satiric, use as commercial material. Different structure is just different ways to rearrange those cases.

unsaid easter egg: add a food-loving character
