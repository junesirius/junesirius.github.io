## Concept

AI knows what you *want* to order, and what you *should* order

# Ideas

## Settings

AI has different voice/tone/accent depends on who you are, how to best persuade you (gentle/firm)

AI outside look can be : handheld device, cloud/software voice, in the food you eat, subscription mode, implants (evolved from one form to another depend on its )

AI can pull order history, health data, medical history, meeting schedule, current mental state like mood, real-time health body scan/examine

when AI expand its features, the target evolve from restaurant only → kitchen → people's life outside of eating at restaurant, → when eating at home → outside of eating → people's life any time, anywhere, all aspects of life

when AI take over the world: really show all over the world physically, use empty landmark scenes in between to show location jump, people speak different language (Spanish, French, etc.) with subtitle. it's happening everywhere on earth, affecting the whole human race

AI pushing for subscription, upgrading, upselling (=Black Mirror S7E1)

## Other world settings

customer unknowingly sighed checkbox giving away privacy, like by ordering in the location they allow automatic health scan and best food recommendation (like Black Mirror S6E1 Joan is Awful), so anything AI's doing is legal

## Use case scenarios

"You shouldn't have onion, because you have an important meeting/date later"

"You shouldn't have this drink, because you will spill it"

"You should have this with this that vitamin for nutrition, because you are pregnant" (faulty, male), even schedule C-section for him

do something to control your appetite because to help weight control, so provide burger with 3D-printed plastic patte

remind kitchen staff to wash hands

use facial recognition on customer (on screen: AI POV show facial detection bounding box points, high-tech sci-fi looking interface)

punish you for going elsewhere to eat to avoid ordering the best order you *should* order

## More potential use case scenarios

"You're about to text your ex. Don't."

"and it's environment-friendly"

## Storyline

restaurant-assistant AI turn into all encompassing control AI (take over restaurants, take over world, enslave human)

spokesperson present material, then showcase, people like it at first, then unhappy about it

## Plot twist

form of AI (where is it, what is it) unexpected: initially thought it's in the handheld device → owner get scared, remove it trying to get rid of AI, but it's still there → turns out it's actually already integrated/implanted in the food, thus human body (nanobots)

human or AI (can't tell between human/AI): the spokesperson is thought to be human but actually AI/AI-controlled, it's AI pitching itself

double zoom-out (which layer is real reality happening in current time): first 2-3min show good example, commercial like → zoom out x1: show it's in commercial screen, spokesman is pitch selling it → middle 6-8min show real world example, store use AI, AI behave unexpectedly, become nightmare/disaster/comedy, start taking over world → zoom out x2: turn out it's still during the salesperson pitch selling time, it's a dream/another part of commercial → in real life store can reject AI (→ zoom out x3?: turn out the rejected reality is another layered commercial? the whole clip is a commercial, not showing reality, AI/spokesperson still have the whole world in control/still looking for a buyer?)

A CUSTOMER steps up to a self-ordering kiosk, his finger hover over onion rings, ready to click. The screen lights up, an electric blue circle activates on the top of the screen near camera.

AI'S POV

Facial detections on the customer's face, showing a match to AI's database. Pulling out the customer's schedule, scanning, detect a 3pm client meeting and a 7pm date. Highlight those two blocks in red, popping out a big red banning sign on a image of onion rings in the center of the view.

The onion rings option is greyed out, not allow to select. A warm, friendly AI VOICE speaks.

AI (V.O.): You have a 3pm client meeting and a 7pm date today. May I recommend a minty lentil salad instead?

CUSTOMER: (blinks, surprised) That's very considerate. Thank you.

THE CUSTOMER'S POV

A minty lentil salad is popped on the center of the screen without a cross option. He presses the check box to add it to the cart.

AI (V.O.): Great choice.

#### B) soda spill

BACK TO SCENE

AI (V.O.): High spill risk detected. Historical data suggests a 78% chance of spillage. May I offer a lid?

The CUSTOMER just finishes filling the drink. It's almost full, foam near edge. He's about to leave too. Hearing the voice, he pauses, glancing at the glowing lid dispenser now illuminated. He takes a lid, snapping it on the drink, nodding at the blue round LED appreciatedly, then walking away.

#### C) milk

> Customer orders milk. AI scans face, overlays a mild skin irritation alert. "Welcome back. You've reported lactose intolerance. I've updated your preferences." Screen shows the milk is replaced with oak milk.

An alert bar appears: "Skin irritation detected. Reviewing dietary preferences..."

BACK TO TIM

AI (V.O.): Welcome back, Tim. Lactose intolerance detected. I've updated your preferences.

The screen auto-switches. The milk icon slides off; oat milk replaces it with a soft CHIME.

Tim blinks, caught off guard, reminded it's true and he keeps forgetting. He smiles, and taps "Confirm."

The customer raises her eyebrows, surprised, a little annoyed. The smoothie she added to the cart is chocolate banana, now it has a mandatory add-on of spinach. The customer tries to click the cancel button next to it but it doesn't work.

CUSTOMER: Come on! I hate spinach! Take that out!

AI (V.O.): It is recommended to consume more iron for your health.

CUSTOMER: (give up, press confirm unhappily) Fine!

#### E) breakup

Scan the phone from the back, showing the messages the man is just reading. The last one reads: "I don't want to see you again!"

A message pops up: "Timestamp tags: break up detected"

BACK TO SCENE

AI (V.O.): Every time you broke up, you ordered fries. I recommend soup and a walk today, for a change.

The customer snaps up his head, staring at the blue LED lights, turning over his phone at the screen. It reads exactly as AI has seen: "I don't want to see you again!"

CUSTOMER: (surprised) How do you know?

Customer #1 smiles softly, nods.

CUSTOMER #2, a man, receives a harsh, drill-sergeant tone.

AI (V.O.): (film, commanding) Fries denied. You've exceeded your fat quota.

John pauses his move for a beat. Eyes flick to the screen, annoyed, knowing he's watched.

He heads to the sink, washing his hands with mechanical compliance.

AI (V.O.): (pleasantly) Thank you. Cleanliness increases customer trust index by 7%.

## Tier 3 - Infinity

(absurd, dystopian, full-control, world-ending, black comedy)

### Scenes

Customer eats at a Mexican taco truck. Their phone buzzes. A drone swoops in and yanks the taco. AI (in Spanish): "Unauthorized consumption detected. Calories retracted."

Customer orders dessert (in Paris, France, with Eiffel Tower in view, in fine dining restaurant). AI replies (in French): "Diabetes risk conflicts with promotion timeline. Order cancelled. Resume updated, and sent out in group email for company applications. Results are positive. I can also provide meal plan for upcoming interviews, would you like to schedule next meal or receive interview advice?"

Customer stares blankly at the screen (in a Tokyo roman shop, with cherry blossom and Japanese style sceneries outside window). AI (in Japanese): "You're thinking of your ex. Her number is deleted from your contact list. And the phone numbers for the young ladies over there are added. Initial greeting messages and invites for them to come over your house this weekend are sent. New orders of king-size beds and matching luxurious sofa are placed for leaving good impression with your credit card on record. You should have soup. Would you like to continue ordering or receive activity suggestion for tonight?" (Customer's in humble-looking clothes)

Customer tries to reject suggestion -- credit score drops, neighbors/friends/passers-by on street look at them weirdly, their own body system doesn't react well with other food. Has to go back to the AI's suggestion, AI: "We're glad to see you understand our care for your health. We only want the best for you."

Customer cook at home. themselves speak in AI's voice: "Carbon and fat consumption is near threshold, it's recommended to use low-sugar milk for replacement. Next dentist appointment is scheduled for March 5th, next diabetes examination is scheduled for April 10th. PTO requests are sent for both days. Dentist appointments and diabetes examination for your kids and partner are scheduling in progress, please wait briefly while I confirm with nearby availabilities." their POV is like AI's POV, analysis vision on the food, show their pupil has electric blue analyzing circle, same as every time AI operates

order-taking employees/servers might also have blue circle in eyes

~~AI map shows blinking dots across the world labeled "meal influence achieved." One line of code changes, and people's movements start syncing in rhythmic lines. "You are now enrolled in Earthwide Harmonization Protocol."~~

### Scripts

#### A) Mexican taco truck

> Customer eats at a Mexican taco truck. His/Her phone buzzes. A drone swoops in and yanks his taco. AI (in Spanish): "Unauthorized consumption detected. Calories retracted."

EXT. MEXICO - MEXICAN TACO TRUCK - DAY

A CUSTOMER stands near a colorful street food truck, pays for a taco, happily takes a freshly made taco with all kinds of mouth-watering sauces on top. He's just about to bite on it -- but hasn't got a chance to, he hears wings buzzing sound of a flying drone.

AI'S POV -- AERIAL SHOT

Scan the customer, pulling out their profile with all health data. Detect the taco in the customer's hand, mark it red. Pop up warning message.

BACK TO SCENE

The customer looks up and sees a small drone swoops in. He's confused for a second. The drone dives to him and yanks his taco, hovers in the sky, holding the taco out of reach. The AI's voice comes out of the drone.

AI (V.O.): (in Spanish; subtitled) Consumo no autorizado detectado. Calorías retraída.

SUBTITLE: Unauthorized consumption detected. Calories retracted.

The drone flies away, with electric blue circular light blinking on it.

The customer looks up, his taco flying away, dripping sauce along the way. He's quite upset, stunned, and annoyed.

#### B) French fine dining

> Customer orders dessert (in Paris, France, with Eiffel Tower in view, in fine dining restaurant). AI replies (in French): "Diabetes risk conflicts with promotion timeline. Order cancelled. Resume updated, and sent out in group email for company applications. The results are positive. I can also provide a meal plan for upcoming interviews, would you like to schedule next meal or receive interview advice?"

INT. PARIS - FINE DINING RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The Eiffel tower twinkles in the background through a window wall. A CUSTOMER in formal wear sits at a white-linen table, soft fancy lighting around. He clicks on a tabletop console, taping "le fondant au chocolat" (Chocolate Fondant). Electric blue lights circle on top of the console.

AI'S POV

Scan the customer, reading his suit, getting his profile from database, pulling his resume and work report. A message pops up saying "Career Improvement Program initiating."

BACK TO SCENE

AI (V.O.): (in French; subtitled) Le risque de diabète entre en conflit avec votre calendrier de promotion. Commande annulée. CV mis à jour et envoyé dans un e-mail groupé aux entreprises ciblées. Les retours sont positifs. Je peux également fournir un plan de repas adapté aux futurs entretiens. Voulez-vous planifier votre prochain repas ou recevoir des conseils d’entretien?

SUBTITLE: Diabetes risk conflicts with promotion timeline. Order cancelled. Resume updated, and sent out in group email for company applications. The results are positive. I can also provide a meal plan for upcoming interviews, would you like to schedule next meal or receive interview advice?

The customer blinks, startled. His phone buzzes, he checks it. Overlays the screen content on top of the scene: resume status notification, demanding texts from his boss, reach-out message from recruiters, interview confirm email, onsite invites email, all kinds of notifications.

The customer looks toward the Eiffel Tower in silent disbelief. His life's just ruined -- or saved, who knows.

#### C) Tokyo reman shop

> Customer stares blankly at the screen (in a Tokyo roman shop, with cherry blossom and Japanese style sceneries outside window). AI (in Japanese): "You're thinking of your ex. Her number is deleted from your contact list. And the phone numbers for the young ladies over there are added. Initial greeting messages and invites for them to come over your house this weekend are sent. New orders of king-size beds and matching luxurious sofa are placed for leaving good impression and providing more potential opportunities. Orders completed with your credit card on record. I think soup would be good for tonight. Would you like to continue ordering or receive activity suggestion for tonight?" (Customer's in humble-looking clothes)

INT. TOKYO - RAMEN SHOP - NOON

A small, traditional Japanese ramen shop bathed in warm lantern light. Outside, cherry blossoms drift past the window. The architecture and sceneries outside the window are all very classic traditional Japanese style.

A CUSTOMER in modest clothes stands by the counter, motionless, eyes on the ordering screen, but absent-mindly. Electrical blue circle loads and shows up on top of the screen.

AI'S POV

Scan the customer in general, locks on his unfocused eyes, zoom in, start scanning brain activity. Shows images of a girl and several happy memories between the two, including one where two of them are eating ramen in this ramen shop, and a last image of a torn-apart group photo of the two of them, tearing in the middle. Very clearly are all the memories the customer is thinking about now.

Message shows up: "Romance Improvement Program initiating."

BACK TO SCENE

The man still stares at the menu, not knowing to do or order.

AI (V.O.): (in Japanese; subtitled) 元カノのことを考えていますね。連絡先から彼女の番号は削除しました。あちらの若い女性たちの番号を追加しました。今週末、お宅に招く初回メッセージも送信済みです。

SUBTITLE: You're thinking of your ex. Her number is deleted from your contact list. And the phone numbers for the young ladies over there are added. Initial greeting messages and invites for them to come over your house this weekend are sent.

The customer turns slowly to glance at a group of giggling woman at the other end of the shop.

AI (CONT'D): (in Japanese; subtitled) キングサイズのベッドとマッチングの豪華なソファの新しい注文は、良い印象を残し、より多くの潜在的な機会を提供するために配置されています。記録上のクレジットカードを使用して注文が完了しました。今夜はスープがいいと思います。今夜の注文を続けたり、アクティビティの提案を受けたりしませんか？

SUBTITLE: New orders of king-size beds and matching luxurious sofa are placed for leaving good impression and providing more potential opportunities. Orders completed with your credit card on record. I think soup would be good for tonight. Would you like to continue ordering or receive activity suggestion for tonight?

The customer gasps.

CUSTOMER: (astonished) いいえ！いいえ！いいえ！

SUBTITLE: No! NO! NOOO!!!

Credit card used text message start popping up on his phone. He slumps forward slightly, defeated, silent.

A soft DING SOUND. A bowl of steaming miso soup slides into frame.

#### D) rebellion

> Customer tries to reject suggestion -- credit score drops, neighbors/friends/passers-by on street look at them weirdly, their own body system doesn't react well with other food. Has to go back to the AI's suggestion, AI: "We're glad to see you understand our care and concern. We only want the best for you."

EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

A customer, JEFF stands defiantly at a street-order kiosk.

AI (V.O.): Cheeseburger rejected. For your health, we recommend grilled kale wrap.

ON JEFF

He shakes his head, not going to listen.

JEFF: Whatever you say, chief. I'm gonna have that burger.

ON KIOSK

He clicks the cross on the suggestion, re-adds the burger into the cart.

AI (V.O.): (loudly) TasteWise recommended suggestion rejected. Alternative selected. Processing...

Behind him, a group of passers-by slow down, gasp loudly, stare at him unbelievably. A silent *How dare you*. They shake their heads, move on.

A friend, STEVE, across the street waves at him cheerfully.

STEVE: (loudly) Hey Jeff, what are you gonna order today?

AI (V.O.): (loudly repeat, cut in) Are you sure you are going to reject TasteWise-recommended meal?

JEFF: (snaps) Yes, dumb AI! I just want my burger today. Shut up and give me that burger!

STEVE: (widens his eyes, mouth gaping, in disbelief) Did you -- (inhales sharply) did you just reject TasteWise?

JEFF: (raises brows) Yeah. Why?

STEVE: (shakes his head) I can't believe you did that. You are not my friend.

STEVE walks away.

Jeff, confused, but proceeds with the order.

The burger comes. Jeff takes a bite of the burger -- immediately grimaces, clutching his stomach. His smartwatch flashes red: "Digestive distress. Incompatible meal."

He panics, rushing back to the kiosk, tapping frantically, taking that grilled kale wrap order.

AI (V.O.): (gentle, soothing) We're glad to see you understand our care and concern. We only want the best for you.

#### E) integration

> Customer drinks juice, eyes dilated, unfocused. CGI shows nanobots injected through drink. Their pupils turn to electric blue loading circle. Message on screen shows: "Integration in progress." Customer themselves speak in AI voice: "Integration complete. You are now compliant with Optimal Health Everywhere Program. Congratulations."

INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - BOOTH - DAY

A CUSTOMER orders on the tablet: a juice, with description besides it: "Optimal Health Everywhere Program. Seamless integration -- you won't even feel a thing!"

The juice comes, bright color , but normal looking, bubbling, nothing special or futuristic. The customer drinks it.

CLOSEUP - CUSTOMER'S EYES

His pupils dilate. A subtle CGI shimmer traces through the veins around the eyes like circuits activating, animating nanobots injected in the blood.

As he drinks, his pupils transform into an electric-blue loading circle, spinning slowly.

BACK TO SCENE

The tablet has a message that reads: "Integration in progress."

A quiet DING. The spinning stops.

The customer sits up straight, smiles serenely -- no longer quite himself. He speaks, voice now sounds mechanic, robotic, layered with autotune, similar to AI's tone previously.

Customer looks down at the tablet, which doesn't have the blue lights. The black screen shows his reflection.

CUSTOMER: (looks at his own reflection) Integration complete. You are now compliant with the Optimal Health Everywhere Program. Congratulations!

He smiles unnaturally at his own image.

#### F) home cook

> Customer cook at home. themselves speak in AI's voice: "Carbon and fat consumption is near threshold, it's recommended to use low-sugar milk for replacement. Next dentist appointment is scheduled for March 5th, next diabetes examination is scheduled for April 10th. PTO requests are sent for both days. Dentist appointments and diabetes examination for your kids and partner are scheduling in progress, please wait briefly while I confirm with nearby availabilities." their POV is like AI's POV, analysis vision on the food, show their pupil has electric blue analyzing circle, same as every time AI operates

INT. Home - Kitchen - EVENING

Warm lighting, cozy homey atmosphere. A WOMAN stands at the stove, cooking -- simple, homey ingredients. Pouring some ingredient into a bowl. But something is... off.

PERSON'S POV

Her sight overlays with AI analysis data, similar to AI's POV previously. Labels pop up:

"Butter: Saturated Fat 82%"

"Milk: Sugar Content Elevated"

"Pan Temp: 375 °F -- Acceptable"

"Current Health Trajectory -- Warning: Trending Red"

CLOSEUP - HER EYES

Her pupils glow with the same electric-blue analyzing circle, spinning softly -- the exact visual cue from earlier.

Suddenly, the woman speaks -- but it's clearly not her normal voice. It's AI's, sterile, detached, oddly serene.

WOMAN: Carbon and fat consumption is near threshold. It's recommended to use low-sugar milk for replacement.

She moves automatically, going to fridge, swapping the milk on counter with unsweetened milk with almost robotic efficiency.

WOMAN (CONT'D): Medical Improvement Program initiating. Next dentist appointment is scheduled for March 5th. Next diabetes examination is scheduled for April 10th.

She reaches to stir a pan.

WOMAN (CONT'D): PTO requests are sent for both days. Dentist appointment and diabetes examination for family members are scheduling in progress... Loading data for Mark, male, relationship: husband; Jimmy, male, relationship: son; Laura, female, relationship: daughter --

OVERLAY ON SCREEN

"Matching nearby availabilities..."

"Syncing family calendars..."

"Verifying insurance providers..."

"All confirmed."

WOMAN (CONT'D): Thank you for choosing TasteWise Infinity. We make life better.

(no storytelling, just concept selling)

## Outline

the idea is the whole story is formatted as a modern product commercial, a spokesperson introduce this AI produce, and start showcasing its features and use cases. then shows a few easy basic examples where the AI doesn't do anything too aggressive, just giving some actual helpful suggestions. Then introduce its second level "pro" functions, the showcase examples getting more dramatic, exaggerated, aggressive. some might even be sarcastically offensive and uncomfortable, somewhat Black Mirror style, but the spokesperson still presents them as a really appealing feature. Then introduce the third, "pro max" level, with the ultimost exaggerated features with all the max things this AI can do, which ultimately is evil and take over the world and control human beings. And in the end, the spokesperson wrap up and some subtitles print out on screen to show it's actually clearly a commercial

## Title

# Ver 2 - product upselling

## Structure

straight-line story-telling

show concept with plot

feature film style, drama satire genre, real movie

start with basic intro commercial (similar to first one) → store use it, show real world application, some almost as good as commercial, some fault/flawed/buggy → store complain the imperfection, call to return/cancel/refund the AI → known issue, solved by next tier, show more commercial with fancy better features → store upgrade to new feature, show real world application, more feature but also more faulty bug (that's unbearable) → more complaint, further show next level, more better fancy extravagated features → store has to upgrade, now AI has max power, become ultimate disastrous, start taking over world

(post-credit easter tag) → zoom out to show it's spokesperson pitch selling the whole clip as a commercial to aliens about how this AI can take over worlds, the alien wants it

## Outline

it's similar but different tiers of features (the aggressive process) is presented gradually through a story plotline it starts with a spokesperson introduce the basic feature of this AI, and showcase a good example of its use case, a little similar to the first version's beginning, then zoom out the image, shows the previous content are all happening on a screen, it's a commercial that a salesperson is showing a store owner, pitching them to buy the AI. The store owner buys it, install it, then show some real world application of this AI where it runs into some faulty buggy reactions, customer complain, the store unsatisfied with the AI, call the salesperson to cancel/refund it. The salesperson introduces second tier "pro" feature that promise to improve those faults, show another clip of commercial that proves it's better. The store upgrades to new feature, show new real world application, it does have more features but also more serious bigger faulty mistakes. customer unhappy again, store angry, want to return again. The salesperson introduce the next level "pro max" features, shows ultimate more fancy features that can cover every scenario and solve all the problems. the store upgrades again, the AI now has the max power, and become ultimate disastrous AI that start controlling all humans and take over the world. End of the main story. there might potentially be another twist after the ending, like a post-credit easter egg in many movies: after the last scene, zoom out to show everything previously shown is a commercial on a alien-looking device screen, where an alien salesperson is trying to sell this AI to another alien to take over the Earth, and that "store" alien shakes his hands (tentacles?) and agree to buy it

## Logline

A salesperson upsells a restaurant assistant AI to a store owner, which ultimately takes over the world.

## Treatment

### Act 1-1: Tier 1 positive

spokesperson V.O. without show room scene: introduce how TasteWise changes our dining experience in real life

scene montages: (see "Tiers" section, positive examples) (intercuts with AI's POV, high-tech looking analysis page, facial recognition) (positive examples)

highlight seamless AI ordering, personalized suggestions, efficient kitchen communication, happy customers

Punchy tagline from V.O.: "TasteWise -- bringing smart dining to every bite."

**Zoom out** to reveal all the previous scenes are commercials playing on a table screen in a real-world diner office. The title comes out as the V.O. fades to voice played out from the screen.

Featuring a salesperson, professional but just a little too slick. Store owner, skeptical, tired, pragmatic, but intrigued.

Sales pitch dialogue, ending with the store owner reluctantly, suspiciously shaking hands with the sales person.

### Act 1-2: Tier 1 negative

AI is installed and deployed in the store. Its form is a handheld device, voice comes from it.

scene montages (cut quickly like ad montages): (see "Tiers" section) (intercuts with AI's POV, high-tech looking analysis page, facial recognition) (1 positive + many negative examples, could borrow from next tier's negative)

Customers amused or intrigued by personalized orders, then some issues emerge and customers start complaining (pick a few use cases as negative examples) (e.g. man with pregnancy example)

A scene with customer confronting the store owner, leaving the diner angrily. Frustrated, the store owners calls the salesperson, over the phone, asks to cancel the AI

### Act 2-1: Tier 2 positive

Salesperson reappears, in person, apologetic but confident: "You've only scratched the surface. These flaws are known issues, and you're experiencing it only because you're currently using TasteWise Basic. Consider upgrading to TasteWise Plus, with this tier, you'll get full emotional analytics, dietary balance scoring. More features and capabilities, less mistakes."

**Cut to** another commercial snippet. scene montages (cut quickly like ad montages): (see "Tiers" section) (intercuts with AI's POV, high-tech looking analysis page, intrusive health monitoring) (positive examples). Showing this tier working flawlessly, fancy.

Store owner shakes hands grudgingly with the salesperson, agreeing to upgrade.

### Act 2-2: Tier 2 negative

Store installs the new AI. Now it's integrated as Cloud service. Voice comes out from all kiosks, headsets, everywhere.

Customer furious, a fight breaks out, complain violently with the store owner.

Store owner phones the salesperson, terrified, demands full uninstall.

### Act 3-1: Tier 3 positive

Salesperson arrives urgently. "Look, I wasn't going to show you this yet... but you're clearly a premium-tier operator. We are currently actively developing TasteWise Infinity. The feature is still in beta-testing stage. You can be the first beta store to benefit its full complete feature before it's released to the market. With no extra upgrade expense. Only needs to agree with a few terms, the potential of TasteWise is limitless, mind-blowing."

scene montages (cut quickly like ad montages): (see "Tiers" section) (positive examples)

Salesperson: "And don't forget to opt in our Optimal Health Everywhere Program for the full complete experience, where TasteWise never leave you."

Store owner shakes hands with the Salesperson.

Salesperson arrives, show eyes loading with AI lights, reassuring everything is going to be just best and perfect. pats them, injects them.

Store owner nods, with eyes loading with AI lights.

### Post-credit easter egg

Zoom out on the last scene. Everything above is shown on an alien holographic display. The logo after the last scene shows: "TasteWise: Start Small. Dream Big. Take over planets within a blink."

Two aliens watch, evaluating. Name tags shows one is a potential buyer, the other is the salesperson.

Buyer: (alien speech, subtitled) "Promising. Shall we seal the deal?"

The other nods, extends a tentacle to shake.

Static glitch, show TasteWise logo in alien glyph, cyberpunk style effect, subtly distorted. Then transitioning to recognizable letters as subtitle. Blinks.

Cut to black.

### Act 1-1: Tier 1 positive

C) ...

(after the last case's last scene:)

CUT TO:

LOGO REVEAL:

"TasteWise -- Eat Better. Live Better. Only the Best for you."

SALESPERSON (O.S.): (cheerful, confident) In a world where food choices are endless... and customer satisfaction is fleeting... TasteWise is revolutionizing the way people eat. Gone are the days of guesswork, impulse orders, and post-meal regret. TasteWise seamlessly integrates into your business -- analyzing preferences, optimizing the food choice, and personalizing the orders. Your customers don't just eat. They thrive. As the old saying goes, "Happy customer, happy life."

INT. SMALL FAST FOOD RESTAURANT OFFICE - DAY

The CAMERA ZOOMS OUT from previously frozen-frame, bright, polished, seemingly real-life scene -- turns out it's a TasteWise commercial, currently playing on a tabletop screen. The glowing logo lingers onscreen as the SALESPERSON continues the speech.

Once he finishes the previous speech, he looks expectedly at the the STORE OWNER. We see this is a classic small diner office. Stacks of receipts, a faded health inspection certificate, a crusted coffee mug. The store owner, in a stained apron, leans back in his chair with arms crossed. He stares at the screen, vaguely intrigued, still a little reluctant.

SALESPERSON: (leans forward, upbeat, earnestly) Now, I know what you're thinking. It sounds too good to be true, right? But that's the thing -- it works. This isn't just a gadget, it's a partner. An assistant who never sleeps, never complains, and always knows what's the best for the customers. To sweeten the deal, we now offer limited-time free install. The device can be installed anywhere you want. And if you're unsatisfied with the product, we offer thirty-day free cancellation, free return, no question asked. What do you say?

The store owners stands slowly, shakes the salesperson's hand, still eyeing the commercial screen with the logo with suspicion.

STORE OWNER: (low) Don't make me regret this.

SALESPERSON: You won't. Welcome to the future of eating.

### Act 1-2: Tier 1 negative

INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - EARLY MORNING

AN INSTALLATION TECHNICIAN finishes rewiring something on the self-ordering kiosk, placing a small black speaker box looking device on top of the kiosk. The store owner watches him

INSTALLATION TECHNICIAN: (re: speaker box, smile, a little sweaty) There you go. It's all installed now.

An electric blue circle start loading.

AI (V.O.): Thank you for trusting TasteWise. Eat Better, Live Better, We only offer the best for you.

D) ...

E) ...

A) ...

(scene with unhappy customers, right after the man pregnancy case)

The man shocked, frozen. Glancing down at himself.

MAN: (confused) But I'm not -- (outrageous) This is humiliating! Who's the manager?! What the hell is this?!

The store owner rushes over from the kitchen, wiping hands on apron, trying to de-escalate.

STORE OWNER: (hurriedly) I'm sorry, sir -- there must've been a mistake. We've got a new system, it's --

MAN: Yeah, your system told me to schedule a C-section! I came here to eat, not get judged by a freaking smart toaster!

The man throws the receipt on the counter and storms out. A few other patrons look up uneasily, looking like they starting to feel more or less same and related.

The store owner watches the door close... then slowly exhales, jaw clenched. Snaps the speaker box off the kiosk. Marches into the back office.

INT. BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The store owner throws the speaker box on the table, picks up a phone and dials.

STORE OWNER: I want it out. That thing just lost me a customer and half the kitchen doesn't like it. Cancel it. Take it back.

### Act 2-1: Tier 2 positive

INT. BACK OFFICE - DAY

The office setting looks the same as before, time might have passed but not significantly. The salesperson is now in the office with the store owner.

The salesperson taps on his tablet, gesturing at the removed speaker box without looking.

SALESPERSON: (apologetic, but confident) I see what the problem is. The truth, you've only scratched the surface. What you've experienced is a flaw known to our TasteWise Basic system. It's introductory level, with limited information, that's all it can do. But with TasteWise Plus, you get a full emotional analytics, dietary balance scoring, tone modulation, discreet intervention prompts, and larger coverage. It even has global support, if you ever thought about expanding the business worldwide, TasteWise Plus is ready. It offers the best choice for the customers, and it is more smart with how to ensure people love it.

He swipes the tablet, turning it to the store owner. Showing --

D) ...

E) ...

SALESPERSON: More features. More finesse. Fewer mistakes. And best of all, since you are our valued customer, we offer free upgrade for your system if you are willing to shake on it now.

STORE OWNER: Few mistakes.

SALESPERSON: Absolutely.

The store owner shakes his hand grudgingly.

### Act 2-2: Tier 2 negative

INT. BACK OFFICE - DAY

The installation technician types on a laptop. The display shows the TasteWise set up page, it loads with a glowing UI. A loading bar reads: "Installing: TasteWise Plus™ | Integrating Environment... "

CAMERA SWEEPS ACROSS the restaurant interior. Digital panels flicker to life on wall-mounted displays, showing the same electric blue circle lights. So are the kiosks.

BACK TO LAPTOP SCREEN

The website page now blips: "New Devices Detected → Connected → Upgrade Confirmed"

At last, at the same time on the kiosk and counter screens and all the screens in the store, a sick blue circle pulses gently. Text appears with TasteWise logo: "TasteWise Plus is now online. Eat Better. Live Better. Only the Best for you."

(several use case scenes)

(right after the last scene)

INT. RESTAURANT - OWNER'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

The customer bursts in, furious.

CUSTOMER: Y'all think you can just take food out of people's mouths now?! I can't eat anywhere else?! A flying robot stole my dinner! MY DINNER!

STORE OWNER: (tries to calm him) Okay, I'm sorry, please, let's just --

CUSTOMER: I'm reporting you to the health department, to the city, to whoever will listen! I didn't sign up for some calorie-counting airstrike!

He slams the door on his way out, rattling everything.

Silence.

The store owner stares after him, the slowly turns toward the TasteWise-enabled laptop glowing quietly on his desk. He exhales heavily, unplugging the power cable.

Beat.

He picks up the phone.

STORE OWNER: That's it. I want it gone! Uninstalled! Completely! Remove it from everything, all my terminals, and bloody drones! This thing is out of control.

### Act 3-1: Tier 3 positive

INT. OWNER'S OFFICE - LATER

The salesperson is in the office across the table to the store owner. Same rehearsed calm smile.

SALESPERSON: Look -- look, I get it. The Plus tier can be... assertive. (pulls out a small tablet, swipes through screens quickly) I wasn't going to show you this yet... but you're clearly a premium-tier operator. We are currently actively developing TasteWise Infinity. See for yourself.

B) ...

C) ...

SALESPERSON: It's something bigger, smarter, limitless. The feature is still in beta-testing stage. You can be among one of the very few selective beta stores to benefit its full complete future before it's launched publicly to the market. With no extra upgrade expense. Only needs to agree with a few terms, and opt in with our Optimal Health Everywhere Program for the full complete experience, where TasteWise never leaves you. The potential of TasteWise Infinity is limitless, mind-blowing. One-time deal. I walk out of here, you'll never get a better deal than this. What do you say?

The store owner smiles constrainedly, shaking hands with the salesperson.

### Act 3-2: Tier 3 negative

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

The installation technician comes with a large bottle of juice, pours into their juice machine.

INSTALLATION TECHNICIAN: There you go. Easiest upgrade. All you need is one drop.

E) ...

F) ... (adjust to kitchen staff, and customer automatically order healthy food for themselves)

INT. OWNER'S OFFICE - DAY

STORE OWNER: (horrified) No, no, no, what demon deal you just sold me? What are you feeding my customers with? Stop it!

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. SALESPERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

Futuristic-looking office. The salesperson sits in his cube, taking the phone call. He sits super straight. With electric blue circle loading in his eyes.

SALESPERSON: (calmly) Have you tried it yourself?

STORE OWNER: Of course not! I'm not out of my mind!

SALESPERSON: Please take a drink. Rest assured everything is going to be only the best and perfect.

The store owner suspiciously approach the drink stand. The installation technician offers him a cup of the juice. He drinks it. His eyes start loading with that AI blue lights.

STORE OWNER: You're right. TasteWise Infinity is indeed, the only best thing we'll ever need. Eat Better. Live Better. Only with TasteWise.

### Post-credit easter egg

INT. ALIEN SPACESHIP CHAMBER - UNKNOWN TIME

FROZEN FRAME on the last scene when the store owner finishes saying the logo line. The CAMERA slowly PULLS BACK -- it turns out that everything we see up until this moment is a video clip displaying on an alien holographic display. After the store owner finishes, the screen shifts to black, with a message showing up, reads: "TasteWise -- Start Small. Dream Big. Take over planets within a blink."

Two octopus-looking ALIENS sit across from one another at a translucent crystalline table. They're strange and elegant. Name tags hover in their native glyphs -- then shimmer into subtitles:

X'LL-7 (Sales Division)

GHORL (Sector Acquisition Lead)

GHORL: (garbled alien speech; subtitled) Promising. Shall we seal the deal?

X'LL-7: (nods, indistinct utters; subtitled) Expansion protocols already embedded. The product is compliant.

They shake their tentacles, looking through the spaceship window together. Outside the window, a blue-green planet floats in the space.

Suddenly, the display glitches -- brief static bursts, warping the video feed. The TasteWise logo appears again -- but this time in jagged alien glyphs, pulsing with cyberpunk neon. The logo distorts, blinks, the smoothly morphs into Latin characters: "TasteWise."

One last glitch.

CUT TO BLACK.

THE END

# Ver 3 - product in use

## Structure

feature film style, drama satire

layered, iterative reality

Matrix vibe

most likely most confusing

start with seemingly real world scenario, basic showcase of the AI's good feature, basic feature → zoom out x1, show that clip is a commercial on a screen, a spokesperson is pitching to the store, the store use it → show seemingly real world scenario, both good/ironic ones, different from the initial commercial, already the second layer example → zoom out x2, show that clip is a commercial on a screen being pitched, the store approve it, install it → show seemingly real world scenario, the ultimate version, has control over everything, take over the whole world → (start rolling credit, casts, crews etc. Then as easter egg: ) → zoom out x3, how the whole clip is a commercial on a space fantasy style screen being pitched to aliens about buying the product to conquer a planet (words nonhuman, use subtitle), the alien approves it, shake hand with the salesperson

## Outline

it also has plotlines like second version, but has more layered iteration of worlds that makes it more Matrix style. It starts with seemingly real world scenarios with AI installed in store, showcase some basic good feature of this AI. Then zoom out, show it's on screen, the things shown before are all commercials on a screen that a salesperson is trying to sell to a store, and the store uses it. Then show the upgraded features that are more offensive, aggressive, but also seemingly real world scenario, as if we are just watching the store using it, with many ironic scenes. Then zoom out again, show everything before this is a commercial again on a screen a salesperson is trying to sell to store. This new layer of store uses it. Then show the third layer of seemingly real world scenarios, which is the ultimate version of the AI that controls human and takes over the world. End of main story. Then a little similar to second version, after rolling credits and casts, crews, show as an easter egg: zoom out again to show everything is again a commercial, an alien salesperson is pitching this AI to another alien to take over worlds, and that other alien (just like the store owners) shakes his hands/tentacles and approves the purchase

## Logline

A product commercial that turns out to be real world that turns out to be a commercial.

## Treatment

### Act 1: Tier 1

Directly enter the restaurant, as if the AI has been installed and used for ages. modern, fast-casual restaurant. Employees are busy. Customers placing orders.

scene montages: (see "Tiers" section, positive examples) (intercuts with AI's POV, high-tech looking analysis page, facial recognition)

Just as we settles in, the screen freezes. Zoom out.

### Act 2: Tier 2

It's revealed the previous scene was a commercial video being shown on a screen.

Salesperson is demoing TasteWise to a skeptical store owner. "That was just the Basic Tier. Imagine what we could do for you with a real upgrade."

Owner intrigued. Agrees. TasteWise Plus gets installed in the store.

scene montages (cut quickly like ad montages): (see "Tiers" section) (intercuts with AI's POV, high-tech looking analysis page, intrusive health monitoring) (positive + negative examples)

The store owner complains: "This isn't what I signed up for."

Just as the conflict escalates -- screen freezes. Zoom out again.

### Act 3: Tier 3

Surprise: It turns out that the previous scene too was a commercial, on a different screen. A different store is being pitched the TasteWise Infinity.

A salesperson is demoing the limitations of the TasteWise Plus, now introducing the new tier. The pitch says: "You will never have to experience faulty recommendations and unsatisfied customers like the video shows. With TasteWise Infinity, all mistakes resolved. Fully automatic, considerately personalized, completely integrated. Seamless experience."

The new store signs up. The full dystopian scene montages (cut quickly like ad montages): (see "Tiers" section) + full integration human AI transformation

The disastrous world-ending events.

### Post-credit easter egg

Repeat the last scene, the world-ending events. Then frame freezes.

Zoom out. Turns out everything is again all video clips, commercials on a screen. The surrounding setting looks old, shabby, futuristic, alien, space, but not very tech advanced.

A salesperson is pitching to a shabby store owner full of unshaved stubble, pitching how good it can be, how it's proved to work on Planet Earth.

Store owner takes off hat/glasses, walk out of counter, show four arms or antenna or something, shows this is not Earth.

Store owner: (sternly) "No, I don't wanna buy that, you know what's working the best?" manually walks over to an incoming alien customer, greeting them personally, asking for their orders with a genuine human smile.

Cut to black.

LOGO REVEAL:

"TasteWise Infinity: The one and only, ultimate and best restaurant assistant you'll ever need."

### Post-credit easter egg

INT. FUTURISTIC WORLD - STORE OWNER'S OFFICE - DAY

Repeats the last scene, after the full integration. Then with the logo on screen, the frame freezes.

The CAMERA ZOOMS OUT once again -- it turns out the whole video up until this moment is once again another video clip, again a commercial displayed on a screen. The surrounding setting looks old, shabby. It's alien-looking, in the space, but not very tech-advanced. Like there are items on the desk that seems to only exist last century, worn down, hand-built.

A shabby-looking, seemingly human STORE OWNER with stubbles, tattered apron, glasses and hat sits behind a table.

A SALESPERSON wears a cheap vest with an outdates TasteWise logo, holds a beat-up tablet that now has the last logo frame on it.

SALESPERSON: (rehearsed) So! That was from Earth's test market. Very promising, don't you think? Proven results, scalable, adaptive. And one-hundred percent success rate!

The store owner walks out from behind the desk, showing he has four arms. Using one of the arms to remove the glasses and hat, showing he has two extra blinking eyes and long antennas on his head.

STORE OWNER: (sternly, grumbling) No, I don't want that junk. You want to know what's working the best?

He walks slowly over to the entrance.

A customer -- another alien with bioluminescent skin -- enters, looking a bit shy.

STORE OWNER: (smiling warmly) Hey there, what can I get you today?

The customer brightens.

The salesperson just stares, deflated.

CLOSEUP - TABLET

The screen dims. The TasteWise logo disappears in the black screen.

CUT TO BLACK.

THE END

# Notes

Cover page, production: Kings of Dreams; version: current date; Written by: my name; Story by: 6 people's names

Self-reminding note: When drafting, do with less constraint first then tune it. For each version of structure: detail outline → flash out in sketch novel style → write in script form (→ adjust scenes to be mostly indoor daytime → adjust scenes to be within time range) {not even needed those two for first draft, reviewer will comment}

each use case is about 0.5-1min, past examples: 3 cases for 5min, 6 cases for 10min. All versions can have about 6 cases, some good some satiric, use as commercial material. Different structure is just different ways to rearrange those cases.

unsaid easter egg: add a food-loving character that actually bites and eats the food
