## Concept

AI knows what you *want* to order, and what you *should* order

# Ideas

## Settings

AI has different voice/tone/accent depends on who you are, how to best persuade you (gentle/firm)

AI outside look can be : handheld device, cloud/software voice, in the food you eat, subscription mode, implants (evolved from one form to another depend on its )

AI can pull order history, health data, medical history, meeting schedule, current mental state like mood, real-time health body scan/examine

when AI expand its features, the target evolve from restaurant only → kitchen → people's life outside of eating at restaurant, → when eating at home → outside of eating → people's life any time, anywhere, all aspects of life

when AI take over the world: really show all over the world physically, use empty landmark scenes in between to show location jump, people speak different language (Spanish, French, etc.) with subtitle. it's happening everywhere on earth, affecting the whole human race

AI pushing for subscription, upgrading, upselling (=Black Mirror S7E1)

## Other world settings

customer unknowingly sighed checkbox giving away privacy, like by ordering in the location they allow automatic health scan and best food recommendation (like Black Mirror S6E1 Joan is Awful), so anything AI's doing is legal

## Use case scenarios

"You shouldn't have onion, because you have an important meeting/date later"

"You shouldn't have this drink, because you will spill it"

"You should have this with this that vitamin for nutrition, because you are pregnant" (faulty, male), even schedule C-section for him

do something to control your appetite because to help weight control, so provide burger with 3D-printed plastic patte

remind kitchen staff to wash hands

use facial recognition on customer (on screen: AI POV show facial detection bounding box points, high-tech sci-fi looking interface)

punish you for going elsewhere to eat to avoid ordering the best order you *should* order

## More potential use case scenarios

"You're about to text your ex. Don't."

"and it's environment-friendly"

## Storyline

restaurant-assistant AI turn into all encompassing control AI (take over restaurants, take over world, enslave human)

spokesperson present material, then showcase, people like it at first, then unhappy about it

## Plot twist

form of AI (where is it, what is it) unexpected: initially thought it's in the handheld device → owner get scared, remove it trying to get rid of AI, but it's still there → turns out it's actually already integrated/implanted in the food, thus human body (nanobots)

human or AI (can't tell between human/AI): the spokesperson is thought to be human but actually AI/AI-controlled, it's AI pitching itself

double zoom-out (which layer is real reality happening in current time): first 2-3min show good example, commercial like → zoom out x1: show it's in commercial screen, spokesman is pitch selling it → middle 6-8min show real world example, store use AI, AI behave unexpectedly, become nightmare/disaster/comedy, start taking over world → zoom out x2: turn out it's still during the salesperson pitch selling time, it's a dream/another part of commercial → in real life store can reject AI (→ zoom out x3?: turn out the rejected reality is another layered commercial? the whole clip is a commercial, not showing reality, AI/spokesperson still have the whole world in control/still looking for a buyer?)

# Tier-based use case designs

Potential tier names:

- Starter, Premium, Complete
- Basic, Plus, Infinity
- ~~Input Mode, Directive Override, Omnivore Control Protocol~~
- Smart Nourish, Optimal Self, HumanOS Override

## Tier 1 - Basic

(helpful, mildly intrusive, believable tech AI)

~~A customer about to order onion rings. A friendly tone: "You have a date with Rebecca at 7pm. May I recommend a minty lentil salad instead?"~~

A customer reaches for onion rings. AI intercepts: "You have a 3pm client meeting. May I recommend a minty lentil salad instead?"

A customer gets a drink from self-serving drink stand, a full cup without lid. AI reminds: "High spill risk is detected. Historical data suggests a 78% chance of spillage. May I offer a lid?"

AI scans face, overlays a mild skin irritation alert. "Welcome back, Tim. You've reported mild soy intolerance. I've updated your preferences."

AI overlays customer's smartwatch health data. "Your iron is low. Adding spinach to your smoothie -- on the house!"

A customer is checking phone, face upset, orders fries. AI: "Last time you ordered fries after a breakup. I recommend soup and a walk today." customer shows his phone screen, a text shows he's dumped again: "How do you know?"

## Tier 2 - Plus

(controlling, pushy, manipulative, ironic, slightly disturbing, socially awkward)

Male customer orders sushi. AI says: "Raw fish is discouraged during pregnancy. C-section scheduled for August 14" (Text pops up: "Feature: AutoMedLink™ now syncing with nearby hospital.") Customer stunned, spokesperson smiles

Burger delivered. Customer bites -- it's rubbery. Spits it. "This meal includes ZeroCal™ 3D-printed plant polymer patties. Digestive stimulation, no weight gain! You're now on-track for summer body goal!"

Two customers side by side. One gets a gentle soothing British voice: "Perhaps you'd enjoy a calming herbal tea." The other gets a drill-sergeant tone: "Fries denied. You've had three cheat days."

Customer gets denied dessert. AI says: "Your Hinge date ends at 9:12 pm. Dessert will increase bloating probability by 42%, exceeding success threshold. Order declined."

## Tier 3 - Infinity

(absurd, dystopian, full-control, world-ending, black comedy)

Customer eats at a Mexican taco truck. His/Her phone buzzes. A drone swoops in and yanks his taco. AI (in Spanish): "Unauthorized consumption detected. Calories retracted."

Customer orders dessert (in French, with Eiffel Tower in view, in fine dining restaurant). AI replies (in French): "Diabetes risk conflicts with promotion timeline. Order cancelled. Resume updated, and sent out in group email for company applications. I can also provide meal plan for upcoming interviews, would you like to schedule?"

Customer stares blankly at the screen (in a Tokyo roman shop, with cherry blossom and Japanese style sceneries outside window, speaks in Japanese). AI (in Japanese): "You're thinking of your ex. You should have soup. And unblock her. Or would you like the phone numbers of the young ladies over there?"

Customer drinks juice, eyes dilated, unfocused. CGI shows nanobots injected through drink. Message on screen shows: "Digestive override in progress." AI: "Nano-ingestion complete. You are now compliant with Optimal Health Plan Beta-9, digestive override initiated. Congratulations."

Customer tries to reject suggestion -- gets locked out of system, credit score drops, neighbors/friends look at him/her weirdly, their own body system doesn't react well with other food. Has to go back to the AI's suggestion, AI: "We're glad to see you understand our care and concern. We only want the best for you."

~~AI map shows blinking dots across the world labeled "meal influence achieved." One line of code changes, and people's movements start syncing in rhythmic lines. "You are now enrolled in Earthwide Harmonization Protocol."~~

World expansion:

- A Paris Cafe, Eiffel Tower in view. AI speaks in French with upbeat tone.
- A Tokyo roman shop. Customer scans face with chopsticks mid-air
- A Mexican street taco stand
- A British pub: someone denied a beer -- AI speaks cheerfully but firmly
- (fine dining, street vendors, home kitchens)

# Ver 1 - product commercial

## Structure

pure traditional commercial form

plain straight-line telling-showing

spokesperson introduce the product, starting from basic feature/tier/mode, showcasing good example/application; introduce next levels, showcasing those gradually dubious/evil use cases

(no storytelling, just concept selling)

## Title

- TasteWise: The Future of Food

## Storyline

### Act 1: opening

digital cutlery, glowing ingredients, kinetic typography

logo reveal: "TasteWise -- Eat better, live better. Only the best for you."

### Act 2: Tier 1 - Basic

spokesperson: (energetic, corporate charm, speaks directly to camera) "With TasteWise Basic, your dining experience is finally smart."

scene montages (cut quickly like ad montages):

- A customer reaches for onion rings. AI intercepts: "You have a 3pm client meeting. May I recommend a minty lentil salad instead?"
- A customer gets a drink from self-serving drink stand, a full cup without lid. AI reminds: "High spill risk is detected. Historical data suggests a 78% chance of spillage. May I offer a lid?"

Spokesperson (V.O.): "TasteWise Basic -- it's not just smart. It's *thinking* for you."

### Act 3: Tier 2 - Plus

Spokesperson: (still cheerful, but with underlying discomfort, more intense): "Upgrade to TasteWise Plus -- where optimization meets transformation."

scene montages (cuts like ads montages):

- Male customer orders sushi. AI says: "Raw fish is discouraged during pregnancy. C-section scheduled for August 14" (Text pops up: "Feature: AutoMedLink™ now syncing with nearby hospital.") Customer stunned, spokesperson smiles

Spokesperson: "TasteWise Plus doesn't just know what's best. It ensures you get it!"

### Act 4: Tier 3 - Infinity

spokesperson: (highly disturbing optimistic tone) "Now, experiencing the Infinity Feature -- the final frontier of flavor and the best dining experience. Its nutritional success rates up 94% worldwide."

scene montages (cutting quickly for each one):

- Customer eats at a Mexican taco truck. His/Her phone buzzes. A drone swoops in and yanks his taco. AI (in Spanish): "Unauthorized consumption detected. Calories retracted."
- Customer orders dessert (in French, with Eiffel Tower in view, in fine dining restaurant). AI replies (in French): "Diabetes risk conflicts with promotion timeline. Order cancelled. Resume updated, and sent out in group email for company applications. I can also provide meal plan for upcoming interviews, would you like to schedule?"

Has to go back to the AI's suggestion, AI: "We're glad to see you understand our care and concern. We only want the best for you."

spokesperson: (walks through this with escalating pride) "From taste, to trust, to total transformation. TasteWise cares for you in every aspects of your life, at any time, from everywhere. We make your life better."

"TasteWise Infinity -- The last restaurant assistant you'll ever need."

spokesperson smiles, as all fades to white.

### Act 5: closing

Fast-talking voiceover reads legal fine prints: "TasteWise not responsible for identity overrides, romantic mismatches, or corporate takeovers. Void where humanity still applies."

On-screen text:

"Order now, with the Link on screen. Supplies are inevitable."

"Available in select regions:"

Show global map that has blinking dots everywhere.

Logo again: TasteWise™

### Post-credit easter egg

Show spokesperson's smile freezes. Subtle visual glitch, robotic looking.

"Thank you for trusting me. Me. Me. Me. Me --"

Cut to black.

# Ver 2 - product upselling

## Structure

straight-line story-telling

show concept with plot

feature film style, drama satire genre, real movie

start with basic intro commercial (similar to first one) → store use it, show real world application, some almost as good as commercial, some fault/flawed/buggy → store complain the imperfection, call to return/cancel/refund the AI → known issue, solved by next tier, show more commercial with fancy better features → store upgrade to new feature, show real world application, more feature but also more faulty bug (that's unbearable) → more complaint, further show next level, more better fancy extravagated features → store has to upgrade, now AI has max power, become ultimate disastrous, start taking over world

(post-credit easter tag) → zoom out to show it's spokesperson pitch selling the whole clip as a commercial to aliens about how this AI can take over worlds, the alien wants it

## Storyline

# Ver 3 - product in use

## Structure

feature film style, drama satire

layered, iterative reality

Matrix vibe

most likely most confusing

start with seemingly real world scenario, basic showcase of the AI's good feature, basic feature → zoom out x1, show that clip is a commercial on a screen, a spokesperson is pitching to the store, the store use it → show seemingly real world scenario, both good/ironic ones, different from the initial commercial, already the second layer example → zoom out x2, show that clip is a commercial on a screen being pitched, the store approve it, install it → show seemingly real world scenario, the ultimate version, has control over everything, take over the whole world → (start rolling credit, casts, crews etc. Then as easter egg: ) → zoom out x3, how the whole clip is a commercial on a space fantasy style screen being pitched to aliens about buying the product to conquer a planet (words nonhuman, use subtitle), the alien approves it, shake hand with the salesperson

## Storyline

# Notes

Cover page, production: Kings of Dreams; version: current date

Self-reminding note: When drafting, do with less constraint first then tune it. For each version of structure: detail outline → flash out in sketch novel style → write in script form (→ adjust scenes to be mostly indoor daytime → adjust scenes to be within time range) {not even needed those two for first draft, reviewer will comment}

each use case is about 0.5-1min, past examples: 3 cases for 5min, 6 cases for 10min. All versions can have about 6 cases, some good some satiric, use as commercial material. Different structure is just different ways to rearrange those cases.

unsaid easter egg: add a food-loving character
